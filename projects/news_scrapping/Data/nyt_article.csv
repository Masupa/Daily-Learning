,"Pilgrims have been coming to Switzerland’s  . since shortly after St. Meinrad, the Martyr of Hospitality, retreated to the secluded “Dark Forest” in a valley between Lake Zurich and Lake Lucerne to establish a hermitage around 835. .I visited the abbey in October 2019 at the start of an unusual pilgrimage: to travel in the footsteps of the Swiss tennis player  . As Switzerland’s best-known pilgrimage site, it seemed like an auspicious place to start my journey. I had no idea that Mr. Federer had a connection to the place, but when I contacted the abbey to arrange my visit, the monks had a surprise for me. “Did you know our abbot is also named Federer?” asked Marc Dosch, the abbey’s lay representative. I had not. “Yes and he baptized Roger’s children.” .Destiny, indeed. .I’ve been a tennis player since the late 1970s, but a knee surgery and a series of health problems have kept me off the court for several years. I was on the road to recovery and was hoping to make a comeback on hallowed ground: the courts where Mr. Federer had trained in Switzerland on his way to winning 20 majors and becoming one of the planet’s most beloved athletes. .I’ve been a fan for more than 15 years, but my admiration reached new levels in 2017 when Mr. Federer won two majors at 35 after nearly every tennis writer had already written his tennis obituary. He could have quietly drifted off to the Alps to meditate while counting his Swiss francs, but instead he rededicated himself to the sport and turned the tables on his younger rivals. .A knee injury forced Mr. Federer to take more than a year off the ATP Tour. But he returned to competition in Doha, Qatar, a few weeks ago, where he won one match and lost another. It wasn’t a dream return but it was a promising start, and I’m relieved that he appears to be healthy and motivated. Like all fans, I’m hopeful he will have more trophies to hoist — perhaps this summer at Wimbledon or at the Olympic Games. .But I also live with the fear that he might retire soon, and so I felt a sense of urgency to make this journey before it was too late to see him play in person. .Little did I know back in October 2019 that my trip to Switzerland would be the last border I’d be crossing for a long time because of travel restrictions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The fact that I was able to walk in Mr. Federer’s footsteps, and sit in a packed arena with 10,000 unmasked fans and watch him play feels like a dream to me now. .But as I prepared for my trip, I found myself having to reassure Swiss sources I wanted to meet that I wasn’t a crazed stalker who planned to rifle through Mr. Federer’s trash cans. I assured them that I’m just a normal guy who admires his graceful strokes, his sportsmanship and his willingness to shed tears on the court. I reckoned that traveling across seven cantons to the places where Mr. Federer has lived and played tennis before watching him at the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his hometown tennis tournament, would help me understand not just the man but also Switzerland, that prosperous, heartbreakingly beautiful but enigmatic, four-language outlier in the heart of Europe. .I contemplated my journey standing on a hilltop looking down at  ., with its twin-spired, Baroque-style church and horses and mooing cows dotting the lush, green hills, before being welcomed by Abbot Federer, who greeted me like an old friend. “You know, before Roger became famous, I always used to have to spell my name,” he told me. “But now everyone knows the name Federer.” .Abbot Federer said his branch of the family tree intersected with Mr. Federer’s in the 16th century, but he said that he didn’t discuss their shared ancestry or Mr. Federer’s attendance at Mass (none of his business, he said) with the Swiss star when he visited the abbey. Abbot Federer said the Swiss aren’t comfortable with hero worship. “Roger would be equivalent to something like the royal family in the U.K., but here in Switzerland, we’ve never had a super-famous star, so we don’t know how to treat him because we don’t revere people here,” he said. .He was right — I had brought a Roger Federer hat with me, but stopped wearing it after realizing that no one else was wearing one. Just before he ducked into the cathedral to pray, Abbot Federer told me, “I really hope  . doesn’t win any more titles. I don’t want him to catch Roger.” .Abbot Federer also happened to be a relative of Antonia Federer, the wife of Jakob Federer, a vintner and consultant who invited me for lunch at their home in Berneck, a pretty country town of some 4,000 people near the Austrian border where the Federer clan originated. The German word feder, Jakob explained, means feather or quill, and in the Middle Ages, Federers were scribes. There are about 100 Federers in the village and it’s a common name in the cemetery where Roger Federer’s grandmother is buried behind the town’s ancient Catholic church. .Jakob Federer is the vice president of Berneck and he lives just a few doors from the medieval home where Roger’s father, Robert, was raised. He explained that there was a schism in the Federer clan after a fire ravaged Berneck in 1848; one branch of the family was blamed and were expelled. .We visited a wine cellar,  ., where Jakob ages his  . brand wine in giant oak barrels. After a vegetarian lunch, the village president, Bruno Seelos, stopped by for a chat. Mr. Seelos explained that the village planned to name something after Roger Federer, but they were waiting until he retired. Jakob and Antonia weren’t convinced this was necessary. “It’s like a cult of personality,” she said. .By the third day of my pilgrimage, I was itching to see if I was fit enough to return to tennis. Using intel I picked up from René Stauffer’s  . and my own research, I identified nearly a dozen tennis clubs around the country that I wanted to visit — many are clubs where Mr. Federer currently trains, others are places where he developed his game as a junior. .I found my opportunity that afternoon at  ., a posh club of well-groomed red clay courts with stunning views over Lake Zurich where Mr. Federer is known to practice. I cornered Alan, a club member who was enjoying a post-tennis coffee in the club’s cafe, and convinced him to hit with me for a few minutes. I was rusty, spraying balls around the court with little idea of where they might land. .The next day, I made my way by train and bus to the venerable  . a century-old lodge with a Turkish-style hammam nestled in the picturesque village of Lenzerheide, deep in the Swiss Alps in the canton of Graubünden. Roger and his family moved to the neighboring village of Valbella in 2012, and I wanted to understand why he had chosen to live in this out-of-the-way place, instead of one of Switzerland’s more famous winter resorts like Zermatt, Gstaad or St. Moritz. .I was hoping I might get a tryout with Toni Poltera, a gregarious morning host for the Romansch language radio service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation and the president of  ., a club where Roger has trained on several occasions. Mr. Poltera drove us south on a snaking country road past villages perched on green hillsides below jagged peaks that would soon be full of snow toward the village of Lain. .As we got out to look at a remote playground where Mr. Poltera told me Roger Federer likes to take his family, it was easy to understand why he would want to live in such a place. “You see,” Mr. Poltera said, sweeping his right hand toward a snow-capped peak, “here Roger can have peace, he can play with his kids like a normal person.” .Turning north, we ventured into Valbella, a charming little community with a handful of businesses and Alpine-style homes perched across a hillside with views of Lake Heidsee and nearby mountains. I never asked Mr. Poltera to show me Mr. Federer’s house, but he pre-empted any potential request, explaining, “Roger lives here for privacy, that’s why we’re  .going to drive by his home.” .Tennisclub Felsberg, a half-hour drive down a zigzagging road from Valbella, is an out-of-the-way place with three courts situated along the Rhine. “We’re playing on Roger’s court,” Mr. Poltera said, pointing to a sign above Court 1 labeled “Roger Platz.” He led me to a small dressing room with a humble shower and sink. “You’ll get dressed and take your shower here, just like Roger does.” .I muffed several of my first shots but quickly found a groove and fell into a blissful tennis trance. .The next morning I woke up, stoked to finally see Mr. Federer play at the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel. I sat in an empty train carriage bathed in sunshine as it shadowed the Rhine, past crumbling medieval castles, spiky mountain peaks and hamlets spilling across carpets of green grass. .I arrived in plenty of time to watch Mr. Federer demolish the hapless Moldovan Radu Albot in his second-round match at the indoor  ., where Mr. Federer served as a ball boy as a kid. .In between matches, I explored Basel’s charming old town and visited a host of Federer sites, including ., the stately, 17th-century English manor house where Mr. Federer and his wife, Mirka, were married in 2009; the  ., where the tennis star honed his game as a child; and the “Swiss Tennis House”  . in Biel, where I met Yves Allegro, who was Mr. Federer’s roommate when they trained at the facility in 1997. .A few days later, I went to the five-star  . overlooking the Rhine, where cheeseburgers at the bar go for $48, and as I walked across the chandelier-heavy lobby, I nearly bumped into one of Mr. Federer’s twin daughters, who were joyfully bounding down a grand staircase with the tennis player’s father, Robert, trailing. .On the morning of the final, I took the tram to Münchenstein, the Basel suburb where Roger spent most of his childhood. Daniel Altermatt, a Münchenstein city councilperson, greeted me on the platform wearing a beret and dark sunglasses. He took me on an extensive tour of the town, starting with the small housing development called Wasserhaus, where Mr. Federer grew up. .His block felt narrow, too cramped for a person of his stature. Around the corner, on a small street with a canopy of trees, Mr. Altermatt explained how someone had tried to unofficially rename the street Roger Federer Allée. “We have a local regulation prohibiting us from naming anything after anyone who is still alive,” he said. “So if we want to name something after Roger, we’d have to kill him first.” .Mr. Altermatt drove me to the arena, where I bumped into Marc Dosch, who was there for the final with Abbot Federer. “I lost the abbot,” he said, and I wondered if perhaps he was giving Mr. Federer a prematch blessing. .Whatever the case, Mr. Federer was great once again, dismantling the Australian player  . a surprise finalist, to capture his record 10th Swiss Indoors title in what seemed like an anticlimactic final until Mr. Federer broke down in tears during his victory speech. He appeared in the pressroom carrying his trophy after the match, and this time he was still in his tennis gear. He had literally won the tournament without breaking a sweat. .I showed Mr. Federer a photo of him hoisting a trophy at age 10, that was given to me by Madeline Bärlocher, one of his first coaches at the Old Boys club, and asked him if the feeling of lifting trophies had changed over the years. “It’s similar,” he said, smiling. “It’s been an incredible journey, it definitely hit me hard being here in Basel. I don’t take these tournament victories as a normal thing, I take it as something quite unique and special even though it’s been a lot by now.” .And what, I asked, had triggered his tears on court. “When I stand there and look back at everything I had to go through, it really touches me,” he said. Mr. Federer said that he tends to break down depending “on the applause of the people, how warm it is, how much they feel that I’m struggling or not and how much love I get.” .As I waited for the tram, it started to rain and I remembered that I had my Roger Federer hat buried in my bag. I hadn’t worn it in more than a week, but now it was time to put my hat back on and return home — a tennis player once again.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/travel/roger-federer-switzerland.html
,"Life can change in an instant, as I experienced when I first laid my eyes on a tall and bizarrely striking bird known as the greater adjutant. .It was India in 2018, in the northeastern state of Assam. I’d ended up there partly because of absurd circumstances, which involved being filmed for a reality television pilot while navigating a motorized rickshaw through the Himalayas. After traversing some of the highest and most dangerous roads in the world, including the Tanglang La mountain pass, I ventured off to see a  .: Asian elephants, greater one-horned rhinos, western hoolock gibbons. .While en route to Guwahati, Assam’s capital, I saw a five-foot-tall bird towering near the roadside. I was so taken by its appearance that I asked the driver to pull over so I could have a better look. It had piercing blue eyes, an elongated electric-yellow neck, a wobbly, inflatable neck pouch, long legs that moved with a stiff military gait, and spindly black hairs atop its (mostly bald) prehistoric-looking head. Little did I know that this outlandish animal — also endangered, though not famously so — would change the course of my professional life. .Seeing how intrigued I was by the giant stork, the driver offered to take me to the site of the largest year-round population of greater adjutants in the world. .To my surprise, he led me to the sprawling Boragaon landfill, a dumpsite that borders the Deepor Beel wetland, an  . threatened by pollution and encroachment. .As we pulled into the landfill, I felt like I was entering a post-apocalyptic fever dream: Refuse was piled up higher than an East Village tenement building. I saw countless people, including young children, sorting through the garbage with their bare hands. Cows were grazing on medical waste, and feral dogs chased each other through the mountains of trash. All the while, an excavator kept pushing the trash heap taller and taller. .In the middle of this surreal scene, scavenging beside garbage-stained  ., were the spectacular greater adjutants, who were circling and stiffly marching alongside the other foragers. .After returning from India, I realized that my encounter with the greater adjutants had irrevocably changed me. Until then, I’d doggedly chased a career in New York City as a comedic ventriloquist while juggling mundane day jobs. Wildlife photography was relatively new to me; I had only considered it an enjoyable hobby. But suddenly I wanted to pursue conservation photography with every fiber of my being. .I quickly discovered the work of  ., a wildlife biologist who has dedicated her life to protecting greater adjutants. The founder of the  ., a local all-female, grass-roots volunteer conservation effort, Dr. Barman led her corps of women in protecting nesting sites, saving fallen baby birds and educating the Assamese community on the importance of these  .. .After corresponding with Dr. Barman for several months, I traveled back to Assam in February 2020. Dr. Barman invited me to stay at her home in Guwahati, where she lives with her husband, who is also a wildlife biologist, and her twin teenage daughters. .On our first visit together to the villages of Dadara, Pacharia and Singimari, on the outskirts of Guwahati, Dr. Barman continuously pointed out her car window at “hargilas,” the local word for greater adjutants that is derived from the Sanskrit word for “bone swallower.” I couldn’t believe how many of the birds were peering down at us from their huge nests and soaring on thermals high above our heads — especially since, in 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated that only between 800 and 1,200 mature individuals were left in existence, with the population in decline. .Assam is the last stronghold of this endangered species, harboring more than 80 percent of the greater adjutant’s global population. (The remaining population is split between Cambodia and the Indian state of Bihar.) .In the past, Dr. Barman explained, greater adjutants were viewed as unsanitary nuisances and believed to be bad omens, resulting in many of their nesting trees being cut down. Much of the Hargila Army’s efforts are aimed at protecting such trees. .The group’s efforts are also directed at rehabilitating society’s perception of the birds — to “bring the birds into the hearts, minds and cultures of the people,” Dr. Barman said. Conservation work has long been plagued by  ., since humans generally favor  .. “The more people who see hargilas as a bad omen, disease-carrier and pest,” Dr. Barman told me, “the more I am obsessed.” .The work has paid dividends. The greater adjutant’s local population has risen to an estimated 950 birds, up from 400 birds in 2007. The number of nesting colonies in the villages of Dadara, Pacharia and Singimari has also risen during the same interval — to 220 nests, up from 28. .In recent years the Hargila Army has grown to include thousands of pledged members — people who have received some level of conservation training — and around 400 women who are actively involved in leading the movement. Most of its organizers are rural homemakers who are helping to integrate an appreciation for greater adjutants into local traditions. They  . and even throw baby showers for the birds during the breeding season. .The most distinctive awareness program I witnessed was at a local wedding that included effigies of the giant bird guarding the entrance and hargila-themed henna drawn on the hands and arms of wedding guests, myself included. .Dr. Barman’s efforts have led to a broader sense of empowerment among the women who make up the Hargila Army. Many receive tools and training — including donated hand looms and sewing machines — that can help them earn additional income. .“It seems like our life has completely changed after integrating hargila motifs into our clothes,” said a member of the Hargila Army named Jonali Rajbongshi, who, after receiving a new sewing machine, began sewing cotton bags embroidered with greater adjutants. .We also visited the house of a woman named Pratibha Malakar, who wove a red-and-white hargila gamosa — a traditional  . — with transfixing speed and expertise. .Dr. Barman told me that her community conservation model could easily be reproduced in other parts of the world. “Women are the key and the biggest change makers,” she explained. “When we educate women, when we involve women, we achieve a sustainable goal.” .Awareness programs among local schools are another of the group’s tactics, and I went along with Dr. Barman on a few such surprise visits. Her presentations, which include lively discussions, informational pamphlets, educational games and coloring pages, had the students on the edges of their seats. .Near the end of my time in Assam, I accompanied Dr. Barman and her team back to the Boragaon landfill, where she led an outreach program. Children sat among the debris, eating sweets and coloring in drawings of the eccentric storks. .In the middle of her presentation, I looked around to find our corner of the landfill filled with laughter and gaiety. It was an unexpected joyous moment: all of us brought together from such different circumstances by a remarkable woman and an endangered, if often overlooked, scavenger — the unlikely target of a spellbinding and transformative conservation campaign.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/travel/india-greater-adjutant-stork.html
,"For six days, Paul Theroux, the famous American travel writer, dined on hard-boiled eggs, microwaved dal and wine. .He had set out cross-country in a rented Jeep Compass on the day before Thanksgiving, driving from Cape Cod, where he has a house, to Los Angeles, where he delivered boxes of his papers to his archives at Huntington Library, and then flying on to Hawaii, his other home. .Theroux said he observed a landscape largely emptied out by the coronavirus pandemic, from deserted motels in Sallisaw, Okla., and Tucumcari, N.M., where he stopped to sleep, to a rest area in Tennessee where he had his solitary Thanksgiving meal, and the In-N-Out Burger in Kingman, Ariz., on his last day on the road. Every night, as is his habit, he wrote out in longhand all he had seen. .“It was like a panning shot of America,” he said in a video interview from the North Shore of Oahu, where he has lived off and on for over 30 years. .Theroux turns 80 in April. For a generation of backpackers now gone gray, the tattered paperback accounts of his treks through China, Africa and South America were a prod to adventure, bibles of inspiration under many a mosquito net. He has a new novel out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April, “Under the Wave at Waimea,” and his best-known book (and  . among them), “ .,” has been adapted into a television series starring his nephew, Justin Theroux, also set to premiere next month. .If this seems like a moment to take stock of an intrepid life and an almost extreme output of writing, Theroux does not see himself as anywhere near done. Before Covid-19 struck, he had plans to go to central Africa. He is deep into another novel and finishing up a new story collection. He himself can’t seem to keep track of the number of books he has written: “Fifty-something maybe?” (It’s actually 56.) .Travel narratives are his signature, a genre he grabbed onto in the early 1970s out of desperation when, as a young novelist with a few books under his belt, he found himself out of ideas. He decided to traverse part of the world by rail, starting from London, where he was living, through the Middle East and as far as Southeast Asia, returning on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The account that emerged from this tiring journey, “ .,” has sold over 1.5 million copies and inspired shelves upon shelves of books built on similar conceits. .In just the past decade, Theroux has written about  . (he always travels alone) in “On the Plain of Snakes” (2019); an exploration of some of the poorest regions of his own country in “ .” (2015); and a trip to Africa, “ .” (2013), in which he returned to regions he got to know as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s. .This genre — the outsider arrives and offers an assessment of the foreign — has lost ground over the years to travel memoirs like Elizabeth Gilbert’s “ .” that describe journeys of the internal terrain as much as the people encountered and places seen. Theroux, sitting at his desk scattered with artifacts of those trips — tiny Buddhas, the skull of a scrimshawed monkey he was given in Bali, wooden Polynesian weapons — defended his approach. .“It’s more necessary than ever to find the empathetic experience of meeting another person, being in another culture, to smell it, to suffer it, to put up with the hardship and the nuisances of travel, all of that matters,” Theroux said. He quoted the Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul, who at various moments in Theroux’s writing career  .: “I believe that the present, accurately seized, foretells the future.” .And Theroux agrees. “You don’t have to make forecasts,” he said. “You just write about the things that you see, the things that you hear, the things that you sense, and when you write that, you’re a prophet.” .But there is no great thirst for prophets these days, particularly of the sort who offer judgments of other cultures. Theroux seems aware of this, or at least of the notion that his way of writing about the world is fading. .His new novel tells the story of Joe Sharkey, an aging North Shore surfer who resembles characters Theroux has gotten to know on the beaches near his home. Sharkey feels acutely that he is being overtaken by younger surfers with big endorsements. For him, surfing was a way of life, an existence centered on catching waves, a commitment to the ocean. .Theroux sees surfing as a metaphor for his own life. All he ever wanted was to be able to write without interruption, without the distraction of car alarms going off outside his window or bills arriving in the mail, without the need to do anything else for money but sit day after day at his desk. In many ways, Theroux has achieved this. But like the surfer past his prime, he is not immune to feeling forgotten, to the sense that the world has become hostile to the pure joy of the waves. There’s a fear of being overlooked, unread. .“I was once a hot shot, I was once the punk,” Theroux said. “And anyone who has once been a punk, eventually you’re older, and you see the turning of the years as it is. We all feel it, every writer. They might deny it. But they do, they all feel it.” .There was no sign of Theroux’s storied grumpiness. Critiques of his books have often touched on their cruelly ironic tone, a sense of condescension toward people he meets and fictional characters he creates. Take Stephen King’s assessment in The Book Review of the lightly autobiographical “ .” from 2017, which King found to be an “exercise in self-regarding arrogance and self-pity.” .Theroux gets that readers might perceive him as cranky, but he thinks the problem might be with the readers. “You cannot be a grumpy traveler. You will not get anywhere,” he said. “You’ll be killed, you’ll be insulted, you won’t be able to travel. So you need to get along with people. I think that I’m characterized as cantankerous perhaps because if you see things the way they are, and you just describe things the way they are, you can be accused of being unkind.” .One of his oldest friends, the British  ., with whom Theroux has swapped manuscripts over the decades, thinks critics have missed an important shift in Theroux’s writing. “Compared to the tone of the earlier work, its sarcasm, its sharp observation and always being from the point of view of an absolute outsider, Paul has developed a kind of humanity in the recent books that I hadn’t seen before,” Raban said. .He pointed to a  . about a pet goose named Willy whom Theroux raised from birth and cradled in his arms as he died, the animal’s blue eyes gone gray, in a moment described with aching vulnerability. For Raban, this piece, like Theroux’s past few books, signals a move closer to the reader. “From savage sarcasm to tenderness is a pretty long journey,” Raban said. .Age has also played its role. Theroux sees advantages in it, like the older surfer whose decreased stamina forces him to search for new, smarter ways to ride his board — after all, Theroux points out, it was a man in his late 40s, Garrett McNamara, who surfed the largest recorded wave. Theroux can see how traveling as an octogenarian will have its assets. In some cultures, older people are invisible, a benefit in many situations, he said. .In other places he has visited, the elderly are treated with respect. “They either jump out of their chair and give it to you, or they just ignore you,” Theroux said. .And where might he want to go to next? “There are lots of places I’d like to go,” he said. “And there are lots of places I’ve never been. I’ve never been to Scandinavia, but I don’t have any desire to go there.” .What he most wants to do is return. There is value in making your way back to a country you visited when you were younger. It both marks time in your own life and acts as a sort of gauge for how a society is changing. .“It tells you about the direction of the world,” Theroux said. “What’s going to happen to the world? And you find that you can extrapolate that by revisiting a place that you knew well. Going back to England, going back to Malawi, going back to China, to India. It’s a fascinating thing. So if you ask me what travel I’m most looking forward to: I like going back to places.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/books/paul-theroux-under-the-wave-at-waimea.html

,"Over the course of the decade since I first visited, I have often imagined myself at home in New Orleans. I think of the syncopated shuffle of a snare drum, the simple pleasure of an afternoon walk with a to-go beer in hand and the candy-colored shotgun houses that sink into the ground at odd angles. And so it wasn’t a huge surprise when, at the beginning of 2021, I found myself packing up my life and moving to the Crescent City for a few months. Why not be somewhere I love at this difficult time, I thought? Why not live in my daydreams for a little while? . is above all else resilient. Mardi Gras parades were canceled this year, though it didn’t stop New Orleanians from . (nothing ever will). In recent months, brass bands have taken to street corners in front of masked, socially distant spectators instead of packed night clubs. Strangers still chat you up about the  . from their front porches. My visions of this city may still be filtered through the fuzzy lens of a visitor, but I know I’ll be pretending I’m still there long after I’m gone. Here are a few ways you can, too. .New Orleans music is a collage of sounds: it’s the birthplace of jazz, of the frenetic dance music known as  ., popularized by superstars like  ., the call-and-response songs of  ., and so much more. For an overview of the sounds of this loud, percussive city there is no better place to start than the wonderfully eclectic  ., a community-supported radio station that has been on the air since 1980. Luckily, you can listen to it from anywhere  .. It’s only a matter of time before you start getting to know the various D.J.s and tuning in for your favorites. .“New Orleans is not a periphery music scene,” Soul Sister, who has hosted  . for more than 25 years, told me. “New Orleans is the reason for it all.” Soul Sister was one of a handful of local experts I consulted in putting together  . that will send you straight to New Orleans. Among her recommendations are  . and the music of  ., which brings her back to afternoons spent celebrating on the street: “It reminds me of the energy and freedom of being at the second line parades on Sundays, dancing through all the neighborhoods nonstop for three or four hours,” she said. .On this playlist, you will also find some classics — the rollicking piano of  ., for example, starts it off — recommended by Keith Spera who writes about music for the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate. By the end of the playlist, you will undoubtedly agree with Mr. Spera’s assessment of New Orleans music: “There is no singular style of ‘New Orleans music’ — is it jazz? Rhythm & blues? Funk? Bounce? — but you know it when you hear it.” .Just like its music, New Orleans food contains multitudes: Creole, Cajun, African, Vietnamese and other flavors collide like nowhere else. A fine place to start is with the  ., the collected recipes of  ., who died in 2019, of Dooky Chase’s Restaurant, an institution that has hosted civil rights leaders, presidents and countless regulars at its location in Treme, the neighborhood where jazz was born.

Ms. Martin recommends making her grandmother’s  .. “I can picture her stirring a pot on Bayou Petit Caillou and seasoning a broth with salty Louisiana oysters, Creole tomatoes and salted pork,” Ms. Martin said. “The marriage of three ingredients transports me to the tiny fishing village I call home, where salt was and still is always in the air.” .“It is New Orleans’ best kept secret,” the chef Linda Green, better known as Ms. Linda, told me when I asked about her specialty. Festival and second line crowds come to her for ya-ka-mein, a salty beef noodle soup often eaten as a late-night snack or a next-morning cure (hence its “Old Sober” moniker). The dish’s origins are mysterious: a product of cultural exchange involving, depending on who you ask, Black soldiers returning from the Korean War or Chinese railroad workers arriving in the 1800s. Ms. Linda’s family recipe is also a mystery (she credits the globe-trotting chef  . for encouraging her to keep it secret). But she has shared  ., so you can try your hand at it at home. “That will get you pretty close to the real thing,” she said with a wink I could almost hear over the phone. .New Orleans is a city full of history and it can be hard to know what you are looking at without some guidance. You can feel like you are on your own personal walking tour thanks to  ., which has transferred their expertise to YouTube. You can now  ., pull away the sensationalism around  . and take a deep dive into jazz history in  .. “New Orleans is full of painful history, and it’s also known as one of the most fun cities in the world,” Andrew Farrier, one of the tour guides, said. “I think it’s useful for all of us to know how those two things can live so close to each other.” .Contrary to so many pop culture depictions of the city,  . extends far beyond the vortex of debauchery that is Bourbon Street. There are the classic New Orleans inventions, of course, like the  ., but for something a little different, turn to one of the city’s most revered mixologists.

What is a set-up, you ask? It’s a staple dive bar order that will get you a half-pint of your liquor of choice, a mixer and a stack of plastic cups.

Family Travel Gets Complicated Without a Covid Vaccine for Kids,"Nearly every summer, Ada Ayala, a teacher, and her husband, Oscar Cesar Pleguezeulos, travel with their children to visit Mr. Cesar Pleguezeulos’s parents in Spain. But this year, even though they will both soon be fully vaccinated in their home state of Florida, they are changing their plans. The reason? There is still no pediatric Covid-19 vaccine available for their kids. .The travel industry, buoyed by news of vaccine rollouts, is  . after a year of devastation. But amid the chatter of travel’s long-awaited rebound, many families with children —  . — say they are largely being left out of the conversation. .In a March survey on  ., an online community for traveling families, 90 percent of respondents said that amid unclear guidelines on Covid-19 testing, they were searching for flexible bookings. The topic also comes up often on Bébé Voyage’s Facebook page, particularly among parents in the United States. “It’s the Americans in the group that are the most nervous traveling with kids,” said the Bébé Voyage chief executive, Marianne Perez de Fransius. .Ms. Ayala, 44, is among those nervous parents. “If it wasn’t for the kids, we would definitely be flying this summer,” she said. Ms. Ayala already received her shot as a teacher. Her husband, also 44, will soon receive his shots, too, because Florida recently opened vaccinations to those age 40 and up. But their children, Charlise, 6, and Oscar, 2, will have to wait many more months to be inoculated. .“My 2-year-old isn’t going to wear a mask for 10 hours on a flight, and I don’t know if I want to expose him for a 16-hour trip with layovers,” Ms. Ayala said. “I’ll feel more confident when vaccination reaches more people worldwide, or at least in the destinations we want to go.” . have now received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. But a full pediatric Covid-19 vaccine currently isn’t expected until the end of 2021 at the earliest, and while they wait, parents are struggling to figure out how they, too, can travel safely this summer, and even where their children are welcome as rules on quarantine and testing continue to shift. .“This is the elephant in the room right now,” said Cate Caruso, an adviser for Virtuoso, a network of luxury travel agencies, who also owns her own travel planning company,  .. The potential that a child could become infected with Covid-19 while abroad and not be allowed on a return flight, she said, is a major deterrent for parents. “Anywhere you go outside of the U.S. right now, you’ve got to think about how you’re going to get back in,” she said. “It’s leaving behind a whole bunch of people who are ready to go.” .In Ms. Ayala’s case, a compromise has been struck: If and when Spain — which is currently closed to American travelers — opens its borders, Mr. Cesar will travel to Spain with their daughter, Charlise, while Ms. Ayala will remain in Florida with Oscar. “She goes to school and is very good with wearing her mask, cleaning her hands and keeping distance,” Ms. Ayala said of her daughter. “So I think she can be safe. But it’s just not possible with a baby.” .But she doesn’t plan to stay home all summer. Whether or not her husband and daughter make it to Spain, Ms. Ayala is planning a family road trip at some point this summer, likely within Florida. .After a year of  .,  . and  ., many Americans are now ready to fly again: Online searches for late-summer flights are up as much as 75 percent, and hotels on both coasts are reporting that they are sold out through October. But families, more than any other travel sector, continue to play it safe. .Rovia, a membership-based global travel agency that works with both travelers and travel agents, reports that beach and camping destinations within driving distance are the most popular choices for families this summer. An exception? Disney World, which is seeing an uptick in reservations for summer from families looking to visit while capacity remains limited (and lines, as a result, remain shorter). .“The rate of couples traveling by air has increased faster, whereas families are still leaning toward travel by car and R.V. rentals,” said Jeff Gwynn, Rovia’s director of communications. .Montoya and Phil Hudson, who showcase their travels as a Black family on their popular blog,  ., are among them. “Most years we go pretty far — Spain, Italy, France, as far as we can go. This year it was about what’s reachable by car,” Ms. Hudson said. She and Mr. Hudson, who both work in the health care industry, are vaccinated, but admit they probably won’t be willing to fly with their two daughters, Leilah, 11, and Layla, 8, for several more months. .That’s because they want to wait for herd immunity to help keep their daughters safe. “The goal is to wait until the majority of the population is vaccinated, or has at least had the opportunity to become vaccinated,” Ms. Hudson said. .In addition to preferring driving over flying this summer, travel analysts say families with children will also continue to opt for rental homes over hotel rooms. .In fact, when it comes to the vacation cottage market, parents are booking faster than anyone else. “Families are the number one group expected to travel in 2021,” said Vered Schwarz, the president and chief operating officer of  ., a short-term property management platform which reports that its summer reservations are already 110 percent higher than 2020, with families comprising more than 30 percent of those booking. “For families with unvaccinated children, private rentals are appealing — they are comfortable and they avoid hotels chock-full of crowded common areas,” she said. .The question of how to treat unvaccinated children who may be traveling with their parents is also presenting a legal and ethical minefield for American travel operators. .The European Union is considering a  . that  . for those who can show proof of inoculation. In Israel, a  . has been established for those who have been vaccinated, granting holders not just the ability to cross a border but also check into a hotel or eat inside a restaurant, but children are not exempt — so parents with unvaccinated children must dine outside at restaurants and find babysitters before heading to the gym or a show. .But in the United States, such policies are unlikely to take hold, said Chuck Abbott, the general manager of the InterContinental San Diego. “Most hotels would not ask for that information, because it violates the privacy of the guest,” he said. “Even putting vaccinated guests on a different floor than other guests would likely present a legal issue.” .Compared with summer 2019, families’ plans for summer 2021 are more low-key: Travelocity reports that bookings to Mount Rushmore and Nashville are significantly up over two years ago; internationally, family bookings to London, Paris and Rome, destinations that were top family sites in 2019, but have still not reopened to U.S. travel, are way down, while Cancún, which is currently open to American travelers without quarantine requirements, is up nearly 50 percent. .Some European countries, like Iceland, have begun inching open their borders, but only to passengers who are vaccinated. That means individuals who can present proof of the Covid-19 jab can bypass quarantine when they arrive — unless they are parents traveling with children. .“Unvaccinated children would still need to quarantine for five days, and the parents, of course, must stay with the child,” said Eric Newman, who owns the travel blog  .. “Iceland’s brand-new travel regulations are not friendly to families hoping to visit with children.” .After a year of virtual schooling and working from home, parents have no desire to quarantine with their kids, said Anthony Berklich, the founder of the travel platform  .. “What these destinations are basically saying is you can come but your children can’t,” he said. .Instead, families are opting for warm-weather destinations closer to home. .When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in January that  . of all air passengers arriving in the United States, many tropical resorts — including  . — began offering not just free on-site testing, but a deeply discounted room in which to quarantine in case that test comes back positive. That move, said Rebecca Alesia, a travel consultant with  ., has been a boon for family travel business. .“What happens if the morning you’re supposed to come home, you get up and Junior has a surprise positive test?” she said. “A lot of my clients have booked this summer because of this policy.” .For parents struggling to decide how and when to return to travel, there is good news on the horizon, said Dr. Shruti Gohil, the medical director of infection prevention at the University of California, Irvine. .“The chances of a good pediatric vaccine coming soon are high,” she said, noting that both Pfizer and Moderna are already running pediatric trials on their vaccines. “There is no reason to think that the vaccine will have any untoward effects on children that we haven’t already noted in adults.” .In the meantime, she said, parents with children need to continue to be cautious. That doesn’t mean families shouldn’t travel at all, but she recommends choosing to drive rather than fly; to not allow unvaccinated children to play unmasked with children from other households; and to remain vigilant about wearing masks and regularly washing hands while on the road. .“We can’t keep saying that you can’t go anywhere,” she said. “At some point we have to have some kind of nuance around this. But this is a game we are all still playing until the virus is gone.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/travel/children-family-vaccines.html
Air Travel Is Already Back to Normal in Some Places. Here’s Where.,"In Florida, Key West International Airport is busier than normal, while Miami International has half as many passengers as it did before the pandemic. .In the West, big-city airports — in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle — are serving a fraction of their typical traveler volume, between 24 percent and 46 percent. But smaller regional airports, near Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Colorado ski country, have passenger volume as much as 12 percent higher than this time last year. .This pattern is typical across the country, detailed new data shows. Large hub airports have just a fraction of the travelers they did at this time last year, even as Americans are returning to flying, particularly to vacation destinations. .“You see airports in Colorado, Montana, Key West having recovered quite a lot,” said Kevin Williams, a Yale economist who studies air travel data. “And then you have a lot of major cities that are still down quite a lot.” .He has compiled granular Transportation Security Administration data that tracks how many people move through airport screening checkpoints. It shows that, with  . and states rolling back  ., Americans are returning to leisure travel in large numbers. .But airports that serve major cities are still serving far fewer travelers than they did early last year. Washington National, close to the District of Columbia, is down 70 percent in passenger volume. San Francisco International is serving a quarter of its typical volume, and Kennedy Airport in New York is at about one-third. .This may reflect in part the slower return of business travel. These hub airports also tend to have many international flights, which are expected to take longer to recover. Additionally, many urban attractions for leisure travelers — Broadway theaters in New York City, the Smithsonian museums in Washington — remain closed because of the pandemic. .A few dozen smaller airports, where travel is thriving in spite of growing coronavirus case numbers nationally, appear to fall into two categories: those especially close to outdoor vacation destinations, and those serving communities whose residents are more willing to travel amid a pandemic. .“The only thing that is different is the masks,” said Richard Strickland, airport director at Key West International, who has flown five times in the last five months. “We’re now busier than we were in 2019.” .Idaho Falls Regional Airport is about two hours from Yellowstone National Park, which attracted many visitors last year. The airport’s passenger volume is now 80 percent of what it was last year — a stronger recovery than at the state’s largest airport, in Boise, which is at roughly 60 percent of its regular travel volume. .Two other airports that serve Yellowstone, one in Wyoming and another in Montana, were fully back to prepandemic travel volume in early March. .“For late summer and through the fall, we were seeing close to the same numbers that we’d had in 2019,” said Rick Cloutier, executive director of the Idaho Falls airport. “We were fortunate recipients of the people’s desire to get to the great outdoors.” .Passenger volume has returned to normal at Canyonlands Field airport in Utah, near Arches National Park. On Florida’s Gulf Coast, airports near beaches are having a similarly good year. There were 24 percent more passengers passing through Northwest Florida Beaches airport in early March than around that time last year. .Airports in one outdoors vacation destination have remained notably empty, though: Hawaii’s airports are down between 51 percent and 84 percent in passenger volume. The state, which has had .Covid cases, requires visitors to obtain a negative test within  . or to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival, making travel there more complicated. The longer time spent on a flight may also scare away potential passengers. .Willingness to travel by airplane may also vary from one city to another. Americans have reacted differently to strategies to minimize the pandemic’s spread,  . and  .to varying levels. .“We seem to have been filling up when everybody else isn’t,” said Steve Gleason, executive director of Provo Municipal Airport. His airport is small — usually just about four or so flights a day — but busy. It’s not especially close to any national park. .Passenger traffic is down 2 percent compared with last year, while Salt Lake City International, an hour away, is still down 40 percent. Mr. Gleason says most of the rebound has to do with passengers traveling to see family through the pandemic or to students who attend Brigham Young University, which is holding in-person classes this semester. .“Most of our traffic is family traffic; they just kept flying,” he said. “It seems like everything shut down pretty solidly for two or three months, and then everybody picked back up again.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/upshot/flights-rebounding-vacations.html
The T List: Five Things We Recommend This Week,"visit This .Carmine Morales ran the tiny, locally beloved luncheonette Classic Coffee Shop .— one of the few remaining places in downtown New York where you could get a truly no-frills grilled cheese — on Hester Street for over 40 years before deciding to retire last .December. But he has entrusted the storefront, along with his decades-old drip coffee machine, to two new tenants: .the clothing designer  . and her partner, the furniture designer  ., who will keep it running in service to the neighborhood, if in a slightly different way. The couple have spent the past few weeks subtly reimagining the space as a hybrid coffee and tailoring shop, leaving the Styrofoam ceiling tiles in place but updating the counter at the front with vintage ’60-era teak stools from India and adding bent-metal sconces by Green River Project (the studio Aujla runs with his collaborator, Ben Bloomstein). At the back of the space, they’ve installed a bank of sewing machines, along with a plush changing area enveloped by a thick tobacco-colored velvet curtain. The flagship store of Bode’s namesake clothing brand, which offers one-of-a-kind pieces handmade from repurposed textiles such as vintage quilts and bed linens, is just next door, and she has long believed that garments should be altered and maintained over a lifetime. Offering a dedicated location for tailoring felt like an obvious next step. “I think it will open some of our clients’ eyes to the fact that it’s easy to shop in a way where there aren’t limitations based on size,” she says. But the space, which will open on Friday, is also intended as a resource for anyone with a textile conservation project or simple alteration need: “People can bring their grandmother’s saris but also their Levi’s jeans.” The Classic Coffee Shop was a family operation — it was Morales’s father who originally took over the space in 1976 — and Bode and Aujla will build on this tradition by weaving in their own personal histories: The coffee will be mixed with cardamom, just as Aujla’s grandmother served her Folgers after she moved from Punjab to Canada in the 1950s, and he eventually plans to offer Indian sweets, including jalebi and laddus. “But nothing fancy,” he says.  .book This .In the heart of central Portugal, near the Biblioteca Joanina, the University of Coimbra’s 18th-century Rococo-style library, is a new boutique hotel that will open in May from the storied Swedish bedding brand  . whose mission is to provide guests with one of the world’s best sleep experiences. Each of the 15 rooms at the Hästens Sleep Spa comes .equipped with one of the company’s triple-spring beds, which were carefully designed for optimal pressure, relief and support, while portions of its walls are adorned with decorative gold-plated marble that’s been hand-carved to resemble book spines. During a stay, guests can select an actual book from any number of shelves spread throughout the hotel to take with them when they turn in for the night. There is also an array of digital programming that helps create a soothing ambience, including relaxing soundtracks available through a mobile app and an in-room television channel called “Bed Talks,” hosted by the sleep expert Dr. Edie Perry, who shares insights on topics such as how to position one’s neck for quality rest and how best to support the lumbar spine throughout the night. To top it off, guests have access to an on-call sleep specialist for the duration of their stay and can select from a pillow menu of five options, all made from goose feathers and down and ranging from soft to extra firm.  .covet This .When Calico Wallpaper founders Rachel and Nick Cope designed their Aurora collection, consisting of 16 different multicolored ombrés, in 2013, they drew on memories of the various horizons they’d seen on their extensive travels — from seascapes in Tulum to sunsets in Tuscany. Stuck in their New York home last year, the couple found a new way to bring a global perspective to their work: They invited four international design studios to craft their own Aurora prints, each one just as personal as the originals. Launching this week, the new series — called Dawn — includes the Swiss designer  .’s cotton candy-like pink-and-teal version, inspired by .walks taken with his young daughter along the shore of Lake Neuchâtel in Romandy, and a dark blend of yellow and blue by the Shanghai-based duo Lyndon Neri and Rossana Hu of Neri & Hu that references their favorite Vermeer paintings. Milan’s Dimore Studio .chose a moody brick-red fade “that conjures the feelings of a smoke-filled lounge in the 1970s,” says Rachel, while Sabine Marcelis captured the orange-gray sky that can be seen from her studio in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, .at sundown. The couple gave their collaborators free rein, notes Rachel, and had each studio select a nonprofit organization — the U.N. Refugee Agency and the Environmental Defense Fund are among those chosen — to receive 5 percent of the proceeds from its design.  .see This .Work by the pioneering American land artist  . — perhaps best known for .“ .” (1973-76), a series of four concrete cylinders that are each 18 feet long and 9 feet in diameter, and are installed in aeternum in Utah’s desert flats — will be on display, beginning this week, at Ireland’s Lismore Castle Arts. Curated by Lisa Le Feuvre, the executive director at the Holt-Smithson Foundation, which upholds the legacies of both Holt and her husband, the artist Robert Smithson, “Light and Language” explores Holt’s output between 1966 and 1982 and includes indoor and outdoor installations, as well as photography and film. (There will also be a selection of pieces by five other artists, all of whom see their work as being in conversation with Holt’s: A.K. Burns, Matthew Day Jackson, Dennis McNulty, Charlotte Moth and Katie Paterson.) For Le Feuvre, the exhibition’s setting will be crucial to how it’s experienced: It’s “like going to see ‘Tunnels,’” she says, in that “you get a sense of slowness, quietness and localness.” But Lismore Castle, a winding hour-and-a-half drive from Cork, sits in stark .contrast to the empty vistas of the American West. The property dates back to 1185, and some believe its gardens — which will frame several outdoor works by Holt, including “Locator P.S.1.” (1971), a kind of prototype for “Tunnels” — to be the country’s oldest. Also on view will be “Electrical System” (1982), a constellation of 80-plus light bulbs powered by a continuous network of interlocking steel arches that the artist once described as a “fountain of electricity,” and “Boomerang” (1974), a video made in collaboration with the artist Richard Serra, and originally broadcast on live TV. The clip stars a young Nancy Holt, who at one point says, “My mind goes out into the world and then comes back.”  .wear This .At some point during these last few months, I began to despise what I wore every day so much that I fantasized about burning my clothes the moment we all emerge — like butterflies from our cocoons — from lockdown. Instead, I found Baserange, a Parisian brand of basic wear that is a little more elevated and stylish than my old gym clothes and pajamas, but doesn’t sacrifice the comfort and practicality my more hermetic existence now demands. The line .launched in 2012 with foundation garments, including bras without underwire. “We did not want to dictate a certain shape for breasts,” said the co-founders Blandine de Verdelhan and Marie-Louise Mogensen over email. “We felt women were placed in a very limited frame, a frame where there was little movement.” Since then, Baserange has grown to include similarly elegant ready-to-wear pieces, such as dresses, tops, bottoms and much more. All of its clothes are made with natural fibers, including bamboo and organic cotton, as both sustainability and equality are important to the company. The recently launched  . is offered in a new palette of browns and tans intended to echo the diversity of human complexions. And small touches on its classic items, like the wide ribbing on a pair of sweatpants or an artful seam on a turtleneck, have allowed me to venture to an art gallery or an outdoor dinner at a nice restaurant without panicking that I’ve lost all sense of my sartorial self.  .From T’s Instagram",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/t-magazine/calico-wallpaper-portugal-hotel.html
"For Korea’s Golfers Eyeing the Olympics, More Than Four Is a Crowd","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — So Yeon Ryu is a two-time major winner and a former world No. 1 who entered this week’s ANA Inspiration, the first L.P.G.A. major of the year, as a top 20 player. Ryu’s credentials for the Tokyo Olympics this summer are solid gold. .Her passport is her problem. .Ryu is from South Korea, where champion women golfers are an abundant natural resource. With three months until the team rosters for the delayed Summer Games in Tokyo are finalized, Ryu is No. 16 in the world but No. 7 in her homeland. .The Olympic qualification standards dictate that every player in the top 15 is eligible to compete but that no country can have more than four representatives in the 60-player field. Led by Jin Young Ko, Koreans hold the top three spots. .“I don’t know that there’s a harder team in sport to make right now,” said Mike Whan, the departing L.P.G.A. commissioner. .In 2016, when golf returned to the Olympics as a medal sport for the first time since 1904, Ryu missed a berth on the South Korean team despite a top-12 world ranking. .“It’s tougher to make the team from my country than to win the gold medal,” said Ryu, who opened with an even-par 72 Thursday at Mission Hills. Patty Tavatanakit of Thailand shot a six-under-par 66 to lead the field. .South Korean champions have been plentiful over the past decade, capturing 23 of the 47 L.P.G.A. majors contested. They occupy 14 of the top 35 spots in  .. For players desiring to distinguish themselves, making the Olympic team is a priority. .“So many players are playing so well from Korea that I want to say people back home are less appreciative to see what we’re doing on the tour,” said Ryu, 30, whose major titles came at the 2011 United States Women’s Open and the 2017 ANA Inspiration, both in playoffs. “They’re more keen to see the Olympics because they know it’s really, really tough to make the team.” .Inbee Park, Ryu’s best friend and compatriot, won the women’s competition at the Rio Olympics, by five strokes over New Zealand’s Lydia Ko, then the top-ranked player. With the country’s  ., Korean officials were confident of at least one medal in the women’s competition. Park overcame a wrist injury that had slowed her progress all year and delivered on the expectations. .No stranger to the spotlight, she took the golf world on a thrilling ride in 2013 when she  . in a bid to become the first professional, male or female, to win four in the same year. But never, Park said, had she felt more pressure. After arriving in Brazil, Park absorbed the sense of urgency radiated by the archers, the swimmers, the taekwondo athletes and the handball players representing Korea who have one chance every four years to craft their legacies. .“You get so much attention from the people and the country and from everyone pretty much,” Park, now 32 and a seven-time major champion, said this week. “I think it’s double, triple, probably 10 times more pressure than I ever felt in a major championship.” .Whan said the telecast of Park’s final round drew a 27.1 rating in South Korea. To put that in context, he said,  . at the 2013 Women’s British Open — she finished 14 strokes behind the winner, Stacy Lewis — got an 8, which was roughly the same as the rating for Tiger Woods’s victorious final round at the 2019 Masters. .“So imagine Tiger at Augusta times three,” Whan said. “She went from being a really noteworthy golfer to being one of the most famous people in Korea in one weekend.” .Ryu didn’t plan to watch any of the 2016 Olympics coverage. “I was so close to making the team that it definitely hurt for me,” Ryu said. “I wanted to avoid it as much as I can.” .She added, “But when you know your best friend is rocking it in Rio, you have to watch.” .Ryu was glad she saw Park clinch the gold. She credits Park’s performance in the Olympics with her own victory at Mission Hills and ascent to No. 1 the following year. .“Before Rio I was maybe so afraid, ‘What is going to happen if I miss the Olympics?’” Ryu said. “So I almost just wanted to believe winning a major is better than the Olympics.” .She added: “After Inbee won the gold medal, I was definitely jealous — not of her but because I felt she did something that was big for the whole golf industry. Maybe that motivation really helped me to play well in 2017.” .In 2018, South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In a nod to her new stature, Park was chosen as one of the final torch bearers. As she ran with the flame into the Olympic Stadium, slowly to avoid tripping in conditions so cold she could hardly feel her feet, her friend Ryu sat awe-struck in the crowd of 35,000. .After being so near the top 10 and still so far from qualifying for the 2016 Olympics, Ryu recognized it might be her only chance to experience an Olympics up close.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/golf/golf-olympics-women-lpga.html

Frontier Airlines I.P.O. Signals a Travel Industry Recovery,"The pandemic is far from over, but some airlines believe the travel business is already on an upswing. .On Thursday, Frontier Airlines, a budget carrier that is based in Denver and known for putting images of wild animal on its planes, became the second airline this year to list its shares on a stock exchange. Before trading began, Frontier said it expected to raise $266 million by selling 15 million shares at $19 each on Nasdaq under the symbol ULCC, a nod to its strategy as an “ultra-low-cost carrier.” Another 15 million shares will be sold by Frontier’s existing stockholders. .The industry may be struggling through one of the worst crises in its history, but travel is starting to recover and carriers like Frontier and Sun Country Airlines, which finished an initial public offering in mid-March, say they are well positioned for the rebound. Unlike the largest airlines, budget carriers don’t rely on corporate or international travel, which are not expected to bounce back any time soon. Frontier and Sun Country offer domestic flights to passengers visiting family or friends or going on leisure trips, the kind who have been leading the recovery. .“The time is now,” Barry Biffle, the airline’s president and chief executive, said in an interview. “If you look, the vaccine is unlocking the demand, and you’re seeing it everywhere. You’re seeing it in restaurants, you’re seeing it in hotels.” .Many investors seem to agree. Sun Country’s stock price jumped more than 40 percent when it hit the market a couple of weeks ago. Shares of established airlines have also rallied in recent months. Shares in Frontier, which has a $4 billion market capitalization, closed down less than 1 percent on Thursday. .Some optimism may be warranted. For three weeks now, well over one million people have been screened each day at airport checkpoints, according to Transportation Security Administration data, a sign that travel is rebounding. .“We can see that light at the end of the tunnel,” Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines,  .. “Domestic leisure demand has almost entirely recovered. It tells you something about the pent-up desire for travel, the pent-up desire to remake those connections with people.” .Frontier, the last of the nation’s 10 largest airlines to go public, said it planned to use the money it raised to buy equipment, invest in sales and marketing, repay debt and shore up its cash reserves. The offering is expected to close on April 6. .The airline’s business model may be well suited for a recovery, but risks abound. The recovery could be derailed if the Covid-19 vaccines prove ineffective at providing long-term protection or if they fail to shield people from new coronavirus variants. .A spike in jet fuel prices, which account for about a quarter of Frontier’s costs, could hinder its ability to keep fares low. And competition will probably be fierce in the years ahead. Discount companies will be up against one another as well as the four big airlines — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United and Southwest Airlines, which have vast resources and are eager to make up lost revenue. .Still, the initial public offering marks an impressive turnaround for Frontier, which sought bankruptcy protection in 2008 during the financial crisis. The airline had struggled with high fuel costs and intense competition from United and Southwest at the Denver airport. Frontier emerged from restructuring a year later and was acquired in 2013 by an affiliate of Indigo Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in ultra-low-cost airlines. Indigo has previously invested in and advised Spirit Airlines, Tigerair in Singapore, Volaris in Mexico and Wizz Air in Europe. .Like those companies, Frontier focuses intently on keeping costs low and passing those savings onto customers, sometimes offering fares so cheap that they can attract customers who weren’t otherwise planning to travel. .“They’re not in the same business as American, Delta and United,” said Michael Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, an aviation consulting and forecasting firm in Evergreen, Colo. “When they go into a market, their main competitor is Home Depot. They’re after getting savings out of the bank account.” .Under Indigo’s ownership, Frontier installed a new management team, including Mr. Biffle, and sharply cut costs by renegotiating contracts and outsourcing its call center, lost baggage services, catering and other functions. The airline found ways to use its planes on more flights and switched to bigger planes with seats packed closer together. The airline has 104 Airbus A320 planes in its relatively young fleet, and plans to add 156 more by the end of 2028. .In a securities filing, Frontier said it believed that it could lure millions of passengers over the coming decade. The airline expects demand to rise for short domestic trips as more people choose to work remotely. It believes it could profitably add as many as 518 routes between airports that it already uses but that are not currently served by an ultra-low-cost carrier. .“We just believe we’ve got more embedded growth, we’ve also got lower costs, and we believe we’ve got a great brand that positions us well in the low-fare space,” Mr. Biffle said. .The airline claims it is unique among low-cost airlines. While Spirit tends to serve more-crowded markets and Allegiant Air less-crowded ones, Frontier is more evenly distributed. The airline said it kept planes moving for more hours every day than most other major airlines and offers some flights only a few days a week, allowing it to serve smaller cities. In addition to Denver, Frontier has a big presence in Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas. .Frontier also claims to be more fuel-efficient than its peers, which it hopes will appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. .The airline earned $251 million in 2019 before losing nearly as much last year. It has about $1 billion in cash or cash equivalents and employs about 5,000 people. .Deregulation of the U.S. airline industry in 1978 paved the way for the growth of low-cost carriers, which tend to operate direct, point-to-point flights, often to secondary airports in major cities — an approach pioneered by Southwest. That strategy makes it easier to put planes and crews to efficient use, allowing the airlines to offer relatively low fares. The more traditional hub-and-spoke model used by American, United and Delta is more expensive to maintain but easier to grow once established. .The ultra-low-cost model is a more recent creation, one that Europe’s Ryanair is often credited with popularizing. Companies that use it are much more aggressive about keeping costs low and maximizing revenue. These airlines tend to use their planes an hour or two more each day than other airlines and tend to cram more and smaller seats into planes. They also charge for lots of services that even many conventional discount airlines include in the ticket price, such as seat selection or printed boarding passes. .But larger airlines are unlikely to easily cede ground to Frontier and its ilk. In March, for example, United, which operates the most flights at the Denver airport, announced plans to add dozens of nonstop flights between small Midwestern cities and a handful of tourist destinations. Even before the pandemic, United and other large airlines were copying ultra-low-cost companies by offering lower fares and charging for more services.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/business/frontier-airlines-ipo.html

House Hunting in England: Nestled in a London Viaduct for $1.3 Million,"This arched two-bedroom, two-bath house is built below and beside an active 19th-century railway viaduct in South London. The open-plan home, covering 1,600 square feet, is wrapped in a rust-colored steel shell and brings in light through a slender three-story atrium. .The front door, clad in palm wood and topped with a square window, sits in an underpass below the viaduct. A two-door entrance hall acts as a physical and acoustic buffer between inside and outside, said Didier Ryan, the architect, who designed the home for his brother, completing it in 2012. .“When you come through the second door, it opens up into the vast, cavernous space of the arch,” Mr. Ryan said. “It’s such a big scale change that it’s an amazing surprise for people to come through that space.” .He added, “London a good percentage of the time has very gray skies, but in that space it’s perpetually very softly well lit.” .To prevent noise and vibrations from the passing trains above, the house was set on an elevated rubber foundation and constructed with layered materials — including its industrial steel shell — and cavities that act as sound buffers, much like double-pane windows. .Both ends of the ground floor — which is large enough for several groupings of furniture, including two long kitchen tables — are framed by a wide arch. On one side, near the entrance, a staircase leads to a small mezzanine with a built-in bookcase and enough room for a children’s playroom or office. Beneath it, behind a door, is the laundry room. .On the opposite side, where the ceiling opens up into the soaring atrium, is the kitchen, with an island and cabinetry that curves with the wall. Countertops, like the built-in bookshelf and the mezzanine stairs across the way, are reclaimed iroko wood. A tall wood-framed kitchen window looks out to some planted greenery. .A bedroom is to one side of the kitchen, and a bathroom with a cavelike, mosaic-tiled shower is on the other. A spiral staircase leads up to another mezzanine with the second bedroom on one end and a bathroom on the other. In between, a white staircase ascends to the top level, which has been used as a study and offers skylight views. .The home is situated in London’s Walworth neighborhood, steps from the 140-acre Burgess Park and from the South Bank area, home to several arts venues and a riverside walkway. Two London Underground stations are within a mile of the house. Heathrow Airport is about an hour by car, or 75 minutes by public transit. .Britain’s housing market had a surprisingly robust 2020 despite the country’s  .. Even with a slight slowdown in January owing largely to a winter surge of coronavirus infections, the momentum has continued in 2021 thanks to low interest rates, the extension of government housing and job support, and the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, not to mention continued demand for larger homes and more outdoor space. .“I think the light at the end of the tunnel is certainly a great driver at the moment, and that’s another reason I think that the market is going to be very busy past Easter,” said James Klonaris, head of appraisals at The Modern House brokerage, which has this listing. “I think it’s all a question of staving off joblessness. If we can do that, I think the market will continue. And the pandemic has taught us that our living environments are hugely important.” .The Modern House ended 2020 with “probably the busiest market since 2015,” Mr. Klonaris said. A sales adviser at the brokerage, Jack Blythman, noted that the company has seen a 150 percent increase in website users since the start of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. .After an eight-week pause during Britain’s first lockdown last spring, the market picked up quickly and barreled into Christmas. .“I don’t think any of us expected to come out the other side with such a strong market,” said Jonathan Hewlett, head of London residential at Savills. The global property firm reported a 10 percent growth in its British residential revenues from midyear 2020. .According to a  . (ONS), Britain saw its largest rate of annual house price growth since October 2014, with average house prices rising by 8.5 percent during the year and settling at a record high of 252,000 pounds ($347,000). The office’s  . showed the average at 249,000 pounds ($343,000), with prices also up in Wales (+9.6 percent), Scotland (+6.9 percent) and Northern Ireland (+5.3 percent). .London remained the most expensive area in Britain, with an average home price of 501,000 pounds ($691,000). .The December ONS report noted a “range of factors” for the increases, including reduced inventory, pent-up demand, shifting housing preferences amid the pandemic, and changes made to property transaction taxes. In July, the government placed the stamp duty land tax, a transaction tax paid on property purchases, on “holiday” through March 31, 2021. It has since been extended through June. .“We saw, obviously, the fairly well-established pattern now of people searching for more greenery and more space after the lockdown,” said Tom Bill, head of U.K. residential research at the property firm Knight Frank. “That certainly drove demand and drove activity to outer areas of London, the suburbs and also into the country.” .In prime central London, Savills also reported robust activity at the “absolute top end” of the market, Mr. Hewlett said. .Agents agreed that the greatest demand has been for large family houses with offices and outdoor space. However, travel restrictions prolonged by Britain’s spike in Covid-19 infections over the winter have forced foreign buyers out of the picture for the most part. .“Even with travel restrictions and very, very few international purchasers being in London, some international investors are certainly looking at buying off-plan units in new schemes,” Mr. Hewlett said, noting that the looming introduction of a 2 percent surcharge for overseas buyers on purchases of residential property is hastening activity. .Still, uncertainty over when foreign buyers will return to London is tamping down optimism for 2021, Mr. Bill said. “It might take a period of time to adjust,” he said, “so we’ve just reduced our forecast down for this year. We actually bumped it up a little bit for next year. We think demand is going to be probably displaced more into 2022.” .The hope is that the country is “on the verge of a sort of return to normality,” he said. “I think because the Covid cases are falling, because the vaccine program in the U.K. has been, relatively speaking, a success, because there is the prospect of summer holidays, I think what is happening now, we are starting to see supply come back in. And I think supply and demand are both, frankly, just getting stronger and stronger.” .Travel restrictions have altered the market’s demographics in Britain. “Usually we have quite a lot of American or European buyers, but that’s been less the case, unless they are domiciled,” Mr. Klonaris said. .In 2020, French buyers were the most prominent foreign presence in the central London market, “because they could get here more easily,” Mr. Bill said, noting that “Italians were fairly active as well.” .Before the pandemic, Chinese buyers dominated in prime Central London, followed by buyers from the U.S., Russia, India, Hong Kong and the Middle East. .There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in England. Buyers and sellers use their own lawyers, and the seller pays the agent’s commissions, which is 2 to 3 percent. .If the property is a second home, a 3 percent surcharge is added. This is in addition to the 2 percent stamp duty surcharge for overseas buyers, which is slated to be introduced April 1. .“We believe there are still plenty of international purchasers out there wanting to live/invest in London, and many genuinely believe that they are buying as close to the bottom of the market as you can,” Mr. Hewlett said. “Especially as buyers are getting a discount of circa 20 percent from the peak in 2014.” .This property is for sale on a leasehold.

Tiger Woods Update: Sheriff Says Crash Investigation Is Done,"The investigation into Tiger Woods’s single-vehicle crash in February is finished, but the results cannot be released publicly until Woods gives permission, the Los Angeles County sheriff said in a Facebook Livestream on Wednesday. .“A cause has been determined,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva said, adding: “We have all the contents of the black box. We’ve got everything completed, signed, sealed and delivered. However, we can’t release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision.” .Woods, 45, sustained severe injuries to his right leg on Feb. 23, requiring at least two operations after the S.U.V. he was driving crashed onto a hillside along a tricky stretch of road in Los Angeles County. No one but Woods, the pre-eminent figure in golf over the past quarter-century, was involved, according to the authorities. .The sheriff has maintained that the crash was an accident, saying that he and his deputies did not detect signs of impairment at the scene that day. However, he said about a week later that investigators had gotten a search warrant for the event data recorder, also known as a black box, in Woods’s S.U.V. to help clarify the cause of the crash. .“It’s still an accident,” he said Wednesday. “You have an accident, and you have deliberate acts. It’s an accident, OK. We’re reaching out to Tiger Woods to be able to release the report itself, and nothing has changed from what we know and what we learned throughout the course of the investigation. And everything we did turned out to be accurate.” .Woods’s longtime agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. .Here is what we know as of Wednesday night. .Woods was released last month from a Los Angeles hospital where he was treated after the crash, according to a post to his Twitter account on March 16 that said he was at home. .“I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day,” the Twitter post on Tuesday read. .Woods’s only known residence is in Jupiter Island, Fla., where he lives in a mansion — sometimes with his two children, custody of whom he shares with his ex-wife. .The post did not contain updates on his condition, and Steinberg, Woods’s agent, said in an email that he could not offer any further information on his client’s location or condition. .Woods was taken to Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles on the day of the crash and underwent emergency surgery to repair serious injuries to his right leg. .He was  . Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of Feb. 25. .The morning after Woods’s arrival at Cedars-Sinai, he received “follow-up procedures on his injuries,” which were deemed successful, according to a statement from Woods’s Twitter account. .Dr. Anish Mahajan, the acting chief executive of Harbor-U.C.L.A., said  . the night after the crash that both bones in Woods’s lower right leg, the tibia and the fibula, had been broken in multiple places and were “open fractures,” meaning the bones had pierced his skin. .Dr. Mahajan said doctors had “stabilized” the breaks by placing a rod in the tibia. He said that additional bones in Woods’s ankle and foot had also been injured and that they had been “stabilized with a combination of screws and pins.” .The statement did not describe any injuries to Woods’s left leg, though Daryl L. Osby, the Los Angeles County fire chief, had said earlier that Woods had “serious injuries” to both legs. The chief did not explain further and said he was not sure what other injuries Woods might have sustained. .Doctors not involved in Woods’s care have predicted an  . from his injuries. .The warrant to inspect the black box’s data was executed on March 1 as part of a “routine procedure,” a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department said last month. .When asked why the department had not sought a warrant for blood samples from the hospital, which would indicate whether Woods had alcohol or drugs in his system, Sheriff Villanueva said in a livestream on March 3 that there was no evidence of impairment. .“Absent the evidence of impairment, you know, you’re not going to get a search warrant,” the sheriff said. “Period. It’s not getting assigned by the judge.” .Though the investigation continued, Sheriff Villanueva was quite clear at a news conference on Feb. 24 that he believed the crash was accidental. “We don’t contemplate any charges whatsoever in this crash,” he said. “This remains an accident, and an accident is not a crime.” .Drug recognition experts — police officers trained to identify people suspected of being impaired — were not dispatched to either the site of the crash or the hospital, Sheriff Villanueva added. .Although Woods appeared “lucid and calm” immediately after the accident and was able to answer questions from Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, the first emergency responder to arrive at the scene, he “had no recollection of the crash itself” when asked at the hospital, Villanueva said in a Feb. 24  .. .Forensic experts from across the country who are not involved in the investigation told USA Today, for an  . published on March 13, that it appeared to be either a case of falling asleep at the wheel or of impaired or distracted driving. .The crash occurred on Hawthorne Boulevard near Rancho Palos Verdes, a coastal city of about 42,000 people in Los Angeles County. .According to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department, there were 13 accidents, four with injuries, from Jan. 3, 2020, to Feb. 23 of this year within a 1.35-mile stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard that includes the site where Woods crashed, according to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department. .Only one of those accidents was officially determined to have involved a person under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to the data, and none involved someone using a phone. Two of the 13 accidents were single-vehicle crashes, and the data indicated that neither driver in those cases had been driving under the influence. .The speed limit there is 45 miles per hour, but Deputy Gonzalez said he had sometimes seen vehicles going more than 80 miles per hour. Sheriff Villanueva said it appeared that Woods had been driving at a “greater speed than normal” on the day of the accident. .Officers arrived at the scene six minutes after receiving a 911 call and found Woods trapped in an S.U.V. that had rolled over, Sheriff Villanueva said on the day of the crash. .The vehicle Woods was driving hit the median strip, traveled several hundred feet and rolled several times before stopping in the brush on the other side of the road, Sheriff Villanueva said. There were no skid or swerve marks, indicating that Woods had made no attempt to brake, the sheriff said. The bumper and the front end of the car were “destroyed,” but the interior cabin of the vehicle was “more or less intact,” he added. .There was no evidence that Woods was being followed or looking at his phone, the sheriff said at the time of the crash. Weather was also not a factor in the crash, he said. Woods was wearing his seatbelt, and airbags in the car deployed, Deputy Gonzalez said. .Woods was in Southern California to host, but not to compete in, the Genesis Invitational at the Riviera Country Club in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles the weekend before the crash. Genesis Motor is a luxury vehicle division of Hyundai. Woods was in a 2021 Genesis GV80 S.U.V., which was provided to him during the tournament; he is  . in a courtesy car at tournaments. .Woods stayed after the weekend to do  ., and when the crash happened, according to ESPN, he was on his way to a photo shoot with the N.F.L. quarterbacks Drew Brees and Justin Herbert. .Rory McIlroy, 31, in an  .” with Jimmy Fallon on March 9, said that he had spoken with Woods and that he expected him to be able to recover at home with his family soon. .“He’s doing better — and I think all of us are wishing him a speedy recovery at this point,” McIlroy said of himself and unspecified fellow golfers in the interview, which he did from the Players Championship. .Several PGA Tour players  ., on the final day of the Workday Championship on Feb. 28.

On Sunday, he said he was “feeling fine, a little bit stiff,” and was awaiting another magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate his progress. .In the meantime, he said, he was “still doing the mundane stuff that you have to do for rehab, the little things before you can start gravitating toward something a little more.” .Woods tied for 38th place in the 2020 Masters, which was played in November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The T List: Five Things We Recommend This Week,"visit This .Friday will see the opening of a new kind of general store in downtown New York, one informed by nostalgia and empathy as much as function. The fashion stylist Beverly Nguyen’s first foray into retail, the two-month pop-up shop Beverly’s NYC, will offer a tightly edited, affordable selection of household essentials — including the perfect martini glass, pepper mill and cast-iron pan, as well as olive oil she produced in collaboration with a family-owned company in Santa Ynez, Calif. — in a Chinatown space that conjures the same feelings of warmth and intimacy as the dinner parties that, before the pandemic, she threw regularly at her Manhattan apartment. The interior was a collaboration between Nguyen and two of her close friends, the architect Louis Rambert, known for his work with the firm  ., and the film producer Kelly McGee (Nguyen’s partner in the project), and .features floral wallpaper by the New York-based  ., as well as a custom kidney-shaped ceramic cash wrap by Fefo Studio in Brooklyn. But Nguyen’s biggest influence was perhaps her grandmother, who owned a hardware store in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, in the 1960s; it was only after praying to her spirit, when a previous location fell through, that Nguyen secured the venue. Her family is also represented in a line of simple, supersoft towels and table linens that Nguyen developed with her parents, Vietnamese immigrants who began manufacturing apparel after arriving in the States as refugees in the 1980s. She hopes the space, which was previously a Chinese temple, will feel equally welcoming to her Chinese neighbors, many of whom have lived in the neighborhood for decades, and to newcomers to the city looking to make a home here. As she sees it, “the shop is really for anyone who wants to build their own conversation and their own community.”  .eat This .For anyone wanting .to eat more sustainably and mindfully, the discovery of Pyscis, a gourmet tinned-fish company from Vienna, will be a welcome .one. Created by Marwan Saba, the .owner of Hans Reh, a local grocer that specializes in fish conserves, and his daughter, Song-I Saba, Pyscis sells seasonal pelagic fish responsibly sourced from Spanish waters and packaged in limited quantities. Its .offerings include blue mussels, bullet tuna and two types of sardines, each tinned in a high-quality olive oil specifically chosen to pair well .with the fish. “None of the subspecies we use have been overfished,” Song-I explains of the brand’s sustainability efforts. “These fish, like with the bullet tuna, .are lesser known in the industry, but they’re actually healthier: Because they’re younger, they don’t accumulate as many toxins.” Each tin comes wrapped in white parchment paper adorned with a drawing of the fish inside and held together by a natural-rubber band. While methods of preserving nonrefrigerated foods have remained largely unchanged since 1809, when Napoleon awarded .Nicolas Appert — known as the Father of Canning — 12,000 francs for winning a contest to find the best method of storing rations for his troops, Pyscis’s subtle touches are what make each tin .uniquely delicious. On a recent cold .night, I rolled back the lids on the sardines, the hand-shucked mussels and the tuna. I made a quick salad, softened some butter and ripped apart some good bread. I wasn’t feeding an army, but as I assembled tartine after tartine, I felt my resolve .return — at least for the evening.  .see This .In the folklore of suburban girlhood, the mall persists as a symbol of freedom and fantasy. Or so believes the multimedia artist  ., whose latest installation, “Daytime Sparkles,” debuts at  . this week in partnership with the Whitney .Museum’s emerging artists program. Lee, who grew up visiting her mother after school at the New Jersey department store where she worked, describes her time in these spaces as being dominated by pop music, ever-changing displays and shop-specific fragrances. For her installation, she drew on those memories, as well as her own Y2K .girl-power style and the 1996 .DJ Screw mixtape “Ballin in da Mall,” to create a piece that speaks to .teenage self-discovery and independence. Located on the fifth floor of Nordstrom’s New York flagship, on West 57th Street, the work includes two rust-colored couches that frame a low table, within which Lee has stored a range of Nordstrom merchandise, and atop which sit two analog televisions playing D.I.Y.-style commercials .that the artist filmed herself. The high white walls that surround the scene are adorned with sparkling shapes, colorful LED-lit windows, “No Loitering” signs and a massive projection of a candelabra dripping in necklaces, while a custom pop song that Lee created in collaboration with the composer and artist Stefan Tcherepnin .plays in the background. Shoppers are meant to engage with the installation — to recline on the sofas, bop their heads to the music — becoming one with the artwork and .showcasing precisely what Lee is nostalgic for: a public gathering place, where the younger versions of ourselves can run free.  .wear This .Born in the Mexican state of Jalisco, the artist  . left for California in 1925 to work on the railroads and in the mines. When the Great Depression hit, Ramírez, who didn’t speak English, found himself without a job or housing, and was picked up by the police and admitted against his will to a state hospital; he was eventually diagnosed with .catatonic schizophrenia. He would spend the last 30 years of his life in psychiatric facilities, where he kept to himself but produced a body of drawings that incorporated images of Catholic saints, cowboys and train tracks, as well as complex geometries. Since his death in 1963, he’s been widely recognized as a self-taught master and has been made the subject of various major museum shows. Now, he’s being celebrated by the French fashion label Lemaire, which, having partnered with the artist’s estate, sent cotton-linen, dry silk and cotton voile garments printed with Ramírez’s work down the (virtual) runway last fall. Sarah-Linh Tran, the co-creative director of the house, says that the artist’s tragic story resonates with our time, but it isn’t what she sees first: “What’s striking is that he had the power to transcend isolation and create an intimate topography.” And surely the works’ earthy tones and precise draftsmanship were a natural fit for Lemaire’s aesthetic. The brand honored the latter by eschewing a copy-and-paste approach and instead allowing Ramírez’s vivid line work to inform the silhouette of each piece, as with a shirt with an askew button that seems to create a step for the subjects of “Horse and Rider” (1953), heightening the sense that they are on the move. Tran’s favorite design is a parachute dress emblazoned with a Mexican Madonna. “It’s as though she’s playing hide-and-seek around the wearer’s body,” she says.  .Try This ., a Philadelphia-based creative studio founded in 2012 by Paul Farber and Ken Lum to facilitate the community’s engagement with public art through exhibitions and research initiatives, recently launched a free augmented reality app: OverTime. Developed in collaboration with the production company .Dream Syndicate and supported by the Knight Foundation, the software allows users to embark on free historical tours of the city. The app’s inaugural journey begins on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and is led by the local poet and activist Ursula Rucker. Scan the ground with your smart device and Rucker appears onscreen, welcoming you to Philadelphia. From there, users choose from three different tour options: There’s the virtual Living Timeline, which moves users from 10,000 years before the Common Era to 2021; City Sightlines, which maps Philadelphia’s development from an early “green country town” to a thriving city; and Statue Stories, which delves into the history of the Rocky Balboa statue and other memorialized figures. Each route enables participants to explore the hidden narratives underfoot, like the fact that the museum’s steps — and part of the building itself — were designed by the African-American architect Julian Abele in the early 20th century, or that before the arrival of William Penn in 1682, the land was inhabited by the Lenape, the Indigenous people of the area. Throughout the tour, Rucker asks users to answer three questions: “What has happened here? What can you see from here? What does this statue mean to you?” Submitted through the app, the responses become, according to Farber and Lum, part of the city’s collective memory. It’s a gesture Rucker herself agrees with: “Should we even call them monuments anymore?” she says of public statues and institutions. “All of our memories matter. We are our own monuments.”  .From T’s Instagram",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/t-magazine/maggie-lee-nordstrom.html
,"A year into the pandemic, it’s easy to find yourself reminiscing about the past: bustling restaurants, sweaty spin classes, grocery shopping unburdened by face masks and cascades of adrenaline. You may even miss things you never thought you would, like your annoying co-workers or your long commute. .Yes, this is the definition of “taking things for granted” — so perhaps it’s not surprising that we’re all suddenly appreciating what’s no longer available. But it’s also evidence of a cognitive tendency we share to selectively remember the past as better than it was, especially when the present doesn’t feel so good. .As we look back on “the good old days,” we need to ask ourselves: Was the past actually as great as we remember it? And what can we learn from all these walks down memory lane? .Not exactly. But there’s a common misconception that memories are accurate records of the past, pristinely preserved in a mental filing cabinet. .“Memory doesn’t really work like that,” said Anne Wilson, a professor of psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University whose research broadly focuses on memory, time and identity. “We reconstruct what happened in the past on the basis of little bits and pieces of memory. We’re acting like archaeologists — picking up the pieces and putting them back together.” .This doesn’t mean we consciously distort or embellish our memories. But the process of retrieving memories is “highly reconstructive and prone to various biases,” said Daniel Schacter, a professor of psychology at Harvard University and the author of “The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers.” .For instance, researchers have observed that memories associated with negative emotions fade more quickly than those associated with positive emotions. This phenomenon is known as fading affect bias. .“It’s a coping mechanism,” said Felipe de Brigard, a professor of philosophy, psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, who studies the intersection of memory and imagination. “You have to carry your past with you. If a memory hurt every time that you recalled it as much as when you experienced it, that would be unbearable.” . found a correlation between fading affect bias and perseverance, suggesting that diminished negativity allows people “to put positive and negative events into the proper emotional perspective.” .Then there’s the simple fact that most of us prefer reminiscing about positive experiences, which gives us “preferential access” to those memories, Dr. Schacter explained. In other words, aspects of the past that we enjoy thinking about tend to stick with us over time, while elements we don’t think about fade away. Researchers call this  .. “This may contribute to a positive memory bias because we tend not to rehearse, rehash and retrieve negative experiences,” Dr. Schacter added. Traumatic memories, which are often intrusive and persistent, are the notable exception. .Our general tendency to recall positive memories over negative ones is especially pronounced when we feel discomfort in the present. That’s because the process of recalling the past is always dictated by “the perspective that we’re coming in with and the questions we’re asking about the past,” Dr. Wilson said. She called this our “current lens.” .Your current lens acts as a kind of filter, determining what details you dredge up and what you make of them. Living amid a deadly pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we’re all primed with some degree of collective nostalgia as a baseline. “If we start out with the hypothesis that things were better in the past, then we’ll pull out memories to confirm that,” Dr. Wilson said. .Part of this has to do with what researchers call “mood repair” — doing what we can to lift ourselves up when we’re feeling down. “Memory isn’t just there to help us remember where the car is parked,” Dr. de Brigard said. “It also plays other roles, and one of them is to help us feel better.” .None of this is incidental — autobiographical memory has evolved this way for good reason. .In her  ., Dr. Wilson found that we manipulate our personal memories to create a coherent identity and favorable sense of self over time. .This may mean embellishing our memories with imaginative elements, or omitting details we’d rather not dwell on. “We know that memory and imagination interact enormously,” Dr. de Brigard said. “We often imagine ways in which the past could’ve happened. Then our imagination penetrates the original memory and modifies the content.” .While the malleable quality of our memory makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and error, it’s also a real adaptation of the human mind. “Recalling past positive events is an adaptive way to regulate emotion in the present and enhance optimism about the future,” Dr. Schacter said. .In fact,  . has shown that, on both neural and cognitive levels, the same regions of the brain come online when we remember the past as when we imagine the future. .It makes sense. To plan for the future, we have to look to the past. In less-than-ideal times, we may recruit positive memories in order to envision the future with greater hope, motivation and resilience. .No, chatting by the water cooler with colleagues may not have felt that extraordinary at the time. But glorifying experiences like these in our current moment may actually serve a purpose. Who among us doesn’t need a boost these days? .Just because memories  . change when we reconstruct them doesn’t necessarily mean all of them  . changed significantly. But it does mean that they are still all shaped by various cognitive processes, including those meaningful moments, like holiday gatherings or trips. .We’ve all felt it: The family vacation was full of arguments, sunburns and hangovers, but somehow you remember only the quality time, gorgeous weather and delicious meals. ., two psychology researchers, Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson, sought to offer and test a theoretical model for this phenomenon, which they called “rosy retrospection.” In their paper, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Thompson explained rosy retrospection as one of three ways our mind creates the effect of “rose-colored glasses.” First is rosy projection — the “great, positive anticipation” that often leads to “overblown expectations,” said Dr. Thompson, a professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. .Second, the researchers said, is the “dampening” of pleasure in the present: “We are hard-wired to give negative stimuli a lot more cognitive attention in the present,” Dr. Thompson said. But these details “disappear by the wayside in our memories.” The result? Rosy retrospection: recalling the past more fondly than we experienced it at the time. .Multiple studies document rosy retrospection in action. A  . found that visitors to Disneyland reported significantly more positive recollections of their trips than the details they reported during the trips themselves (like crying children or long lines). “We are hard-wired to give negative stimuli a lot more cognitive attention in the present,” Dr. Thompson said. ., Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Thompson found similar results when they put their theory of rosy retrospection to work, examining participants’ anticipation of, experiences in and recollections of a trip to Europe, a Thanksgiving vacation and a three-week cycling trip in California. Across the board, reported recollections were far more positive than experiences recorded in the present. .Put simply, we’ll always grab onto the details that confirm our current lens (“What a great vacation that was!”) and stitch together our memories accordingly. .“Part of this is driven by self-enhancement: ‘I want to think of myself as a lucky, fortunate, probably somewhat talented, capable person,’” .said Dr. Thompson. “We construct a story after the fact and selectively choose the things that were romantic.” .There is no glaring problem with romanticizing the past. As long as we’re aware how memory works, we can keep ourselves accountable, try to learn from the past and live more fully in the present. .But particularly during challenging moments of life, there are real benefits to taking a step back from whatever is going on in the present. .“We have the ability to get some space from our own experiences, which can be really useful for helping us think about them more objectively,” said Ethan Kross, a psychologist and the director of the University of Michigan Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory. .Dr. Kross has dedicated much of his research to studying what he’s called “self-distancing” — “the ability to step outside yourself and view yourself from a more distanced perspective, similar to how we might think of another person.” .He added: “There are lots of ways you can gain distance from your experiences. The act of thinking about the past is one way.” .Looking back at the past, romanticized or not, “allows us to get a broader sense of perspective, which can help people make sense of their experience,” he said. .A  . found that “temporal distancing” (or, thinking about ourselves in the past or future) enhances our ability to cope with negative events by helping us realize their impermanence: “This too shall pass,” an idea we’re better prepared to believe when we see the proverbial bigger picture. .Self-distancing has also been shown to  . and  ., support  ., and  . and  ., among other benefits. .Spending time with glorified memories in particular may also have  .. .“Nostalgia is an important psychological resource,” Dr. Wilson said. “People can dip into the past, especially when the present is not sustaining them.” . backs this up. Reaching for nostalgia has been shown to  . and  .. Research by Xinyue Zhou of Sun Yat-Sen University in southern China has shown that nostalgia not only has psychological benefits, but potentially also physiological ones. In  ., Dr. Zhou found that people experienced nostalgia more readily on cold days or in cold rooms; in addition, participants who engaged with nostalgic memories reported feeling warmer. .If nostalgia “warms” not only our hearts but also our bodies in the face of difficult conditions, then thinking fondly about the past may have evolutionary utility beyond emotional comfort. .The question, then, isn’t how do we appreciate the past less — but how do we learn to appreciate the present more? .Because of the pandemic, we now have evidence that we get nostalgic about even the most boring aspects of life. So, flip your mind’s own logic on its head, and consider what elements of your present situation, however dull and repetitive, you’ll reminisce about once all this is over. .Maybe it’s the bread you learned to make — and the ritual of making it. Perhaps it’s spending more time at home with your children. Allow yourself to really notice the details about these experiences in order to give more texture to your future memories. “Try to become nostalgic for the present,” Dr. de Brigard said. “Help your future self by making the present more memorable. Embellish the dullness.” .It may help to snap a few photos and make your seemingly mundane moments into memories worth keeping and revisiting. By thinking about your present experience in terms of its memory-potential, you may even find yourself paying more attention to the rosier moments rather than those “dampening” distractions. “I guarantee you won’t photograph your dog who keeps soiling the carpet, but you will photograph the perfect croque-madame that you have perfected during lockdown,” Dr. Thompson said. .It seems as if everywhere we look, we’re told to “be present.” It’s valid advice: Doing things like meditating or going for a walk can help us connect more directly to our experience and let go of mental chatter. .But immersing ourselves in the present isn’t the only way to appreciate life more. In fact, embracing our capacity to think about the past and future can help us develop a healthier perspective and find more meaning in the present. .“We’re constantly trying to make meaning out of our experiences, and our mind is flexibly constructed to help us do so,” Dr. Kross said. “I wouldn’t want to give up this ability to go back in time to make sense of what I’m experiencing and then create a story that propels me forward.” .So, take a step back from the nitty-gritty details of your life right now and consider how this period might fit into your “life story.” It will feel cliché, but giving yourself a bit of distance from the day-to-day will help you see yourself more clearly — and with greater compassion. Imagine yourself in the future thinking back on this time. What’s the story you will tell? What did you learn? How did you grow? .Before the pandemic, we gathered with friends, went to bars, saw live music and didn’t think anything of it. Now, you might notice yourself savoring small pleasures a bit more, especially if those things weren’t available during the earlier months of the pandemic. .It’s not a coincidence:  . have shown that when we have less, we savor more. “It’s an economic principle,” said Jordi Quoidbach, a psychologist and an associate professor of people management and organization at the Escuela Superior de Administración y Dirección de Empresas in Spain. “What is rare tends to be cherished more than what is readily available.” .Even when life returns to normal and the simple pleasure of eating out at a restaurant, for example, becomes available, we can “deprive ourselves of the overabundance of pleasure,” Dr. Quoidbach said. “To prolong the excitement of going back to restaurants even when life gets back to normal, we can make it a treat and decide actively that we’re not going to eat out three times a week, but make Thursday a special night, or even the third Thursday of every month.” .When all else fails, consider the fact that this period of time, like any other, will be susceptible to the infinite distortions of memory. Your hair may be gray and your anxiety may be through the roof, but you can imagine the story you’ll rewrite when it comes time to romanticize the past once again.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/smarter-living/why-we-romanticize-the-past.html

The plan, for instance, proposes an extra $115 billion to modernize bridges, highways and roads that are in “most critical need of repair.” But other projects, such as levee systems, are not explicitly mentioned, and it is unclear how they might factor into the proposal. .We took a look at seven examples of urgent infrastructure vulnerabilities across the country, ranging from specific projects to broader problems. .Connecting New York City to New Jersey .The 111-year-old tunnels used by commuter trains and Amtrak have deteriorated rapidly since Hurricane Sandy flooded them with salt water in 2012. .Officials in New York and New Jersey have beseeched federal officials for years to help build new tunnels, arguing that the failure of one could have a devastating economic impact far beyond the region. The Trump administration resisted their appeals. Riders have been  ., with similar problems affecting railways along the Northeast Corridor. .Passenger railways across the country have struggled with a lack of federal funding, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers report card, creating a repair backlog of $45.2 billion. The Biden administration says its plan would replace buses and rail cars and expand transit and rail into new communities; it is unclear how the Hudson River tunnels might be involved. .Crossing the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Ky. .President Barack Obama stood at the base of this bridge in 2011, describing legislation that would help improve it. In 2016, President Donald J. Trump also made assurances to replace the structure. .Yet the  .. Rusty and creaky, it has been listed as “functionally obsolete” in the federal bridge inventory since the 1990s, and it has a history of bottlenecks and crashes. .There is a $2.5 billion plan to fix the bridge and build a new one alongside it, but in Covington, Ky., some have expressed worries about the proposal. The mayor  . that it was an “existential threat,” citing the size of the proposed bridge (some traffic would still cross over the old one, as well). .Mr. Biden’s plan vows to fix the nation’s 10 most economically significant bridges but has not specified which ones those are. “If there is any project eligible, this would be it,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader,  . at a news conference on Wednesday. “Hopefully somewhere in the bowels of this multitrillion bill, there’s a solution.” .Puerto Rico .While children around the world have been going to school remotely since the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, many students in Puerto Rico had been out of class months earlier. That was because a school in southern Puerto Rico had crashed to pieces after  .. .The collapse brought attention to the more than 600 schools on the island that shared a “short column” architectural design, which makes them vulnerable to tremors. Teachers and parents were wary of reopening, and the schools with that design risk remain closed. Children who had gone to them are still learning remotely. .In addition, nearly 60 schools were closed after inspections following the earthquakes showed structural deficiencies. About 25 had “persistent” problems that predated the earthquake and its aftershocks, Puerto Rico’s education secretary told The New York Times last year. .Government officials recently acknowledged that in the year the schools were closed for the pandemic, no repairs had been made on any of the hundreds of vulnerable schools. .Across the country .Major bridges that carry tens of thousands of cars and eighteen-wheelers are not the only ones showing their age. So are smaller bridges in rural areas, which have much less traffic but are no less vital to a community’s ability to function. (In Mississippi alone, officials list 355 bridges that have been closed because of their age or dilapidation.) .Under the president’s infrastructure plan, 10,000 of these bridges would be fixed. .Of the nation’s bridges, 71 percent are rural. They make up 79 percent of the bridges rated as poor or structurally unsound, according to Trip, a transportation research nonprofit group. .Advocates for rural communities say the problems with bridges are indicative of a wider lack of connectivity — by roadways and through broadband internet. (The president’s plan also says it will deliver access to reliable high-speed internet to the 35 percent of residents of rural communities without it.) .Rural roads and bridges have a $211 billion backlog in improvements. Some of these projects, such as adding guardrails and widening lanes, could make it safer to drive on rural, noninterstate roads, which account for a disproportionately high number of the country’s traffic deaths. .Jackson, Miss. .Many vulnerabilities in infrastructure were exposed when a powerful winter storm swept through Texas and into the Southeast in February. One of them was the water system in Jackson, Miss., the state capital, where  .. .The water crisis inflamed enduring tensions in Jackson, ones that grip many communities where white residents have fled and tax bases have evaporated. The city has old and broken pipes. It does not have the funding to repair them. City officials estimated that modernizing Jackson’s water infrastructure could cost $2 billion. .The storm also caused power failures for millions of people across Texas, which has prompted lawmakers there to weigh an overhaul of the state’s electric infrastructure. At least  . as a result of the storm, according to state officials, and it also caused widespread property damage and left some residents to face huge electric bills. .Under Mr. Biden’s plan, lead pipes and service lines would be eliminated, and more transmission lines for electricity would be installed. .Michigan and many other states .When Michigan state officials investigated what had led to the collapse of the Edenville and Sanford dams last year, which caused thousands to evacuate and inundated hundreds of homes and businesses, the  .: A historic flooding event had caught up with years of underfunding and neglect. .The country has roughly 91,000 dams, a majority of which are more than 50 years old, and many are an exceptional rainfall away from potential disaster. As dams have aged, the weather  ., rendering old building standards outdated and creating conditions that few considered when many of the dams were built. .Residential development has also steadily spread into once rural areas that lie downstream from the weakening infrastructure. According to the  ., about 15,600 dams in the country would most likely cause death and extensive property damage if they failed. Of those, more than 2,330 are considered deficient, the group said. .While the Biden plan mentions “dam safety,” it gives no details. .Across the country .The country has tens of thousands of miles of levees, which safeguard millions of people and trillions of dollars’ worth of property. .The United States Army Corps of Engineers operates a small fraction of the nation’s levees, while the rest are maintained by a patchwork of levee districts, local governments and private owners. .But floodwaters care little about who is in charge of maintenance, as the catastrophic 2019 floods in the Midwest showed. When record-breaking rains fell, levees were breached or overtopped across the region, drenching farmland, inundating homes and causing billions of dollars in damage. .The rainfall  ., given new weather patterns driven by climate change. And some of the officials whose towns and cities were most affected by the 2019 floods are adamant: Simply refurbishing levees is not going to work anymore. .“Levees aren’t going to do it,” said Colin Wellenkamp, the executive director of Mississippi River Cities & Towns Initiative, an association of 100 mayors along the Mississippi River. His group presented a plan to the White House last month detailing a “systemic solution” to flooding. It includes replacing wetlands, reconnecting backwaters to the main river and opening up areas for natural flooding. .A plan that simply replaces infrastructure, rather than rethinking what it encompasses, will be ineffective and ultimately unaffordable, Mr. Wellenkamp said. He is not sure whether his group’s proposals have been folded into the Biden plan. But he sees little choice. .“This is a losing game unless we incorporate other, larger solutions,” he said. .Campbell Robertson . and  .Frances Robles . contributed reporting.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/infrastructure-projects-joe-biden.html
An Argument for Investing Where the Return Is Social Change,"Advocates for impact investments have long made the case that investments can do social good without sacrificing returns. .And then there are the wealthy philanthropists who give money to nonprofit organizations trying to bring about social change without expecting any financial return. .But there is a middle ground for investors — a little more impact for a little less return. It has been the third rail of socially responsible investing, though, mainly because impact investors fear that such an approach could embolden critics who have long warned that investors will get lower returns if they want to push for change. .Now, a new study by the Bridgespan Group, the philanthropic consulting arm of Bain & Company, argues that this is the moment to put more money, time and energy into a middle ground, which it calls impact-first investing. The  ., “Back to the Frontier: Investing That Puts Impact First,” focuses on investments that consider positive impact first and financial return second. It makes the case for how such investments can boost emerging technologies faster than grants or traditional impact investments. These investments, the report says, can help create new markets. .“It doesn’t have to be just return-seeking or just philanthropy,” said Michael Etzel, co-head of the impact investing practice at Bridgespan and the lead author of the report. “You can use that tool that sits in the middle.” .Mr. Etzel said he saw this approach as a way to speed up getting to a solution by backing new technologies or creating markets that could later support more traditional impact investments. .“Success is about the social and environmental impact you care about and getting to it faster rather than looking at your overall portfolio and net worth,.” he said. .One example of how this would work is the investment strategy of Ceniarth, which is focusing on using its funds to bring about major changes. Ceniarth, with $450 million, was set up by Diane Isenberg, whose wealth derives from Nabors Industries, the oil and gas drilling company created by her father, Eugene. Its impact-first investments are considered high risk without the commensurate rate of return for the risk being taken, though they are still likely to pay back something. .“Our segment is working on livelihoods in marginalized and vulnerable communities globally,” said Greg Neichin, the director of Ceniarth. “We’re trying to improve economic livelihoods by addressing issues of poverty around the world.” .One investment it made was in the One Acre Fund, which provides loans so small farmers in Africa can buy better seed and fertilizer and get agronomic training. .“When we think about the things for us that are successful, it’s a combination of delivering economic benefit to recipients and having the capacity to scale an idea,” Mr. Neichin said. .Credit for devising this middle ground often goes to the Omidyar Network, which the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, created as both a foundation and an impact investment firm. Matt Bannick, its former managing partner, said Mr. Omidyar had been hesitant at first to blur the lines. .Instead, Mr. Bannick said, they focused on creating new markets. One example was d.light, which provided solar-powered lanterns to replace more dangerous kerosene lanterns in Africa. .“We found when we loosened the constraint of financial returns, then the focus became even more about impact,” said Mr. Bannick, who is a co-author of the Bridgespan report. “If you’re getting 5 percent less on the return, then what are you going to get on the impact? Let’s be more explicit about the intended impact here.” .The middle-ground approach is not without critics. .One issue is that while the wealthy can take such risks for a low return, most investors cannot. Nor would investors in many of the typical impact funds be willing to accept lower returns for riskier investments. .Getting a market-rate return is something impact investors are comfortable with, but a lower return makes it harder to attract enough investors, said Trenton Allen, managing director and chief executive of Sustainable Capital Advisors. “It’s not impossible,” he said. “But you’re narrowing the number of investors you have access to.” .Traditional impact investors also argue that accepting different returns for different investments is already happening. Consider bondlike returns for fixed-income types of risk. .“Impact investing is a big tent and should be a big tent,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner at DBL Partners, an impact venture capital fund. “The challenge is, we shouldn’t muddy the waters and think impact-first is the only kind of investment. We also don’t want to step backward and deal with biases about returns that we have spent at least 10 years fighting.” .Even those who have taken the approach agree that it is a luxury. .“If the organizing priority is impact, that’s a privilege, but you have to have a deep tolerance for risk,” said Margot Kane, chief investment officer of Spring Point Partners, which is a social venture fund created by the Berwind family of Philadelphia, whose wealth dates to 19th-century coal mining. .For anyone considering taking the middle ground, here are the two key questions: How do you determine if an investment qualifies as impact first? And since impact, not return, is the primary motivation, how do you measure it? .Let’s start with selection. .“One of the things we ask ourselves when we’re doing due diligence on one of these projects is, ‘Is this a really great catalytic investment or a very bad market-rate investment?’” said Liesel Pritzker Simmons, co-founder and principal of Blue Haven Initiative and a member of the family whose wealth derives from Hyatt hotels. .“Honestly, it tends to come down to what is the problem they’re trying to solve and is the nature of that solution super-scalable or not?” she said. .Members of the Berwind family invested through Spring Point in a convertible bond from Greenprint Partners, which improves storm water drainage in low-income communities. .“They’re off to the races now, with more established lending partners now,” Ms. Kane said. “They graduated away from needing our support.” .That type of success is one measure of effectiveness. But it’s not always easy to measure the impact. .On climate issues, the accepted measurement is a ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent, said Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation Investment Management, the impact-investing fund that former Vice President Al Gore co-founded. .“With climate, you can measure how much is removed from the environment each year,” he said. “Beyond climate, the units of measurement aren’t as well accepted. How do you measure a unit of biodiversity? No one knows that. Something like education or poverty alleviation — there isn’t an accepted measurement.” .At family foundations, the measurement can be something the family determines before making the investment. “We take a fairly light touch,” Ms. Pritzker Simmons said. “We want to know what the return is and what are the top three impact key performance indicators. One extra dimension is we look at with a catalytic investment is: Did it do what it said it was going to do, and did it scale?” .Sometimes that is fairly apparent. An example: Pula is an organization that connects small farmers all over Africa with crop insurance and uses data to evaluate the yields from small farms so that crop insurers will write policies. .It’s now working with 1.7 million farmers across 13 countries on the continent; those farmers have insurance for $600 million in agricultural investments, like the purchase of seeds and fertilizers. .Rose Goslinga, co-chief executive and founder of Pula, said impact-first investment was what made the business possible. “Last year, we balanced the books,” she said. “Coming from a more traditional development background, I was happy we didn’t make a loss.”",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/your-money/impact-investing-social-change.html
,"Tesla said on Friday that it more than doubled the number of cars it delivered in the first quarter, bouncing back after the pandemic slowed sales in the same period a year ago. .The electric carmaker said it sold 184,8000 vehicles in the first three months of the year, up from 88,500 a year ago. It produced 180,338 vehicles, compared with 102,672 in the first quarter of 2020. .The company’s sales numbers, which cover the entire world, come a day after General Motors and Ford Motor  .. Tesla does not break out its sales by region and a lot of its recent growth has been in China, where electric cars make up a much larger share of the auto market than in the United States. .Tesla was helped by the arrival of the Model Y, a roomier version of its Model 3 sedan. Those two cars accounted for almost all of its deliveries in the first quarter. It reported just 2,020 deliveries of its high-end cars — the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle. .Tesla has halted production of the Model S and Model X while preparing its plant in Fremont, Calif., to build updated versions of the cars. The company said in a statement that it was “in the early stages of ramping production” of the new models, which generate much more profit than the Model 3 and Model Y. .The first-quarter sales numbers could lift Tesla shares, which have lost more than a quarter of their value since January when they hit a high of about $900.

Why the Markets Need a Strong Government Hand,"Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, is said to have joked that if the federal government were put in charge of the Sahara, in five years there would be a shortage of sand. .That antigovernment attitude has been embraced by countless free-market enthusiasts. President Ronald Reagan  . it clearly in his first Inaugural Address: “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” For decades, this perspective has gained influence in American political discourse. .The resulting hostility to government has been costly. It helped spawn not just the recent Texas electric grid meltdown but also a long string of similar failures, including responses to Hurricane Katrina, the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. .None of these challenges came without warning. A similar cold-induced grid failure had occurred in Texas in 2011, prompting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to warn that unless the state took steps to weatherproof its infrastructure, even more serious failures would be inevitable. Yet Texas not only failed to take those steps, it acted to  . from connecting to the national power grid, exempting them from federal regulation. .More serious challenges are in store. Referring to the lessons of the pandemic year, the novelist Ian McEwan  ., “Covid is our mass tutorial, our dress rehearsal for all the depredations as well as tragedies that the climate emergency could bring.” As David Wallace-Wells described in his  ., “The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming,” .the storms, droughts and wildfires of recent years offer only a hint of much bigger threats ahead. .The antigovernment movement is easily the biggest obstacle to society’s ability to parry those threats. It is therefore an opportune moment to scrutinize the economic arguments of government opponents in their own terms. .Many cite the Invisible Hand theory of the economist Adam Smith in support of their claim that unregulated markets harness the interests of self-interested individuals in the service of society as a whole. This is a remarkable claim, and Smith’s contribution was to identify conditions under which it might be expected to hold. But as Smith also understood clearly, individual and collective interests often diverge sharply. .That’s why most modern economists believe that societies function best when resources are allocated in part by private market forces and in part by collective guidance from government. But at one edge of the opinion spectrum lies an influential group of economists, many of them inspired by Mr. Friedman, who are hostile to almost any form of government involvement in economic life. .Many of their arguments appear rooted in a belief that government is inherently inefficient. There are bridges to nowhere and other vivid examples of government waste, to be sure. Yet detailed examination of local, state and federal government budgets reveals that the bulk of public spending goes for services that most citizens value. .More to the point, there is also substantial waste in the private sector, much of it caused by individual purchase decisions that impose costs on others. .Suppose, for example, that everyone owned a car weighing less than 2,500 pounds and someone then bought one that weighed 5,000 pounds. That person would face less risk of injury and death than before, while all others would face more. Their best response may be to buy 5,000-pound cars themselves, in which case everyone’s risk would be higher than when all were driving smaller cars. .Similarly, at crowded gatherings in enclosed spaces (remember them, before the pandemic?), when all speak more loudly to hear better, they don’t hear as well as they would have if all had spoken more softly. .In these cases, individually rational behavior is collectively irrational. Buying 5,000-pound cars when 2,500-pound cars would be better for almost everyone is waste, pure and simple. .Taxing vehicles by weight would be a relatively unintrusive remedy. But opponents of government might object, saying such measures are social engineering. Yes, but so are speed limits and traffic lights. Policies that try to bring individual and collective interests into closer alignment exist in all countries, for good reason. And as long as we have to tax something, why not tax activities that cause harm to others? Every dollar raised from such levies can be a dollar less from the many taxes currently imposed on beneficial activities. .Former President George W. Bush once said, “We don’t believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of Americans.” Yet that’s exactly what all societies entrust government bureaucrats to do, again for good reason: Even if people are just as rational and markets just as competitive as Mr. Friedman believed, individually rational actions often yield demonstrably bad outcomes.  .The government requires catalytic converters on cars, for instance, because each individual’s decision to install one would be costly and yield no measurable impact on air quality. Yet when everyone installs a catalytic converter, the benefit of the improvement in air quality far outweighs the corresponding cost. .Many in the antigovernment movement have objected that people’s liberties are unjustly curtailed by evidence-based public health regulations, as when state and local jurisdictions have imposed mask ordinances. .Measures to limit travel or attendance at sporting events, universities or workplaces to people who have been  . against the coronavirus arouse similarly intense pushback. But these steps, too, are grounded on the disjuncture between individual and collective interests: Avoiding vaccines and masks affects not just the individual but the multitude of others placed at greater risk of infection. .As John Stuart Mill, the celebrated champion of individual liberty,  ., “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Without a preposterous claim that easily preventable deaths don’t constitute harm to others, it’s hard to argue that the pandemic restrictions fail Mill’s test. .Conflicts between individual and collective interests also motivate government interventions against both climate and financial instability. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions entails steps that may be costly to an individual but whose benefits accrue to billions of others. Similarly, a poorly justified loan may entail only small costs to the bank that issues it, but the collective consequences of such loans can be years of economic recession. .Free-market enthusiasts often insist, plausibly, that people spend their own money more carefully than any bureaucrat would. But that observation misses the larger point that individual and collective interests often fail to coincide. .Spending that promotes individual interests is, in fact, directly responsible for many of the greatest threats now facing society. And by a wide margin, the most formidable barrier to the collective action necessary to meet those threats is the belief that government is our biggest problem. .Robert H.

,"For months, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, arguably the most powerful individual in the oil business, has urged his fellow producers to keep a tight rein on output, fearing additional crude could flood the world’s markets and cause prices to drop. At the same time, some producers, notably Russia, have been chafing to open the spigot a bit more. .On Thursday, the prince seemed to relent, as the group called OPEC Plus — the members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia — agreed to modest output increases over the next three months. .Analysts said the prince, who is the chair of OPEC Plus, appeared to be calculating that by appeasing other producers who want to produce more oil, he can remain in control over the longer term. .The prince repeated his go-slow message on Thursday, arguing that the global economic recovery from the pandemic remained fragile, and so his willingness to sign off on an increase came as something of a surprise. But the decision seemed to be an acknowledgment of the diversity of opinions within OPEC Plus, and that he must take the views of other key producers like Russia and the United Arab Emirates into account to maintain leadership and to keep them from going their own way. .“It is not my decision, it is everybody’s decision,” he said at a news conference after Thursday’s OPEC Plus meeting. .So far traders have signaled their approval by pushing up prices in what had been a weak market. On Friday, Brent crude, the international benchmark was up about 3.4 percent to $64.86 a barrel. .Under the deal agreed to on Thursday, OPEC Plus will gradually increase production by 350,000 barrels a day in May and June and 441,000 barrels a day in July. Over the same period, the Saudis will also relax the one million barrels a day they have been voluntarily keeping off the market, bringing the total increase to about 2.1 million barrels a day by July. .The plan “points to a still cautious and orderly ramp-up from OPEC Plus, still allowing for a tight oil market,” rather than a flood, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. .OPEC Plus also retain the option of adjusting output at monthly meetings. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, can also take unilateral decisions to trim supplies. .This ability to quickly backtrack “provides the prince with comfort that he is exercising a fairly low-risk option,” Helima Croft, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/saudi-arabia-opec-oil-prices.html
"China Puts Limits on Foreign Banks, Worrying Businesses","SHANGHAI — To defend against accusations by Washington and others that it doesn’t play fair on trade, Beijing could point to the banks. Chinese leaders have been  . they had erected around the country’s vast financial system, giving Wall Street and European lenders a greater shot at winning business in the world’s second-largest economy. .Now the walls are going up again. .New Chinese rules have sharply limited the ability of foreign banks to do business there, making them less competitive against local rivals, according to three people with knowledge of the directives. One set of rules enacted in December and January restricts how much money foreign banks can transfer into China from overseas. Another that took effect on Wednesday required many foreign banks to make fewer loans and sell off bonds and other investments, two of the people said. .The new rules have caused a stir among the global bank executives and foreign companies in China that depend on those lenders for money, the people said. Among other concerns, they worry that the rules could make foreign-owned businesses more dependent on China’s state-run banking system for the money they need to grow. That dependence could give Beijing another potential pressure point to use as it squares off against Washington and others over trade, human rights, geopolitics and other sticky issues. .Banks and trade groups have been reluctant to speak publicly for fear of triggering further regulatory measures. But in a January letter to China’s central bank that was reviewed by The New York Times, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China raised concerns about the money transfer limits. .“In some cases, the risk brought about by this major structural change may fundamentally overturn the strategic development direction of E.U. banks” in China, the letter said. .The new rules could complicate already thorny political issues, such as  ., a pending investment agreement between  . and long-simmering tensions over how Beijing  . of the Chinese currency. President Biden has  . in letting up on the trade demands pressed by his predecessor, Donald J. Trump. The two sides are also clashing over human rights, particularly Beijing’s  . in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang and its  .. .International companies have been caught in the middle. Over the past two weeks, Chinese state media and the country’s online community have  . like H&M, the Swedish retailer, and Nike, the American athletic brand, after they vowed not to use cotton made by forced labor in Xinjiang. .The reasons behind China’s new banking rules aren’t clear, though they appear to have little to do with the tense political environment. They seem to be aimed instead at stemming big, potentially disruptive flows of money into the country. .“I can understand how this is about protecting financial stability,” said Mark Sobel, a former United States Treasury official. “I can also understand how you could argue this is discriminating against foreign banks.” .The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank and the issuer of the rules, didn’t respond to requests for comment. .China, which keeps tight control over money flows in and out of the country, may be worried that a surge of funds into the country could lead to nasty surprises like inflation. Money poured into the country in the second half of last year as the Chinese economy threw off its pandemic doldrums while activity in much of the rest of the world shrank. .Measuring flows is difficult, but foreign investors last year increased their holdings of Chinese bonds by about $150 billion. China also  . by taking in $163 billion worth of direct investments in factories, office buildings, companies and other assets. .Big money flows into a country can also make its currency rise in value — and China appears to working hard to counter that. .China’s currency, the renminbi, rose sharply in value against the U.S. dollar in the second half of last year. In May, $1 was worth about 7.15 renminbi. By year’s end, $1 bought about 6.5 renminbi. That rise was bad news for China’s exporters because it made their goods less competitive overseas. .But since the Chinese government enacted its new banking rules, the currency has begun to weaken. It now stands at about 6.6 renminbi to the dollar. .The new rules alone aren’t likely significant enough to account for the sudden halt to the renminbi’s rise. But they join other moves made by the Chinese government in recent months that have made moving money into China slightly harder and moving it out slightly easier. Combined, they could put pressure on the renminbi to weaken. .“This has started since last October, and they are all on the same side,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University. .Outside factors have likely contributed to the renminbi’s shift, including the resurgence of the U.S. economy, which could lead investors to steer their money there instead. .Chinese officials have stressed in recent months that their country is open to foreign investment, particularly banking. .“The inflow of foreign capital is inevitable, but so far, the scale and speed are still within our control,” Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, which has worked closely with the central bank on the new policies, said during a news conference on March 2. “We continue to encourage foreign financial institutions to enter China for shared development.” .In an unsuccessful attempt to head off a trade war with the Trump administration, China gradually relaxed or removed limits on foreign banks, insurers and money management firms. Big banks responded by expanding their mainland operations, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. .The global financial environment has encouraged money flows into China. With near zero interest rates elsewhere, international banks borrowed cheaply abroad. Until the new rules kicked in, they could send that money to China and lend or invest it there, reaping higher returns. .The first of the new rules, issued in a memo to banks in December, appeared to be aimed at that trend. That rule limited the ability of global banks to raise money overseas and move it into China. The rule is being phased in through November but was written in a way that has already had a big effect on financial contracts involving bets on the renminbi’s direction, said the people familiar with the notice. .Another measure communicated directly by Chinese regulators to foreign banks three weeks ago concerned the size of bank balance sheets, two of the people said. .Concerned about the rapid growth of credit in the Chinese economy, regulators ordered domestic and foreign banks to limit their balance sheets by Wednesday night to show only slight growth from last year. Because China has recently loosened limits on foreign purchases of bonds, many foreign banks had been buying more bonds for sale to foreign customers, expanding their balance sheets. .The full impact of the new rules will depend on how long they stay in place. Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, predicted that China would eventually resume opening up to foreign financial institutions. .“They don’t want to scare off foreign investors in the medium to long term,” he said.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/china-foreign-banks.html
Pandemic Helps Stir Interest in Teaching Financial Literacy,"Two dozen state legislatures are considering bills on financial literacy education, an unusually high number, proponents say. .They attribute the interest to concern about the burden of student debt, as well as heightened awareness about income and economic inequality as a result of the pandemic. .“There’s a recognition that folks are being left behind,” said Tim Ranzetta, founder of Next Gen Personal Finance, a nonprofit group that creates free courses and funds training for high school teachers. Next Gen compiled  . of bills submitted for consideration in 25 states. It’s unclear how many will pass, Mr. Ranzetta said. .As of early 2020, high school students in 21 states were required to take a personal finance course to graduate, according to the  ., which promotes economic and personal finance education for students in kindergarten through high school. That was a net gain of four states since the council’s previous count two years earlier. .“We are making progress,” said Billy J. Hensley, president and chief executive of the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group that promotes effective financial education. .“I do think the pandemic is bringing more attention to the topic,” he said, noting that after the financial crisis more than a decade ago there was also a flurry of financial literacy proposals in state legislatures. .An increasing number of studies support the effectiveness of financial literacy education when taught by well-trained teachers, said Nan J. Morrison, chief executive of the Council for Economic Education. And more teachers now say they feel confident teaching the material.  . released in March by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and Montana State University found significant increases in teacher participation in professional development. .Still, the rigor of high school financial education varies. Just six states require high school students to complete a semester-long, stand-alone personal finance course, the council’s 2020 report found. Some states permit shorter courses or include the content as part of another class. .In states that don’t require financial instruction, some schools opt to teach it and do an excellent job, but others ignore the subject completely — and they tend to be schools in less affluent districts, Mr. Hensley said. .In the latest round of legislative proposals, some states are merely encouraging the teaching of financial skills while a few would make the subject a graduation requirement. Ohio, for instance, is considering a proposal that would require high school students to pass a half-credit class in personal finance in order to graduate. The class must be taught by a teacher trained in the subject matter. .The bill would also create a fund to help pay for training to teach the subject, said State Senator Steve Wilson, a Republican and former banking executive who co-sponsored the bill. He said he was hopeful that the bill would be voted out of committee this month. .“Kids come out of school having no clue about financial literacy,” Senator Wilson said. “You go out into the world greatly disadvantaged.” .Many financial literacy advocates consider a full-semester course the gold standard for personal finance instruction. Rebecca Maxcy, director of the Financial Education Initiative at the University of Chicago, said many courses focused mainly on skills, like writing a check or filing taxes. While those lessons can be helpful, she said, it’s important for courses to include discussions of how personal values and attitudes about money influence behavior, as well as an examination of the financial systems and potential barriers that students will encounter in the world of money. .Questions like “Who benefits when you open a bank account?” can prompt meaningful discussions, she said. .Some curriculum options, however, offer more condensed, basic instruction. .Everfi, a digital instructional company, offers a free seven-session program for high school financial literacy. Students take interactive, self-guided lessons in topics like banking, budgeting and college financing. .Sidney Strause, a freshman at Marshall University in West Virginia, said she had taken Everfi’s course as a junior in high school. The lessons were assigned as part of another course she was taking, and typically took 45 minutes to an hour to complete. .“It taught me how to budget and save,” she said. “It’s crucial to adulthood.” Sometimes she would do the lessons at home and discuss them with her mother, she said, which led her mother to create a budget and set financial goals. .Several groups, including the Council on Economic Education, provide guidance on quality educational materials. The council publishes  . and benchmarks, the University of Chicago’s Financial Education Initiative has created  .of characteristics for “high quality” financial education, and the  ., a nonprofit group, maintains a list of educational programs. .Here are some questions and answers about financial literacy: .While results vary, recent studies suggest that “well-implemented” state education mandates lead to a “clear improvement in financial behaviors,” according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  . from the National Endowment for Financial Education, for instance, found that required financial education could help students make smarter decisions about paying for college. .Ms. Maxcy of the Financial Education Initiative said that talking with a parent or trusted adult about money issues could be a powerful learning tool for students, but that it was often difficult for parents to start conversations. The program’s research led to the creation of a deck of 105 “Talking Cents” cards that pose simple questions to start a discussion.

,"ENFIELD, Conn. — The bones of Brooks Brothers stores are scattered across 100,000 square feet here in a warehouse near the Massachusetts border, mixed in with a sea of cardboard boxes and junk. .There are legions of mannequins, empty circular tables that once displayed neckties, posters of horseback-riding gentlemen from a bygone era. There is a whole section of Christmas trees and countless gold-painted ornaments of sheep suspended by ribbon — a  . since 1850 known as the Golden Fleece. Blank order forms for tailors are strewn about. A neon sign that apparently still works. There is no apparel, but there are rows of heavy sewing machines that most likely came from one of the brand’s recently shuttered factories. And in the bathroom, a welcome carpet with Brooks Brothers written in cursive sits next to a toilet. .The whole mass was abandoned here in the fallout of Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy filing and sale last year, the scraps of a retailer that made nearly $1 billion in sales in 2019. Ever since, the couple that owns the warehouse, Chip and Rosanna LaBonte, has been scrambling to figure out how to get rid of it all. Junk removal companies have told them it will cost at least $240,000 to clear the space, which Brooks Brothers had rented through November. In order to pay the bill, the LaBontes are going to have to sell their home. .The couple’s plight illustrates the far-reaching consequences of  ., which cascaded during the pandemic and affected everyone from factory workers to executives. Smaller vendors and landlords have often been left holding the  .during lengthy byzantine bankruptcy proceedings, particularly with limits on what they can spend on legal bills compared with larger corporations. And once bankrupt brands are sold, people like the LaBontes are typically left in the dust. .“It is a very sad situation that unfortunately does happen quite a bit because it is just part of the bankruptcy situation as the statute is drafted,” said James Van Horn, partner and retail bankruptcy specialist at Barnes & Thornburg. “Unfortunately, creditors can become victims, and sometimes they have little or no options to recover what is owed them.” .Retailers like Brooks Brothers were prominent among the more than 600  . in the United States last year, which had the highest number of filings in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. .The LaBontes, who are in their 60s, have been working with a liquidator to sell what they can of the Brooks Brothers detritus, and are about to list their home in Sherborn, Mass. While they have filed a claim in bankruptcy court, they are anticipating receiving less than 5 percent of what they are owed, if that — and confessed that the proceedings are hopelessly confusing. Most of all, they are angry and incredulous about the situation, especially as Brooks Brothers continues to operate under wealthy new owners. .“We understand going out of business and the bankruptcy, but to dump their problem on us and walk away from it and make us incur this cleanup cost?” Mr. LaBonte said in an interview in Enfield. “Nobody would anticipate an expense like this — we don’t have rainy day money to deal with it.” .The couple bought the warehouse in 2010. They said that it was their first foray into commercial real estate and that they worked on residential projects before that. They have other tenants and a self-storage section, but are frustrated about the mess and the fact they can’t use the space for anything else until it is cleared. .Brooks Brothers, which was founded in 1818 and is the oldest continuously operated apparel brand in the United States, began renting the warehouse in Enfield in 2011, most recently at a rate of roughly $20,000 a month. (Brooks Brothers also has a corporate office and distribution center in Enfield.) The building, which spans about 375,000 square feet, is held by the LaBontes through KBRC Realty. It’s the firm’s sole holding and the couple’s main source of income. .The office attire segment of retailing as a whole was battered last year as many Americans worked remotely, ditching  .. J. Crew and the owners of Ann Taylor and Men’s Wearhouse also filed for bankruptcy, while sales nose-dived at chains like Banana Republic. Temporary store closures added to the distress, along with the cancellations of special occasions like proms, graduations, weddings and other events. .All that led up to Brooks Brothers’  . one of the most significant retail collapses of 2020. Brooks Brothers had dressed all but four U.S. presidents at the time of its filing, and prided itself on its American factories, which were also forced to close. .But investors saw value in the brand, and the retailer was quickly purchased for $325 million by Simon Property Group, the biggest U.S. mall operator, and Authentic Brands Group, a licensing firm. .The firms have been buying up a string of bankrupt mall retailers through a joint venture called ., including Lucky Brand denim and Forever 21, leveraging the combination of Authentic Brands’ expertise in licensing famous brand names in various lucrative and creative (and some say equity-destructive) ways and Simon’s real estate portfolio. .At the time of the Brooks Brothers purchase, SPARC committed to keep operating at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail locations, compared with 424 retail and outlet stores globally before the pandemic. .Under the new owners, Brooks Brothers switched to wire transfers instead of checks, but kept paying rent on the warehouse through November, sending even more goods there as it closed dozens of stores and shuttered its ., Mr. and Ms. LaBonte said. But after Thanksgiving, it sent a letter to the couple rejecting the lease as well as the contents of the warehouse. According to a person with knowledge of the deal, the warehouse and its contents had not been part of SPARC’s purchase of Brooks Brothers. As a result, said Mr. Van Horn said, the new owner most likely has no legal responsibility to the LaBontes. .A representative for SPARC stopped returning requests for comment. .“They used it for all of their store fixtures, so tables, props, fishing poles, canoes, everything you would see that would go in and out of a store to decorate it,” Mr. LaBonte said. “There’s probably 20,000 square feet of Christmas trees — everything except the actual merchandise.” .As to who would want it now: Customers have included local clothing makers looking for mannequins and a set designer from an upcoming HBO series called “The Gilded Age.” Last Monday, an older couple wandered through the space, looking at the Christmas decorations and empty gift boxes. Habitat for Humanity has been looking at the haul for several days and is taking some of the goods. Still, Mr. LaBonte estimated that somewhere around 30 percent of the leftovers have been sold. .The liquidator paid the LaBontes approximately $20,000 to sell what they can through mid-April or so. The couple will not receive a cut, and will deal with what’s left. When junk removal specialists assessed the cost of clearing the space in December, one quote was around $243,000 while the other was closer to $290,000. .“We’re just another Covid casualty to them, we get that,” Ms. LaBonte said of Brooks Brothers. “But I also don’t think they realized how much stuff was there.” .The junk removal firms, which confirmed the prices with The New York Times, said that it was expensive to remove the volume of goods. The costs included labor, multiple trips to dumps, donation and recycling centers, and the use of specialized equipment such as a forklift, large dumpsters and an 18-foot box truck. .“I’ve been doing this for seven years and I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Rick McDonald Jr., the owner of EastSide Junk, which provided the $243,000 quote to the couple. “They left an astronomical amount of stuff.” .When Authentic Brands, the licensing firm, announced the purchase of Brooks Brothers out of bankruptcy last year, Jamie Salter, the company’s chief executive, spoke about the retailer’s legacy and its “incredible history.” .The LaBontes, confronting a warehouse full of some of that history, were unhappy to see those comments. .They put out a statement recently asking: “What kind of heritage can they claim when they operate like low-rent, fly-by-night bullies?” .Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or Vanessa Friedman at vanessa.friedman@nytimes.com.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/brooks-brothers-retail-bankruptcy.html
,"WASHINGTON — Kimberly Vasquez, a high school senior in Baltimore, faced a tough problem when the pandemic began. She had no fast internet service in her home, but all her classes were online. .Marigold Lewi, a sophomore at the same school, was regularly booted off Zoom classes because of her slow home connection. .Ms. Lewi spent a lot of time explaining Zoom absences to teachers. Ms. Vasquez sat outside local libraries to use their internet access and at times used her phone. The two of them helped push a successful public campaign for better and free service to low-income families in the city. .“It was very chaotic,” Ms. Vasquez said. “We had to do this because no one else was going to change things.” .A year after the pandemic turned the nation’s digital divide into an education emergency, President Biden, inheriting the problem, is making affordable broadband a top priority, comparing it to the effort to spread electricity across the country.  ., announced on Wednesday, includes $100 billion to extend fast internet access to every home. .The money is meant to improve the economy by enabling all Americans to work, get medical care and take classes from wherever they live. Although the government has spent billions on the digital divide in the past, the efforts have failed to close it partly because people in different areas have different problems. Affordability is the main culprit in urban and suburban areas. In many rural areas, internet service isn’t available at all because of the high costs of installation. .“We’ll make sure every single American has access to high-quality, affordable, high speed internet,” Mr. Biden said in a speech on Wednesday. “And when I say affordable, I mean it. Americans pay too much for internet. We will drive down the price for families who have service now. We will make it easier for families who don’t have affordable service to be able to get it now.” .Longtime advocates of universal broadband say the plan, which requires congressional approval, may finally come close to fixing the digital divide, a stubborn problem first identified and named by regulators during the Clinton administration. The plight of unconnected students during the pandemic added urgency. .“This is a vision document that says every American needs access and should have access to affordable broadband,” said Blair Levin, who directed the 2010 National Broadband Plan at the Federal Communications Commission. “And I haven’t heard that before from a White House to date.” .Some advocates for expanded broadband access cautioned that Mr. Biden’s plan might not entirely solve the divide between the digital haves and have-nots. .The plan promises to give priority to municipal and nonprofit broadband providers but would still rely on private companies to install cables and erect cell towers to far reaches of the country. One concern is that the companies won’t consider the effort worth their time, even with all the money earmarked for those projects. During the electrification boom of the 1920s, private providers were reluctant to install poles and string lines hundreds of miles into sparsely populated areas. .There are also many questions about how the administration plans to address affordability. It is one thing to extend service to homes; it is another to make it inexpensive enough for people once it gets there. The White House was scant on details on Wednesday, though it stressed that subsidies alone were not a long-term solution. .In addition, the money would arrive more than a year after the pandemic closed schools and as many were starting to reopen their doors. As a result, many students without good internet connections have already fallen a full year behind. .About 25 percent of students don’t have adequate broadband at home, with Native American, Black and Latino children hardest hit, said Becky Pringle, the president the National Education Association, the teachers’ union. .Mr. Biden’s plan would be tested in places like Chinle, a school district in the Navajo Nation in northeast Arizona. As with electrification, the most remote homes — particularly on Native land — got service last. Today, many homes in that isolated corner of the state have no access to broadband or speeds that are so slow even one device on a Zoom conference takes up most of the bandwidth. Cellular phone service is nonexistent or spotty in many parts. .School is slowly beginning to return to the classroom. But until last week, 31 buses were sent out daily with packets of printouts for homework and flash drives with videos of lessons for math, science, history and English. The graduation rate is expected to be near 60 percent this year, down from 77 percent last year, said Quincy Natay, the superintendent of the Chinle Unified School District. .“It has been a tough and challenging year,” Mr. Natay said. “A lot of learning loss has occurred for this group.” .Congress has approved more than $10 billion in the past few months to help make broadband more affordable and to put more laptops and other devices in students’ hands. Of those funds, the F.C.C. is working to figure out how to distribute $7.2 billion for broadband service, devices, and potentially routers and other equipment for households with school-age children. .In February, the  . for low-income families from $3.2 billion granted by Congress in December for emergency digital divide funding. Both programs involve one-time emergency funding to address broadband access problems exacerbated by the pandemic. .The administration’s $100 billion plan aims to connect even the most isolated residents: the 35 percent of rural homes without access. In those areas, the White House said, it would focus on “future-proof” technology, which analysts take to mean fiber and other high-bandwidth technology. The administration highlighted its support for networks run and owned by municipalities, nonprofits and rural electrical cooperatives. Several states have banned municipal broadband networks, and the F.C.C. failed in its attempts to overturn those bans in court during the Obama administration. .The Biden infrastructure plan faces a tough path in Congress. Republicans have pushed back on the cost. They even argue about definitions of broadband. Republicans balk at some proposals to require faster broadband standards — such as 25 megabits for downloads and as much as 25 megabits for uploads, which they say is a bar too high for providers in rural areas. Those speeds would allow multiple family members to be on videoconferencing, for example. .“I believe that this would make it harder to serve those communities that don’t have broadband today,” Michael O’Rielly, a former F.C.C. commissioner, told the House commerce committee last month. .Educators lobbied Congress throughout the pandemic to extend broadband in the country. When little relief was in sight, some took matters into their own hands. .Last April and through the summer, administrators at the Brockton School District in Massachusetts bought more than 4,000 hot spots with their own funding and a federal loan. They were able to reduce the percentage of students without high-speed internet or a device to about 5 to 10 percent, from about 30 percent. .Superintendent Mike Thomas said the district was starting to go back to classrooms and would most likely be fully in person by the fall. But he plans to retain many aspects of distance learning, he said, particularly after-school tutoring. .In Baltimore, where an estimated 40 percent of households lack high-speed internet, students and community activists fought to raise awareness of their circumstances. Ms. Vasquez and Ms. Lewi held protests against Comcast, the dominant provider, for better speeds and lower costs for its much-publicized low-income program. Their group .Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society, also lobbied the Maryland legislature and the city to put a priority on affordable broadband for low-income households. .“We didn’t have options, and we deserved better,” Ms. Vasquez said. .Adam Bouhmad and some community activists began to install antenna “mesh” networks tapping into the hot spots of closed Baltimore schools to connect surrounding homes. Through a jury-rigged system of antennas and routers, Mr. Bouhmad’s group, Waves, got cheap or free internet service to 120 low-income families. .Mr. Biden’s promise to support alternative broadband providers could include projects like the one led by Mr. Bouhmad, who said the past year had shown how scant broadband options had left residents in Baltimore in the lurch. .“Investment upfront to build out infrastructure and support internet providers is fantastic,” Mr. Bouhmad said. He added that residents in places like Baltimore would continue to need federal subsidies and that the administration should focus on the costs of broadband as a major hurdle. .“Availability doesn’t equal accessibility in terms of price and user experience,” he said.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/technology/digital-divide-rural-wifi.html

I understand why you’re trying to raise awareness of D.E.I. and make your employer establish a structured plan. And I imagine it is very lonely being the only person who is willing to do this work. .Unfortunately, there is little that we can do to make people care about these issues. At some point, you have to decide how long you’re going to do this extra work for colleagues who aren’t willing to meet you even halfway. Of course you feel resentful. This is an absurd situation and one that you should not have to deal with. As for your colleague, it is the height of privilege to be able to avoid the discomfort of discussing difficult issues. So much important work toward change happens in the uncomfortable moments where we are forced to confront the things that challenge us. .Your colleague asserted that “this is the world of classical music.” What does that even mean? People of color both create and consume classical music. I would suggest starting small with the change that you want to see. Perhaps you can organize programs for your colleagues that can help educate them about classical musicians and composers of color, like Scott Joplin, Florence Beatrice Price, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and George Bridgetower, and contemporary artists, like Lara Downes, Wynton Marsalis and Jessie Montgomery. .That said, you can do only so much and, frankly, you have done enough.

The leisure and hospitality sector led the way, adding 280,000 jobs as Americans returned to restaurants and resorts in greater numbers. Construction firms added 110,000 jobs as the housing market stayed strong and activity resumed following winter storms in February. .The unemployment rate fell to 6 percent, down from 6.2 percent in February. .“March’s jobs report is the most optimistic report since the pandemic began,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist of the career site Glassdoor. “It’s not the largest gain in payrolls since the pandemic began, but it’s the first where it seems like the finish line is in sight.” .The report came one year after the pandemic ripped a hole in the American labor market. The U.S. economy lost 1.7 million jobs in March 2020 and more than 20 million in April, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 15 percent. .The job market bounced back quickly at first, but progress began to slow as virus cases surged and states reimposed restrictions on businesses. Over the winter, the recovery stalled out, with employers cutting more than 300,000 jobs in December. .Economists said the latest data marked a turning point.

The March data was collected early in the month, before most states broadened vaccine access and before most Americans began  . from the federal government as part of the most recent relief package. .“The tide is turning,” said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist for Bank of America.

Biden Faces ‘a Very Precarious Point’ in the Coronavirus Response,"President Biden continues to receive  . from the public for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and Americans are increasingly telling pollsters that they think the worst of the pandemic is behind us. On Thursday, the Consumer Confidence Index, a weekly measure of the public’s economic attitudes,  . since the start of the pandemic. .And as more vaccines become available, the administration has been beating its own targets on shot distribution. .But the virus is still here — and with case counts rising again in parts of the country, the more aggressive variants of the original Covid-19 strain have grown increasingly prevalent. Mr. Biden is now in a complicated situation: He’s taking a victory lap while pumping the brakes. .“It’s a mixed message,” said Lee Miringoff, the director of polling at Marist College. “There’s an eagerness to pop the champagne cork on one hand, and on the other hand to say, ‘Danger may lurk right around the corner.’ It’s a mixed message, which is hard, and it’s being communicated to a Covid-fatigued country.” .Marist’s most recent poll, for  .,” found that just 25 percent of American adults said they wouldn’t get the vaccine when it became available — a lower degree of reluctance than in any prior Marist poll, driven in part by a thawing of opposition among supporters of former President Donald Trump. .But with only 36 percent of respondents saying they had been vaccinated, there is a variety of experiences to contend with. “You have some people who are opening up because they feel they’re vaccinated, and others who still want to see how this plays out,” Mr. Miringoff said. “So there’s lots of categories now, and that makes political messaging more complicated.” .Even as the president announced this week that 90 percent of adults should be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine by April 19, he said that states should pause their plans to reopen businesses. He called for mask mandates to remain in place, warning that the country might be in danger of “giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains” if governors abandoned them. .Mr. Biden told ESPN yesterday that it would be “a mistake” for the Texas Rangers baseball team to allow a full-capacity crowd to attend Opening Day next week, as the team has said it plans to do. “I think it’s not responsible,” he said. .His comments appeared to be at least partly directed at Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who lifted the state’s mask mandate last month and declared that all businesses could reopen. .Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned this week of “impending doom” if a new surge in cases were allowed to continue unabated. In an interview on Thursday with “CBS This Morning,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and a leader of Biden’s virus response team, echoed Dr. Walensky’s concerns. “Please be careful,” he said. “Don’t declare victory prematurely.” .Air travel  . at small, regional airports and vacation destinations, although those in major cities are still serving only about a quarter to a half of their usual volume. .Some locales, cruise lines and venues are requiring incoming travelers to show vaccination cards proving that they have been inoculated. But the Biden administration has not instituted a policy, leaving it up to the private sector instead. .While hospitalizations and deaths remain far lower than they were during the pandemic’s peak in January, case counts have risen in recent weeks — sometimes drastically — particularly in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. .Michigan, the site of a pitched debate over virus restrictions last year, leads the country in cases per capita: As of yesterday, seven of the 10 most heavily infected counties in the country are in Michigan. The New York tristate area has also seen a marked rise in cases. .Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative at the Columbia University Earth Institute, said that the decline in cases this winter had understandably created a false sense of security. .“The fact is that we are in a very precarious point, in that where we go from here is not at all clear,” he said in an interview. “On some level, yes, we did drop the daily infection rates and fatality rates, but we dropped them to a level that’s not exactly comforting.” .Dr. Redlener said he supported the administration’s emphasis on delivering vaccinations as quickly as possible, and its insistence on keeping mask mandates in place. .“It’s become somewhat of a cliché, but we are running a race between the vaccine and the variants,” he said. “The more time that it takes to get people vaccinated up to a herd immunity level, which people think is about 80 percent, the longer we’re going to see these outbreaks of Covid-19 that will inevitably create more mutations, more variants.”",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/politics/biden-covid-numbers.html
Biden Tax Plan Challenges G.O.P. Formula for Economic Growth,"President Biden’s ambitious plan to increase  . does more than just reverse much of the overhaul pushed through by his predecessor. It also offers a profoundly different vision of how to make the United States more competitive and how to foot the bill. .When President Donald J. Trump and a Republican Congress  ., most of the benefits went to the wealthiest Americans, with lower rates on businesses and on profits from investments. The guiding principle, proponents argued, was that cutting taxes on corporations and investors would encourage businesses to expand, creating more jobs and generating more wealth for everyone. .By contrast, the animating idea behind the tax plan put forward by the Biden administration on Wednesday is that the best way to increase America’s competitiveness and foster economic growth is to raise corporate taxes to finance huge investments in transportation, broadband, utilities and more. .The Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers all welcomed the idea of pumping money into repairing and building the nation’s infrastructure, but recoiled at raising corporate taxes to do so. .“We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally — the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” the chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley,  .. .The biggest and most eye-catching proposal is to trim the sizable reduction in the corporate tax rate enacted under Mr. Trump. In 2017, Republicans shrank the rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Biden wants to nudge the rate part of the way back — to 28 percent. .The increase will “ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” and fund critical investments “to maintain the competitiveness of the United States and grow the economy,” the White House stated in outlining the plan. .The other provisions are primarily intended to ensure that multinational corporations cannot avoid taxes on profits generated overseas. The hope is that this will reduce the temptation to set up operations or offices in foreign tax havens. .The plan, which still lacks detailed provisions, is “both an undoing and a pushing in new directions,” said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School. “The more novel aspects relate to how it changes the way we think about foreign operations and global income.” .Through a series of complex and arcane provisions, the Biden administration would essentially treat profits earned abroad more like those earned at home — raising rates and requiring that taxes be paid on time rather than pushed far into the future. It would also establish what would in effect be a minimum tax on foreign income. .The proposals hew closely to what Mr. Biden promised on the campaign trail, and the immediate reactions mostly fell along predictable lines. Republicans, business groups and conservative economists said they worried that the rate increases would discourage investment. Progressive groups and liberal economists hailed the announcement, saying it would fix some glaring loopholes. . since the presidential election and has hoped that gridlock in Washington would moderate Mr. Biden’s agenda. On Wednesday, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, believed that “the corporate tax rate for companies in the U.S. has to be competitive globally, which it is now.” .Supporters countered that the changes would do much more to promote growth and go a long way in curbing excesses of the 2017 tax legislation. Democrats have argued that the low-tax approach has failed to deliver broad economic gains, with only those at the very top benefiting. Targeted government spending on workers, students and infrastructure, they argue, would offer much more bang for the buck. What’s more, businesses base their decisions on a range of factors besides tax rates. .Even economists favoring low rates on business acknowledge that the 2017 tax cuts did not produce much of an increase in investment. Gross domestic product grew at a rate of  . in the two years leading up to the law and 2.4 percent in the two years after it passed. .“There’s essentially no evidence that the tax change boosted investment,” said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He argued that investment went up in 2018 only because oil prices rose. And while the tax law favored investments in equipment and structures, it turned out that the biggest investments were not in those areas but in intellectual capital. .Supporters also argue that the proposed changes are much fairer. .“The cut in the rate was overdue but may well have been overdone,” Mr. Gale said of the Trump tax cuts. “It gave massive windfall gains to corporations,” rewarding them for investment decisions made in the past instead of providing new incentives to plow money back into their businesses, he said. .Debates about the tax code are really debates about who should bear the burden of paying for what society deems important — highways and bridges, clean water and high-speed broadband, basic research and development. .By shifting the tax burden, the Biden administration is saying corporations — among the biggest winners the last time around — should pick up more of the tab this time. .“We have pressing infrastructure needs, and the fairest way to fund those is to claw back some of the giveaways” to corporations and shareholders contained in the 2017 law, said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. .Mr. Rosenthal also pointed out that a large chunk of the increased tax payments would fall on foreigners, who own 40 percent of stocks. .The advertised tax rate — whether on corporations or individuals — is often much higher than what many actually pay. .The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has long criticized American businesses for managing to avoid paying what they owe, conducted a study of Fortune 500 companies that were profitable and that provided enough information to calculate effective tax rates. The institute found that those companies on average paid  .income. .And 91 of those companies, including Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton and IBM, paid no federal income tax that year. .Existing exemptions and deductions are not evenly distributed. Industrial machinery, gas, oil, electric and chemical companies tend to have the lowest effective rates, often less than 5 percent. .Economists have debated who actually bears the cost of higher corporate taxes — shareholders and owners or workers. Research by the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department and the Brookings Institution has concluded that those who own the business generally pay about three-quarters of a tax increase, with workers picking up the rest. .Mr. Desai at Harvard applauded the infrastructure investment but was put off by the impact of the tax increase on workers. “In a populist moment, it’s good politics but bad economics,” he said. He would prefer taxing individuals’ capital income. He also pointed out that the laserlike focus on corporations — as opposed to other businesses that may be organized differently — tended to penalize large successful companies. .It is still unclear how much would be paid by other groups favored by the current tax code, including the richest Americans and businesses that  .. (They pay taxes at the ordinary rate on their individual returns.) .The Biden administration has indicated that  . will help fund the second phase of the infrastructure plan, which is expected to be announced next month and will focus on priorities like education, health care and paid leave. .Gillian Friedman . and  .Lauren Hirsch . contributed reporting.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-tax-plan.html
,"When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, it’s fair to say he wasn’t focused on how to articulate the company’s position on the issue of voting rights. Instead, Mr. Quincey, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and has spent most of his career outside the United States, was consumed with the usual C.E.O. fare — expanding the business, keeping the share price up and not damaging the brand. .But in a measure of just how much politics has permeated big business these days, Mr. Quincey is now embroiled in a fierce debate over a wave of Republican legislation that would effectively make it harder for people to vote, including many Black voters, in some states. .As one such law made its way through the Georgia legislature in recent weeks, activists began to call on Coca-Cola, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, to publicly oppose the proposed law. Though the company doesn’t have a history of weighing in on voting rights one way or another, big companies have become increasingly drawn into social and political conversations in recent years. As a vote on the law drew near, Mr. Quincey was under pressure to pick a side. .Coca-Cola ultimately issued  . saying that “voting is a foundational right in America” and pledging to “work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country.” But it didn’t publicly weigh in on the legislation before Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it into law last Thursday. .The company’s cautious response drew protests and calls for a boycott from activists, who wanted Coca-Cola, along with other major Georgia companies like Delta Air Lines, to speak out against the new law. More than  . called on corporations to do more to protect voting rights. .Hours after the Black executives made their statement, Mr. Quincey forcefully came out against the Georgia law for the first time. “I want to be crystal clear,”  .. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.” .The statement was welcomed by activists, though many said it was too little, too late. Yet at the same time, Mr. Quincey’s words drew the ire of prominent conservatives, with Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Stephen Miller, an adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, attacking the company on Twitter. .Laws similar to the one just passed in Georgia have been proposed in nearly every state, and, in part to combat that, Congress is working on a sweeping bill that would reform voting rights nationwide. Already, activists dissatisfied with the company’s response in Georgia are pressing the company to do more around the country, while conservatives call on Coca-Cola, and Mr. Quincey, to stay out of politics. .It was another illustration, as if one was needed, of how the political polarization straining the country is creating fault lines in corporate America, with big brands caught in the middle. .The following was condensed and edited from two conversations, the second of which took place six days after the Georgia law was passed. .What changed is the legislation passed. The process was curtailed, was rushed, was not profound enough, and the resulting legislation is unacceptable, and it needs to be corrected. Work needs to be done to make this a step forward, not a step backward, in terms of broader access to voting, and that’s what we’re going to continue to advocate for as we go into this next phase. .Whatever we were doing before was not getting through. People are misconstruing, by honest error or willfully, what we have stood for and what we’re trying to do. Obviously they could disagree whether you should do more or less in private and public. But there’s enough stories out there saying the opposite of what we’ve actually said and believe in. We have to go and correct that at the very minimum, and most importantly, we need to generate some clarity that we’re going to continue to advocate against this bill. .No one in the legislature was under any illusion as to our views on the various drafts or even the final law. They knew. Would it have made any difference if we had said anything publicly? We’ll never know. If we could have done something in retrospect to have made a different outcome, of course, we would have preferred to have done it. Because we don’t like the outcome. .We’re a Georgia-based company. That’s going to be certainly our starting point. I don’t see us having the wherewithal to understand every nuance in every other state. I think there will be energy directed at the federal level. If you go back historically, federal oversight of changing the voting processes in the states has been an important process to make sure that things move forward, not backward. .It’s not that the corporate community was not involved. We were perhaps not as public as some people wish we had been, or perhaps would have made more difference. .You’ve got this tension of getting companies involved — the tension of dragging, or having companies pulled, into politics. When do I get involved? You can’t possibly be involved in every issue. So getting clear on what are the most important things to your company is what we go back to. .We’re very clear on the importance of diversity and inclusion to the Coca-Cola Company, which aspires to be a brand for everyone, and particularly in the South, given its history. We stand for diversity and inclusion in Georgia above all else, and that’s why we came to the table on this issue. We tried to affect change. It didn’t work. But we have not given up by any stretch of the imagination. .When you become C.E.O. you think you’ve got this organizational pyramid and you’ve come at the apex, and now everyone works for you. But then you find out there’s another pyramid, but it’s upside down, and you’re the one person at the bottom. .There’s a huge number of stakeholders who want to tell you what to do, and many of them don’t work in the business. So you deal with the board, the media, the investors, the analysts, the NGOs, the government. You have this whole galaxy of people you need to deal with in a way that was never true for any of the other jobs. If you haven’t gotten really clear on what are the few things that I want to tell people about and prioritize things this, it can be quite destabilizing. .The first step is to realize that something’s going wrong. When you’re a famous brand and a famous company, issues get brought to your door every day. If you want to get attention to something, calling it Coke’s fault, or thinking that Coke could help us get this fixed, is much easier than doing that with Acme, Inc., who no one’s heard of. .That doesn’t mean we should bury our heads in the sand. We need to look at them and work out, whether we agree it’s a real problem, and what are we in favor of as part of the solution? We can’t solve everything. .The starting point is: What does the consumer really want? They want great tasting drinks. And what’s the consequence of some of that? The total food and beverage diet is delivering too many calories and too much sugar. You can get that answer from any health professional. OK. So are we going to tell the consumers what to drink? Are we going to restrict them? We still want to grow our business. But what’s our role in a problem where people are consuming too many calories and too much sugar? We need to get our sugar footprint, for want of a better expression, to go down. .We need the business to grow because if we just sign up to a shrinking business, there’ll be a shareholder revolt. We have to sign up to a growing business with a shrinking sugar footprint. What does that require? Well, it requires us to drive the zero calorie products. It requires us to drive into smaller package sizes. And we need to innovate in drinks that are inherently lower calorie or lower sugar. If we do that, we can actually grow the business and reduce the sugar footprint. .Half our business is away from home. So with the cinemas were closed, the airlines, the hotels, you can see how much it’s down. But what did grow, because people were obliged effectively to spend more time at home, was a resurgence in breakfast. We used to all get up and rush out of apartments to go to work, and many people skip breakfast. Well, now they have more time for it. So juice sales were up.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/james-quincey-coca-cola-corner-office.html
Biden Seeks to Use Infrastructure Plan to Address Racial Inequities,"WASHINGTON — America’s most celebrated infrastructure initiative, the interstate highway system, rammed an elevated freeway through the center of  . in the late 1960s. .It claimed dozens of Black-owned businesses, along with oak trees and azalea bushes that had shaded Black children playing in the large neutral ground in the middle of the street,  . whose residents fought in vain to stop the construction. .More than a half-century later, President Biden’s $2 trillion plan to rebuild aging roads, bridges, rail lines and other foundations of the economy comes with a new twist: hundreds of billions of dollars that administration officials say will help reverse long-running racial disparities in how the government builds, repairs and locates a wide range of physical infrastructure. .That includes $20 billion to “reconnect” communities of color to economic opportunity, like the Black residents still living in the interstate’s shadow along Claiborne. .Mr. Biden’s plan, which he  ., is the first step in a two-part agenda to remake the American economy. The president and his advisers have pitched that agenda — whose total cost could reach $4 trillion — in the grand terms of economic competitiveness and the granular language of shortened commute times. .But they have also stressed its potential to advance racial equity and bridge gaps in economic outcomes. .In addition to dedicated funding for neighborhoods split or splintered by past infrastructure projects, the proposal also includes money for the replacement of lead water pipes that have harmed Black children in cities like Flint, Mich.; the cleanup of environmental hazards that have plagued Hispanic neighborhoods and tribal communities; worker training that would target underserved groups; and funds for home health aides, who are largely women of color. .More traditional efforts to close racial opportunity gaps, like universal pre-K and more affordable higher education, are coming in the next phase of Mr. Biden’s plans. The exact mix of components is likely to change as Mr. Biden tries to push the plans through Congress. .Given the thin Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate, the  . is likely to be intense and highly partisan, with no assurance the White House will prevail. .Republicans have objected to the  . to fund this phase of his agenda, and they have accused the president of using the popular banner of “infrastructure” to sell what they call unrelated liberal priorities — including many of the programs White House officials say will advance economic opportunity for disadvantaged people and areas. .But liberal economists say the spending on transportation, housing and other areas of Mr. Biden’s initial plan could help advance racial equity, if done correctly. .“This is a promising start,” said Trevon Logan, an economist at Ohio State University whose work includes studies of how government spending projects, like the one that built the interstate highway system, have excluded or hurt Americans who are not white.  .The biggest single piece of the plan’s racial equity efforts is not a transportation or environmental project, but a $400 billion investment in in-home care for older and disabled Americans. It would lift the wages of care workers, who are predominantly low-paid, female and not white. .“It’s the first jobs program that is focused primarily on work done by women of color,” said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union. “It’s going to transform Black, brown and Asian lives, and entire communities.” .White House officials say the $100 billion the plan allocates to improve and build out broadband internet will disproportionately help Black and Latino families, who have less access to affordable broadband than white families do. .Half of the $40 billion the plan would spend to upgrade research labs across the country would be reserved for colleges and universities that historically serve Black and other students of color. .Republicans have complained that much of the bill does not fund what they call traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. “Biden’s plan includes hundreds of billions of spending on left-wing policies and blue-state priorities,” the Republican National Committee wrote in a news release, including “$400 billion for an ‘unrelated’ program for home care that ‘was a top demand of some union groups.’” .Mr. Biden has said he wants bipartisan support for the bill but has angered conservatives and businesses with his calls to fund it by raising taxes on corporations. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that Mr. Biden was open to discussing a narrower infrastructure bill with Republicans, although she said the White House has not received a proposal from them. .She declined to say what provisions Mr. Biden might be willing to drop. .“The administration designed this bill with an effort to meet the moment and to do it in a way that ensures we are looking at addressing challenges in our country through a lens of equity,” Ms. Psaki said. .Administration officials say concerns over racial inequality are an animating force of the infrastructure push. They peppered a 25-page explanation of the jobs plan this week with references to racial equity, and they included two specific examples of the sort of communities they hope to lift with the $20 billion for economic revitalization: the Black neighborhood in Syracuse  . to make way for Interstate 81, and the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans. .Government infrastructure spending is meant to make the economy work more efficiently. Freeways and rail lines speed goods from factories to market. Roads and transit systems carry workers from their homes to their jobs. .But for some communities of color, those projects devastated existing economies, leveling commercial corridors, cutting Black neighborhoods off from downtowns and accelerating suburbanization trends that exacerbated segregation. .“A lot of previous government investment in infrastructure purposely excluded these communities,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a deputy director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council. “So if you look at where we need to invest in infrastructure now, a lot of it is concentrated in these communities.” .Past projects were often built in communities that did not have the political capital or resources to successfully protest. .“When it comes time to build an interstate through a city, a pattern emerges: The areas that are displaced by that interstate will overwhelmingly be the areas occupied by African-Americans,” Dr. Logan said. Often, he added, lawmakers choose to build “in the places that have the least political power to make sure this doesn’t happen in their neighborhood.” .Eric Avila, an urban historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, said a consensus during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration on the need to invest in highways that would connect neighborhoods to cities led to the exclusion of minority communities. .The federal government also used “urban renewal” or “slum clearance” redevelopment programs that often led to the clearing of the way for giant infrastructure projects like highways. .“These highways were essentially built as conduits for wealth,” Mr. Avila said. “Primarily white wealth, jobs, people, markets. The highways were built to promote the connectivity between suburbs and cities. The people that were left out were urban minorities. African-Americans, immigrants, Latinos.” .Mr. Avila pointed to how plans for the Inner Belt highway in Cambridge, Mass., were halted after protests by faculty members at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. .And in New Orleans, Mr. Avila said, plans for a highway called the Riverfront Expressway were canceled after officials faced pressure from protesters in the French Quarter. But Black protesters were not able to spare Treme, one of the nation’s oldest communities of free Black residents, from the construction of an elevated six-lane stretch of Interstate 10 along Claiborne Avenue. .Amy Stelly is reminded of that freeway each morning when the truck traffic causes her home to shudder. The emissions from the interstate a block away have turned jewelry that she placed near her window jet black. .“Anyone who lives near an urban highway knows what we’re breathing in every day,” said Ms. Stelly, an urban designer and activist against the project. “There’s a layer of silt that sticks on our properties and houses.” .It is unclear from Mr. Biden’s plan, and conversations with White House officials, what the administration envisions for Claiborne Avenue. If the funding survives in any bill Mr. Biden might sign into law, those details will matter, said Deborah Archer, a director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at New York University School of Law. .“I think it’s wonderful to be able to say and have the goal that this historic investment will advance racial equity,” Ms. Archer said. “It’s another thing to distribute these funds in a way that has impact.”",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/politics/biden-infrastructure-racial-equity.html
"No Federal Taxes for Dozens of Big, Profitable Companies","Just as the Biden administration is pushing to  . on corporations, a new study finds that at least  . last year on billions of dollars in profits. .The  . passed in 2017 by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Donald J. Trump reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. But dozens of Fortune 500 companies were able to further shrink their tax bill — sometimes to zero — thanks to a range of legal deductions and exemptions that have become staples of the tax code, according to the analysis. .Salesforce, Archer-Daniels-Midland and Consolidated Edison were among those named in the report, which was done by the  ., a left-leaning research group in Washington. .Twenty-six of the companies listed, including FedEx, Duke Energy and Nike, were able to avoid paying any federal income tax for the last three years even though they reported a combined income of $77 billion. Many also received millions of dollars in tax rebates. .Companies’ tax returns are private, but publicly traded corporations are required to file  . that include federal income tax expense. The institute used that data along with other information supplied by each company on its pretax income. .Catherine Butler, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, responded in an email that the company “fully complies with federal and state tax laws as part of our efforts to make investments that will benefit our customers and communities.” .She pointed out that the bonus depreciation, intended to encourage investment in areas like renewable energy, “caused Duke’s cash tax obligations to be deferred to future periods, but it did not eliminate them.” According to a filing at the end of 2020, Duke has a deferred federal tax balance of $9 billion that will be paid in the future. .DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility that was also found to have paid no federal taxes for three years, said major investments in modernizing aging infrastructure and new solar and wind technologies were the primary reasons last year. “For utilities, the benefit of these federal tax savings are passed on to utility customers in the form of lower utility bills,” it said in a statement. .A provision in the 2017 tax bill allowed businesses to immediately write off the cost of any new equipment and machinery. .The $2.2 trillion CARES Act, passed last year to help businesses and families survive the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus, also contained a provision that temporarily allowed businesses to use losses in 2020 to offset profits earned in previous years, according to the institute. .DTE used that provision to get an accelerated refund of credits representing $220 million of previously paid alternative minimum taxes, the company said. .FedEx, too, took advantage of provisions in the CARES Act, using losses in 2020 to reduce tax bills from previous years when the tax rate was higher.  .The report is the latest fodder in a debate over whether and how to revise the tax code. Policymakers, business leaders and tax experts argue that many deductions and credits are there for good reason — to encourage research and development, to promote expansion and to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle, taking a longer view of profit and loss than can be calculated in a single year. .“The fact that a lot of companies aren’t paying taxes says there are a lot of provisions and preferences out there,” said Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. “It doesn’t tell you whether they’re good or bad or indifferent. At most it’s a starting point, certainly not an ending point.” .He pointed out that the Biden administration itself supported tax credits for green energy investments. .The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has been issuing a form of its report on corporate taxes for decades. During the 2020 presidential campaign, its findings grabbed center stage, with  . citing it to argue the tax code was deeply flawed. .Tax avoidance strategies include a mix of old standards and new innovations. Companies, for example, saved billions by allowing top executives to buy discounted stock options in the future and then deducting their value as a loss. .The Biden administration announced this week that it planned to  . to 28 percent, and establish a kind of minimum tax that would limit the number of zero-payers. The White House estimated that the revisions would raise $2 trillion over 15 years, which will be used to fund the president’s ambitious  .. .Supporters say that in addition to yielding revenue, the rewrite would help make the tax code more equitable, requiring individuals and companies at the top of the income ladder to pay more. But  . that the tax increases in the Biden proposal — which Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, called “massive” — will preclude bipartisan support. .Referring to the proposed revisions, Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the taxation institute, said, “If I were going to make a list of the things I would want the corporate tax reform to do, this outline tackles all these issues.” .Deductions and exemptions wouldn’t disappear, but other changes like the minimum tax would reduce their value, he said.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/economy/zero-corporate-tax.html

,"Go page by page through Georgia’s new voting law, and one takeaway stands above all others: The Republican legislature and governor have made  ., making absentee voting harder and creating restrictions and complications in the wake of narrow losses to Democrats. .The New York Times has examined and annotated the law, identifying 16 provisions that hamper the right to vote for some Georgians or strip power from state and local elections officials and give it to legislators. .Republicans passed and signed the  . last week following the first Democratic victories in presidential and Senate elections in Georgia in a generation. President Biden won the state by  . out of nearly five million cast. The new law will, in particular, curtail ballot access for voters in booming urban and suburban counties, home to many Democrats. Another provision makes it a crime to offer water to voters waiting in lines, which tend to be longer in densely populated communities. .Below is The Times’s analysis of the law, including the specific provisions and some struck-through language from the state’s previous voting legislation. .Georgia has cut by more than half the period during which voters may request an absentee ballot, from nearly six months before an election to less than three. .This will almost certainly reduce the number of people who seek absentee ballots and the number of people who vote.  ., 1.3 million Georgians — about 26 percent of the state’s electorate — voted with absentee ballots. Of those who returned absentee ballots in 2020, 65 percent voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 34 percent chose Donald J. Trump. .The shorter window will also limit opportunities for get-out-the-vote efforts and could put greater strain on local election boards, which will have less time to process ballot requests. .Previously, Georgia law required voters to simply sign their absentee ballot applications. Now they will have to provide the number from a driver’s license or an equivalent state-issued identification. This is virtually certain to limit access to absentee voting. .The law also creates pitfalls for voters: If they fail to follow all the new steps, like printing a date of birth or in some cases including partial Social Security numbers, their ballots could be tossed out. Mr. Trump’s lawyers and allies urged judges and Republican officials last year to invalidate some ballots that were out of compliance. Stringent voter-ID laws in other states have depressed voting mostly among people of color. .When the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, mailed absentee ballot applications to every registered voter in the state ahead of its June primary election. This led to absentee voting by record numbers of Georgians. .When Mr. Raffensperger didn’t mail applications again for the general election, several local government agencies did so, particularly in Georgia’s large urban counties — a move that the state has now made illegal. With the loss of automatically mailed applications, some voters will invariably not request ballots, since the applications also served as a reminder to people that they were eligible to vote. .The new law also forbids third-party groups to prefill applications for voters, which made applying for an absentee ballot easier for many voters. .For the 2020 election, there were 94 drop boxes across the four counties that make up the core of metropolitan Atlanta: Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett. The new law limits the same four counties to a total of, at most, 23 drop boxes, based on  .. The number could be lower depending on how many early-voting sites the counties provide. .There won’t just be fewer drop boxes. Instead of 24-hour access outdoors, the boxes must be placed indoors at government buildings and early-voting sites and will thus be unavailable for voters to drop off their ballots during evenings and other nonbusiness hours. .The measure is likely to have the effect of pushing absentee voters to return ballots through the mail, which in 2020  . as in the past because of cuts to the Postal Service. .Last year, Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, had  . during the early voting periods, effectively bringing polling sites to people at churches, parks and public libraries. In the November election, more than 11,200 people voted at the two vehicles in Fulton County. .Georgia has now outlawed this practice, unless the governor declares a state of emergency to allow it — something that Mr. Kemp, a Republican, is unlikely to do given that it could increase voter turnout in Atlanta. .These new strict rules on early voting hours are likely to curtail voting access for Georgians who work daytime hours or have less flexible schedules and who may be unable to return an absentee ballot. .The provision requires counties to hold early voting during weekday working hours — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — and says it may be held for longer but may not take place before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on those days. The early voting period will begin four weeks before an election. The previous iteration of the law called only for early voting during “normal business hours” and left it up to counties to determine those hours. .The provision also adds a second required Saturday of early voting (the previous law required only one), which will increase access to early voting in most of the state’s rural counties, where election administrators have often been short-staffed and have offered fewer hours of early voting. Most larger counties in the state already offered multiple weekend days of early voting. .The law doesn’t require the availability of early voting on Sundays, which means that counties can choose whether to open for early voting on up to two Sundays before an election. .Counties that choose not to open on Sundays would be limiting ballot access for parishioners at Black churches that have  . after Sunday services. .Perhaps no provision in the Georgia law has received more attention than this one, which effectively bars third-party groups or anyone else who is not an election worker from providing food and water to voters waiting in line. Republicans defended the provision, saying it is enforceable only within a 150-foot radius of polling places. Civil rights groups note that it also prevents assistance “within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place.” .Long lines for voting in Georgia are an unfortunate reality, and are often found in the poorer, densely populated communities that tend to vote Democratic. During the primary election last June, when temperatures hovered above 80 degrees with high humidity, multiple voting locations across the state  .. .Numerous studies have shown that long lines deter people from voting. According to  ., an independent research group, over 560,000 voters did not cast ballots in 2016 “because of problems related to polling place management, including long lines.” In 2014, Stephen Pettigrew, then a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s department of government,  . found that more than 200,000 voters did not vote in the midterm elections that year because they had faced long lines during the 2012 election. .The new law does make it clear that it is legal for voters to drink from a water fountain, if one exists along the line to vote and provided they get the water themselves. .From 2012 to 2018, Georgia shuttered more than 214 voting precincts around the state, according to  .. Those changes, many of which followed the Supreme Court’s  . in 2013, confused many voters, who upon showing up to the wrong precinct had to vote with provisional ballots. .This provision removes even that remedy for voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m., requiring them to instead travel to the correct precinct or risk being disenfranchised. .Casting a provisional ballot after showing up at the wrong precinct was by far the most common reason for voting provisionally in the 2020 election in Georgia; roughly 44 percent of provisional ballots in the state were from “out of precinct voters,”  .. And in Fulton County,  . were from “out of precinct” voters. .Of the  . that were counted in the 2020 presidential election, Mr. Biden won 64 percent and Mr. Trump took 34 percent. .This is a small change, but it could have a significant impact on whether voting hours can be extended in the event of a problem. .Previously, a judge could order that a precinct stay open for as long as necessary based on a problem that had hindered voting (for example, if power went out for 30 minutes, the judge could add an hour of balloting at the end of the day). The new provision requires any relief period to match exactly the amount of time that people were unable to vote. .Georgia is no stranger to Election Day mishaps and problems. Its primary last June was marred by hourslong lines caused by malfunctioning machines. Some precincts had no choice but to ask every voter to file a provisional ballot. Other precincts stayed open later into the night. .Under the new law, if similar election problems were to occur, voters who had to leave would have less time to come back later. .One key factor in how widely Mr. Trump and his allies were able to spread falsehoods about the 2020 election was that it took more than two weeks for news outlets to declare that President Biden had won Georgia. With such a long delay, Republicans successfully sowed doubts about the election’s validity by baselessly arguing that fraud must have taken place. .Georgia Republicans’ new voting law does allow the absentee ballot counting process to begin much earlier, with local clerks allowed to open and inspect absentee ballots three weeks before an election. .Still, no ballots can be counted until the polls close, meaning the process of tabulating and reporting vote totals is likely to be lengthy for high-turnout contests. That could lead future candidates to follow Mr. Trump’s lead in trying to contest the results of a legitimate election. .Last year, as election officials faced countless challenges trying to hold voting during a pandemic, funding for the November general election became tied up in  . over the second stimulus package. .Many local election jurisdictions in Georgia and other states, particularly those in poorer urban areas, turned to outside philanthropic groups like the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit organization funded by Mark Zuckerberg that helped counties pay for their elections in 2020. Now Georgia has eliminated that option. .Conspiracy theories in right-wing circles have long focused on the specter of nefarious outsiders swaying election operations with donations; the theories often involve anti-Semitic falsehoods about George Soros, the billionaire liberal donor, who is also Jewish. .Complaints about possible voter intimidation and fraud had previously been run through a web of county election officials and the secretary of state before reaching the state attorney general, but this provision centralizes them and deputizes the attorney general to handle them. .Placing that responsibility within the attorney general’s office may help remove partisan influence to actions that are taken in response to complaints, but voting rights groups say it could serve as an intimidation tactic. And attorneys general themselves could bring their own partisan influence. .This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role. .The law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general. .The provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions. .But it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims. .This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board. .Viewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud. .Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement. .Now the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election. .The law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections. .In the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement. .Georgia has had its fair share of runoff elections recently; both of its newly seated Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, prevailed in such contests. The shortening of the runoff election window, which Republicans say was meant to help election administrators, could also end up overburdening them, forcing a quick turnaround to hold a runoff election even as officials are still working to certify and ratify the initial general election vote. .Shortening the runoff time will also affect both early voting and military and overseas voters. While the bill states that early voting for a runoff should begin “as early as possible,” it does not specifically require weekend voting. .Additionally, federal election law states that ballots for military and overseas voters must be mailed out 45 days before an election, so those voters will now receive ranked-choice general-election ballots rather than second, separate ballots for the runoff.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html
"The Pandemic Hit the Working Class Hard. The Colleges That Serve Them Are Hurting, Too.","The coronavirus pandemic has been uniquely hard on America’s working class, causing  . among people without college degrees and eliminating low-wage jobs by the millions. Now, the education system created to help those very workers also is in jeopardy. .Colleges of all types are struggling under the shadow of the  ., but the nation’s community college system has been disproportionately hurt, with tens of thousands of students being forced to delay school or drop out because of the pandemic and the economic crisis it has created. .Enrollment is down by 9.5 percent at the more than 1,000 two-year colleges in the United States compared with numbers from last spring, according to figures from the  ., a nonprofit organization that found a similar drop last fall. That is more than double the loss experienced by four-year schools. .Community college enrollment among Black and Hispanic students has declined even more sharply, with a 19 percent drop from fall 2019 to fall 2020 among Black students and a 16 percent drop among Hispanic students. Of the nation’s five million students enrolled at community colleges, about 40 percent are Black or Latino and nearly half are low-income, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. .“Many of our students come to college with challenges,” said Tracy D. Hall, president of Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis. “Now you add a pandemic to that, it just exacerbates it.” .Community colleges, a vast majority of which are state-run schools, have historically provided a low-cost alternative for students who lack financial backing from their parents or academic preparation for four-year colleges. They also are a critical training ground for students seeking jobs in local businesses, from auto mechanics and welders to dental hygienists. About 27 percent of the nation’s more than 17 million college students are enrolled in two-year programs. .President Biden, whose wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is a professor at a community college, has cited the importance of community colleges to educational equity. In the coming weeks, he is expected to propose making  . as part of the  . that he  .. .By arranging free tuition for many, though possibly not all, students, the Biden plan would also free up other forms of federal aid to low-income students, such as Pell Grants, to pay for things like housing, food or books, according to congressional aides who have been briefed on aspects of the proposal.  . are often cited as major reasons for low-income students to drop out of college. .Over all, community colleges in Tennessee have lost about 10 percent of their total enrollment, mirroring the national figures. Southwest, a two-year public school with seven locations in the western part of the state, has lost 19 percent of its enrollment in the past year, making it one of the most profoundly affected of Tennessee’s 13 community colleges. .At Southwest, about 800 Black men have paused their studies. Now there is concern that the pandemic will permanently derail their educational paths, along with low-income and minority students across the country — potentially deepening educational inequities with white students. .“It’s depressing,” said Russ Deaton, executive vice chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, which oversees community colleges in the state. “A lot of the students we’ve lost were loosely tethered to higher education anyway. It didn’t take much to push them out of the education path.” .Many community college students are adults — the average age is 28 — and even before the pandemic, they struggled to stay in school, juggling academic work with financial pressures, child care needs and even homelessness.  . showed that at least 40 percent of students at community colleges left school before earning a certificate or degree. .For these students, the pandemic upset an already difficult balancing act, leaving many just plain exhausted. For Corey Ray Baranowski — a 33-year-old father of five children, age 5 months to 11 years old — the breaking point came last year. .Before the health crisis, Mr. Baranowski and his wife juggled their large family, several jobs and studies at Jackson State Community College, another school that was hit hard by the pandemic, in Jackson, Tenn., 90 miles northeast of Memphis. .The dominoes started tumbling last spring, when the pandemic reached his small community of Lexington, Tenn. .First, the school system where both Mr. Baranowski and his wife, a photographer, had worked as substitute teachers shut down. Then, that same day, their three school-age children were sent home to learn remotely. Their community college also suspended in-person classes. .“It was unsettling,” Mr. Baranowski recalled. He and his wife, then expecting their fifth child, struggled to keep up their own schoolwork while making sure the children did theirs, overloading the family’s home computer capacity — and their multitasking skills. .“There were some bologna sandwiches and peanut butter and jelly going on, trying to manage money,” Mr. Baranowski said. Overwhelmed, he dropped two classes last spring and decided not to re-enroll this year. .But in August, Mr. Baranowski found a job at a juvenile correctional center. The couple hopes to return to college next fall. .“My goal is to graduate and become a teacher,” he said. .As George Pimentel, the president of Jackson State, puts it, “Many of our students have just hit the pause button.” .Community colleges normally lose students during boom times when jobs are plentiful, then see enrollment increase during economic downturns as unemployed people seek training for new careers — as happened after the recession of 2009. .So why is there currently an enrollment bust during a downturn? One theory is that the relief packages enacted by Congress, combined with the hope that jobs will return swiftly once the pandemic is over, have made those who are unemployed less apt to enroll in community colleges to retrain for new careers. .“There’s always been a sense that jobs are going to come back as soon as the numbers go down, so why would you start a degree program?” said Doug Shapiro, executive research director for the National Student Clearinghouse. .Another theory is that many of the skills taught at community colleges do not transfer well to online teaching formats. Rushton W. Johnson, vice president of student affairs at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., which has had a 15 percent enrollment decline since last spring, says the pandemic was a “perfect storm” for community colleges. .“It’s impossible to learn to weld, drive a truck, cook, draw blood, wire a network online, without handling the equipment and tools,” Mr. Johnson said. .While many low-income students in Tennessee can attend community college tuition-free by using federal and state grants, job disruptions have made it difficult for many to pay for basic living expenses. .Last spring, Katie Dollar, 25, could no longer afford rent when the game arcade where she was working closed because of the pandemic. She packed up and returned home to live with her father, with plans to continue her studies at Pellissippi online. .But the balky satellite internet service at her father’s rural Tennessee farm made it impossible for her to participate in remote classes. “Livestreaming classes was not an option,” Ms. Dollar, a theater student, said. .She decided not to enroll in the fall, but she is back in school this semester after landing a job at a Trader Joe’s and a new apartment. .Enrollment declines have been particularly steep among first-year students who have never attended college at all, including high school graduates of 2020. Freshmen enrollment dropped by 19 percent at community colleges in Tennessee. .The pandemic has also blown a hole in community college budgets, forcing layoffs in some cases. The financial hit to community colleges has been exacerbated by state funding cuts aimed disproportionately at two-year colleges, according to  . by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. Southwest is facing a budget shortfall — more than $10 million — and is hoping to be rescued with funds from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed this month by Mr. Biden. .Of the nearly $40 billion that is allocated for colleges in the bill, an estimated $12.7 billion will go to community colleges, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. .With its main campuses in Memphis, a predominantly Black city, Southwest is expected to receive about $12 million from the stimulus package. .Dr. Deaton, of the Tennessee Board of Regents, said that aggressive outreach to students could be the key to encouraging many of them to re-enroll. Community colleges throughout the state are already working to lure back the students who had their education disrupted by the pandemic. .Southwest has begun such outreach, convincing 80 Black male students to return. It also purchased 3,500 laptops for students, installed wireless internet coverage in a parking lot and provided hot spots in some homes to encourage students to stay enrolled. .But Southwest has yet to persuade Charles Moore to come back. .A year ago, Mr. Moore, 20, was supporting himself by waiting tables while studying criminal justice at Southwest. Then the coronavirus spread to the United States and his plans for a college degree fell apart. .First his employer, the Olive Garden, laid him off. When his campus shut down and shifted to remote classes, he struggled to adapt to learning online. He was able to get a new job in security, but it required him to commute into Mississippi, leaving him little time to do his schoolwork. In May, he dropped out. .Mr. Moore says he wants to be a sheriff’s deputy, a job that does not require a college degree. So amid the uncertainty and unpredictability of the pandemic, he has made no immediate plans to return to school. .But he still thinks about campus life, about being exposed to new people and ideas, about getting “that college experience.” .“It felt like I was headed toward something,” he said.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/covid-19-colleges.html
‘Here We Go Baby’: Francisco Lindor Truly Commits to the Mets,"WASHINGTON — Unable to contain his jubilation, Francisco Lindor unleashed a short celebratory scream in his hotel room late Wednesday when his agent informed him that the Mets had agreed to give him a franchise record 10-year, $341 million contract extension. .Shortly after, as Lindor told his father about his brief outburst and suggested he wanted to yell even more, Miguel Lindor urged his son to practice decorum and not to make a racket in the hotel. .No chance of that. And the only way Francisco Lindor, 27, could make his father understand how impossible it would have been to remain quiet at such a moment was to make a comparison an average person might be able to grasp. .“You know when you drive down the highway and you see a billboard for the Powerball that says $300 million?” Lindor, the Mets’ gifted shortstop, told reporters on a video conference call on Thursday. “Imagine you getting that right now. You are going to tell me you aren’t going to scream? I am going to scream. I want to scream. I’ve been working for years my whole entire life.” .After several days of high-stakes negotiations, Lindor hit baseball’s lottery when team owner Steven Cohen agreed to sign Lindor to the largest contract the Mets have ever given to a player, a deal worth $1 million more than the 14-year contract San Diego Padres shortstop Fernando Tatis, 22, agreed to in February. .Lindor’s extension, which includes a limited no-trade clause, kicks in after this season. He was already set to earn $22.3 million this season, and this extension commits him to the Mets through 2031. .“I’m humbled by this opportunity to be in this organization for the next 11 years,” said Lindor, who was drafted by Cleveland in 2011. “It’s an honor, it’s a privilege to wear blue and orange.” .But for a couple of days it felt as if it might not happen. Lindor, whom the Mets acquired from Cleveland in  ., and the Mets reached the agreement less than 24 hours before a Thursday deadline that Lindor had set at the time of the trade. Missing that deadline of opening day would ostensibly have halted negotiations until after the season, when Lindor would have entertained offers from any of the other 29 teams. .But with the deal in place, Lindor enters a new season without the pressure to perform well enough to earn over a third of a billion dollars in free agency. He also avoids the possibility of being thrown into a glutted shortstop market with several other excellent players, like Houston’s Carlos Correa, the Chicago Cubs’ Javier Baez, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Corey Seager and Colorado’s Trevor Story, each of whom will potentially hit free agency at the same time. .For some players, the pressure of producing a strong statistical year ahead of free agency can result in a substandard season. But Lindor said he always felt the pressure to perform, regardless of his contract status. .“The need to put up great numbers? That’s there every year,” he said, “Whether it was rookie season, sophomore season, third year, fourth and so on. I want to put up good numbers to win. I want to win. If I put up good numbers I give my team a chance to win.” .Indeed, Lindor had already put up some of the best numbers in baseball at any position in his six seasons with Cleveland, and the contract demonstrated that the Mets see him as a foundational player for the next decade, ready to take his place among  .. .Not only is he a brilliant defensive shortstop, but he hit at least 32 home runs and 40 doubles in each of the three full seasons before the pandemic and he scored at least 99 runs in each of his last four full seasons. He also has more home runs (111) and extra base hits (258) than any other shortstop over the last four seasons. .Although he has not yet played a real game for the Mets — Thursday’s scheduled season opener  . because the Washington Nationals had a coronavirus outbreak — Lindor said he felt comfortable enough with the team during spring training to commit to them, and feels the Mets have a core group of players that are good enough to compete for a championship, especially with the Mets now able to rely on Cohen’s financial resources backing the operation. .Lindor added that he was not bothered by any of Cohen’s comments on his Twitter account during the final days of negotiations, especially when the talks appeared to have stalled. Cohen had written that he would crowdsource suggestions for how much to pay Lindor, and later said that he hoped Lindor would sign on with the Mets for what at that time appeared to be the team’s final offer of $325 million. .“The crowdsource one, that was funny, that was a funny one,” Lindor said. “I told them at dinner. The other ones, at that point I already shut down my phone and everything on social media. So, I didn’t really care too much for it, because at that point it was like, ‘All right, we’re either going to get this done or not.’” .After the deal was finalized, Lindor said he spent the rest of the night alone in his room, calling his fiancée — whom he described as “nervous” about moving to a big city like New York — his close friends in and out of the game, and family members, especially his father, who helped teach Lindor how to play baseball with grueling drills when the son was a kid. .Lindor is very close to his father and said that no matter how much money he makes, his father’s stern example and high standards will ensure that Lindor will always work as hard as he can. .“It is possible that a little kid from Puerto Rico, that wasn’t the best in school, that wasn’t the most fluent talking, that came to the States not knowing the language, that stayed in a hotel with his stepmom, his dad his stepsister and his little sister in one hotel room with just a microwave. Look where I am today.” .When Lindor was asked if he had any messages for supporters of the Mets now that the deal was completed, he flashed that signature smile that has earned him the nickname, Mr. Smile. .“Here we go, baby,” he said. “We have 11 years together.” .For Mets fans who have waited over a decade for their team to sign a huge contract for a marquee superstar, those words could be enough to make some of them scream out, too.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/francisco-lindor-mets-extension.html
,"Saul Malek grew up surrounded by sports. .He played soccer and Little League, and shot hoops at the neighborhood court. He was obsessed with the Houston Astros. When they won, he was ecstatic. Once when they lost, he whipped a belt at a wall so hard he chipped the paint. .Mr. Malek joined a fantasy baseball league while in middle school. In college, an acquaintance connected him with a bookie. Winning his first bet — $10 that the Royals would beat the Blue Jays — made him feel “like a big shot,” he said. .But he soon found that he needed “nonstop action.” He would find an online sports book and maybe win enough to pay a former bookie back. More often, though, he’d lose. Then he would block the bookie’s number, find a new sports book and repeat. .His parents bailed him out for hundreds of dollars several times, but he didn’t seek help until he “felt physically uncomfortable” one night after not placing a bet in time. He realized he didn’t have any close relationships left. .Mr. Malek, now 23 and living in Houston, said he had never considered that sports betting could escalate to an addiction that would lead him to lie, cheat and manipulate people for money. And yet he has come to have plenty of company as policy shifts and technological advances have made it easier than ever to wager money on sports. .Analysts and recovery advocates worry that efforts to research the long-term implications of legal sports betting and warn participants about the risks for addiction are falling short, particularly for people in their late teens and early 20s who are most vulnerable. .“We’re now in a phase where the nation has an appetite for sports betting,” said Dr. Timothy Fong, a professor of psychiatry with specialty in addiction at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s created this new form of entertainment that society has approved, but that form of entertainment does have a potential for addiction.” .Long restricted to Nevada, sports betting expanded rapidly after the Supreme Court overturned federal prohibitions against it in 2018. It is now  . In many states, people can legally and conveniently wager money using their smartphones, betting on point spreads or results, or placing so-called proposition bets on events like the coin toss or which color of Gatorade will be dumped on the winning coach. .Americans wagered $13 billion on sports with legal operators in 2019, according to the  ., the industry’s trade group, with popular events like the Super Bowl whipping bettors into a frenzy. The Gaming Association expects  ., which reach a climax with the Final Four stage for the women on Friday and the men on Saturday. .Most adults who bet on sports do so without major negative consequences. But about 1 percent of American adults have a gambling disorder, in which the core symptom is continuing to gamble despite harmful consequences, said Dr. Fong, who is a director of the Gambling Studies Program at U.C.L.A.  .A vast majority of those with a serious gambling problem never seek or gain access to treatment, he said. . that sports bettors are typically male, under 35, single, educated and employed or preparing for a career. According to a new survey commissioned by the National Council on Problem Gambling, sports bettors showed significantly higher levels of problematic gambling than other gamblers. The risk of addiction is higher for young adults — specifically sports bettors — than for those of any other age, the survey found. .According to  ., a subgroup of the International Center for Responsible Gaming, 6 percent of college students in the United States have a serious gambling problem that can lead to psychological difficulties, unmanageable debt and failing grades. .Young adults are at particular risk for developing a gambling problem, especially if there is a family history of gambling or if they are introduced to it at a young age, Dr. Fong said. The increased accessibility of online gambling may accelerate the development of problems, he said — a phenomenon known as  .. .As sports betting has grown — household names like FanDuel and DraftKings now offer legal avenues — the need for recovery programs and dedicated treatment facilities has quickly outpaced their availability, recovery experts said. Rick Benson, the founder of the Algamus Gambling Recovery Center in Arizona, said the number of young adults who have sought treatment for gambling problems has more than doubled in the past two years. .Sex, drugs and alcohol are commonly covered in school and in the coming-of-age conversations that parents have with their children, but discussions about the consequences of gambling are rare, former gamblers and experts said. This can lead young people to underestimate the addictive nature of sports betting and other forms of gambling. Warnings, often in small fonts, that caution visitors to online sports books and gambling websites about the risks of addiction are easily overlooked. .“You can do it 24/7 from right on your phone,” said one recovered gambling addict, a 38-year-old man who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was about to embark on a job search. .“It’s really, really dangerous,” he said, noting he had contacted a few websites during his recovery and asked to be blocked, but they had allowed him to reopen his accounts after he relapsed. .Over the last 30 years in the United States, there has been a shift in the cultural perception of gambling, said Keith Whyte, director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, a research and advocacy group. Once viewed as a vice, sports betting in particular has become more widely accepted as a form of entertainment and as a new source of tax revenue for the states that have legalized it, he said. .“It’s now become a positive element of state, financial or economic policy. But it’s also addictive, and therein lies the rub,” said Mr. Whyte, whose organization is neutral on the legalization of gambling. “It’s the only addictive service or product where a state government is so heavily involved.” .But when people become addicted, the blame often falls on the individual rather than on an industry whose advertising and marketing, including bonuses and risk-free trials, are targeted to young men. .More than half of adults  . attributed gambling problems “at least in part to moral weakness or lack of willpower,” and fewer than half said they believed a medical or a genetic condition played a role. Half of those surveyed said “people with a gambling problem are to blame for their problems.” .“It’s still seen as a moral failing rather than a medical disorder,” Mr. Whyte said. “Americans have made that connection with drugs and alcohol, but they haven’t made that connection yet for gambling.” .According to the  ., $4.4 billion was wagered with legal sports books across the country in January, the sixth consecutive month in which a “national handle record” was broken. The  . took in nearly $908.9 million in sports betting revenue from more than $13 billion in wagers in 2019, more than double the $430.7 million in revenue they collected in 2018. .The states that authorized gambling on sports as a new source of revenue and jobs “are also the ones who are supposed to be protecting their citizens from the adverse effects they’re talking about,” Mr. Whyte said. “They’re supposed to be balancing the costs and benefits.” .Many young adults have embraced gambling and sports betting as new social traditions. There are March Madness brackets, poker nights and casino fund-raisers for fraternities and sororities. .“It’s just so accepted, so acceptable, it makes it just so easy to get involved with,” Mr. Malek said. “It’s advertised as a normal part of being, like, a 20-year-old guy: Make some money, make some sports bets, make your fantasy team — whatever. It’s just cool.” .Mr. Malek said his struggle with addiction motivated him to pursue a master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He discusses his addiction openly with the hope that doing so will sound an alarm about how quickly and easily dabbling in sports betting can lead to disaster. .He recalled the older participants in the 12-step program he completed sharing stories of reading the newspaper to find out the scores of games from the night before, and calling their bookies on the phone. .“I think that the industry of sports betting is definitely evolving, which is scary for the public,” Mr. Malek said. “You’re always clicks away from it anytime you want it. It’s out there 24/7. I don’t think that people are aware of how devastating the consequences of this will be.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/sports-betting-addiction.html
The Sabres’ Losing Streak Ends at 18,"The Buffalo Sabres started the year seeking to ignite their offense with new acquisitions, but instead they found ignominy with a historic losing streak. .The Sabres lost 18 games in a row before slamming the brakes on their skid with a resounding 6-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday. .Those 18 losses matched those accumulated by the 2003-4 Pittsburgh Penguins, who previously had the undesirable distinction of having lost more games consecutively than any other team. .Goalie Linus Ullmark had 31 saves, and defenseman Brandon Montour blew the contest open with an empty-net goal and then a superb individual effort that gave him two short-handed scores in the span of 37 seconds as the Sabres tightened their grip on the game late. .“You never want to lose,” said Montour, who praised his team’s positivity through the streak. “Especially the streak we had there, everybody was talking about it, there was always something to say.” .Injuries have played a role: Buffalo was without the scoring forward Jack Eichel, who last played on March 7, toward the middle of the slump. .Without Eichel, their captain, the Sabres sought leadership by committee, and many players were vocal on Wednesday, Don Granato, the interim coach, said. The team had squandered a three-goal lead against Philadelphia in the third period on Monday, so Granato allowed his players to speak during the second intermission rather than making strategic adjustments or offering his own thoughts. .“We thought it was best just to hand it to them,” Granato said. “It’s your third period, not ours, and you know what to do.” .What they did was end a slide that had lasted more than a month. Here are some of the highlights: .The losing streak (0-15-3), which began on Feb. 25 with an overtime loss to the Devils, was equal parts woe and “whoa,” as the Sabres were abjectly bad at times and imaginatively so at others. .The Sabres nearly broke their free fall on Monday, when they took a 3-0 lead at home against the Flyers. But the Flyers evened the score in the third period before defenseman Ivan Provorov capped Philadelphia’s comeback with a goal 42 seconds into overtime. .“We haven’t been in this situation — we got panicked,” defenseman Rasmus Dahlin said in a video news conference. “The puck bounces their way, and — I don’t know.” .Montour was even more blunt in his assessment, saying that any team in the N.H.L. should have won a game it had led by 3-0, much less a team as desperate for a victory as Buffalo. .Whether or not that was the nadir of the streak may be a matter of debate. .The Sabres closed February by being shut out in back-to-back games against Philadelphia, another of the worst defensive teams this season. .Between March 4 and March 11, the Sabres allowed five goals in each of five consecutive games, which was as close as they had come to defensive consistency. .They followed that up with two more shutout losses, falling to the to the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals by an aggregate score of 9-0. They were shut out five times over all and were outscored, 75-30, as they plummeted to the bottom of the league standings. .The disparities between eras make the official record-keeping and bar-stool arguments a bit messy. .Starting with the implementation of the shootout in the 2005-6 season, the N.H.L. eliminated ties. The 2003-4 Penguins, who also lost 18 in a row (0-17-1), played in the final season before shootouts, but the league had a system, as it does today, that awarded teams a point in the standings for reaching overtime even if they lost. .Technically, the N.H.L. considers overtime losses and shootout losses to be equivalent to ties for historical purposes, as any of the three results would yield a point in the standings. Furthermore, for much of the league’s history, any game that would have gone to overtime or a shootout under current rules would have instead ended in a tie, as there was no regular-season overtime period between 1942 and 1983. .In ., the longest losing streaks, at 17 regulation games, belong to the 1974-75 Washington Capitals and the 1992-93 San Jose Sharks. The Sabres’ longest string of regulation losses was nine, and the 18 straight defeats are considered a “winless streak.” .The  . belongs to the Winnipeg Jets franchise, today’s Arizona Coyotes. They were the class of the World Hockey Association, as the only franchise to win three Avco Cups, but their early days in the N.H.L. were dreadful. In 1980-81, their second N.H.L. campaign, they went winless for 30 games, losing 23 and tying seven times. .But there seems to be little question that the Sabres’ slump will bring further infamy to a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2011, hasn’t won a postseason series since 2007, hasn’t made the finals since 1999 and has never won the Stanley Cup over its 50-season history. .The Sabres made an outside-the-box coaching hire before last season by selecting Ralph Krueger, who had coached the Edmonton Oilers in 2012-13 but had spent the previous five years as the chairman of an English Premier League soccer club. The team fired him on March 17, when the skid had reached a dozen losses, and made Granato the interim coach. Krueger had taken over a team that started strong in 2018-19 and then did so again under him in 2019-20, only to fall off as those campaigns progressed. .Before this season, they had hoped to make the most of an offense that already featured top picks turned stars like Eichel and Dahlin. They added Taylor Hall, the most sought-after forward in free agency and the 2018 most valuable player, on a one-year contract. They also traded for the veteran center Eric Staal, who led the Carolina Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup victory and scored 100 points in 2006 and experienced a resurgence with the Minnesota Wild. .The day Krueger was fired, General Manager Kevyn Adams all but heaved Hall onto the trade block. Staal was traded nine days later, with 50 percent of his remaining salary retained, in exchange for two middle-round draft picks. .No Sabre who has played in at least 15 games this season has a positive plus-minus rating, and as of Wednesday evening, the four worst ratings in the N.H.L. belonged to Buffalo players, including Dahlin’s league-worst negative 33. Staal and Hall combined for 28 points, while the production of Dahlin and another offensive-minded defenseman, Rasmus Ristolainen, has also flagged considerably. .The former all-star wingers Jeff Skinner and Kyle Okposo have combined for a meager 13 points this season, despite counting for $15 million and around 18 percent of the salary cap. Okposo has been hindered by health issues, but Skinner’s even more underwhelming performance has come two seasons after he scored 40 goals for the Sabres. .As a team, Buffalo is tied with the Anaheim Ducks and the Devils for the second-fewest goals scored and is near the bottom in goals allowed.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/hockey/sabres-losing-streak-ends.html
,"WASHINGTON — Major League Baseball sailed through roughly six weeks of spring training without any major coronavirus disruptions, but just hours before first pitches were set to be thrown across the country, the problem lurched up again. .The Mets’ season-opening game against the Washington Nationals was postponed on Thursday because of at least three positive coronavirus tests among the Nationals players and because several other players were determined to have been close contacts with the initial individual who tested positive, which requires them to be isolated as well. .M.L.B. issued a statement Thursday saying that the game was postponed “because of ongoing contact tracing involving members of the Nationals organization. Out of an abundance of caution, the game will not be made up on Friday.” .The delay means the Mets and their fans will have to wait at least a few more days to see Francisco Lindor, their new superstar shortstop who just agreed to a  ., make his Mets debut. .Mets Manager Luis Rojas said he was “pretty optimistic” the game would be played Saturday. .“This is not a surprise,” Rojas said. “We have been in situations like this last year. Health is still the No. 1 thing in the world. We are taking care of ourselves and everyone is still wearing their masks everywhere and we are doing what we need to do to make sure that we are protecting each other.” .Jacob deGrom of the Mets had been slated to start Thursday’s game against Max Scherzer of the Nationals in a matchup of Cy Young Award winners. They will likely keep those assignments for whenever the game ends up being played. .On Wednesday, Mike Rizzo, Washington’s general manager, said that five players and one staff member were already ruled out of Thursday’s game. On Thursday, Rizzo confirmed that there were at least three positive tests and one other that is likely to end up as a positive. .The original positive test came from a round of testing done on Monday, the last day of spring training for the Nationals. Following that game, the team flew back to Washington. Rizzo said he was alerted to the positive test after 1 a.m. on Wednesday. .Last year, dozens of games were postponed after outbreaks on various teams, resulting in complicated rescheduling plans, with many teams playing multiple doubleheaders across the sport. This year, M.L.B. had wanted to postpone the season a month to allow more time for players and staff members to get vaccinated and for virus infection rates to drop around the country, but were unable to gain approval of the plan from the players’ union. .M.L.B. has offered to relax coronavirus restrictions on teams once 85 percent of players and staff members are fully vaccinated.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/mets-nationals-postponed-coronavirus.html
"Bibian Mentel, Champion Paralympic Snowboarder, Dies at 48","Bibian Mentel, a champion Dutch snowboarder who lost her lower right leg to cancer, then returned to the sport a few months later and dominated it for the next 16 years, died on Monday at her home in Loosdrecht, the Netherlands. She was 48. .After losing her leg, Ms. Mentel had continued to struggle with cancer throughout her career, and in March she announced that it had spread to her brain and was inoperable. Her death was confirmed by a representative of her nonprofit organization,  .. .Ms. Mentel, a steely-eyed competitor who won gold medals at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Paralympic Games, was widely considered among the best snowboarders in the world. She was also a celebrity in the Netherlands, where her athletic achievements, inspirational life story and natural sense of poise and glamour made her the subject of fashion-magazine cover articles and television profiles. .“Thank you for everything you have given and shared with us,” Prince Constantijn, the younger brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands,  .. “Everyone you touched with your optimism and persistence has become a better person.” .Ms. Mentel was already a six-time Dutch champion in the halfpipe and snowboard cross events when she injured her right ankle while training for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Doctors found a tumor on her tibia — a recurrence of a cancer that had first appeared in 1999. They removed her right leg below her knee in 2001. .She was told she wouldn’t snowboard again. But she was soon back on the slopes, and seven months after her surgery she won a gold medal at the Dutch snowboarding championships. .Ms. Mentel continued to compete, and win, in para snowboarding events, even as her cancer reappeared in 2004, this time in her lungs. Over the next 11 years doctors performed five operations, each time removing a bit of lung. .She joined several other para snowboarders in successfully lobbying the International Paralympic Committee to add their sport to the Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She carried the flag for the Netherlands at the opening ceremony and captured a gold medal in snowboard cross. .Her cancer returned in 2016; this time doctors said there was nothing they could do. She went home and told her husband, Edwin Spee, and her children that she would die soon. Mr. Spee began searching for alternatives, and soon found a doctor with an advanced treatment. .It worked, but the next year doctors found cancer yet again, this time in her neck. Though they were able to push it into remission, the treatment greatly weakened her neck vertebrae, and one of them had to be replaced with a titanium prosthesis — “my permanent jewelry,” she would joke. .The back-to-back bouts with cancer kept her out of competition for many months, and most of her sponsors dropped her. She had to rely on crowdfunding to get to the 2018 Winter Paralympic Games, in Pyeongchang, South Korea. .Once again she carried the Dutch flag in the opening ceremony, and once again she won gold — twice, in the banked slalom and again in snowboard cross. .“I heard a rumor that she has 128 gold medals in her house, and I don’t think that’s an exaggeration,” said Amy Purdy, an American para snowboarder, in  . with Ms. Mentel. “I have traveled the world and competed with her for my entire snowboarding career, and she has won gold every single time.” .Bibian Karina Mentel was born on Sept. 27, 1972, in Utrecht, the Netherlands, the daughter of Theo Mentel, a contractor, and Maude Meijlink. .She is survived by her mother; her husband; a son from a previous relationship, Julian van de Kamp; two stepdaughters, Laila and Annabella Spee; and a half sister, Jody Mentel. .Ms. Mentel studied law for a year before becoming a professional snowboarder. She received a degree in sports management from the Randstad Topsport Academy in 2004 and a master’s in sports management from the Johan Cruyff Institute in 2014. She retired from snowboarding in 2018 to focus on her nonprofit, which helps children with disabilities compete in sports. .During surgery after yet another recurrence of cancer in 2018, Ms. Mentel lost feeling in her lower body. She began using a wheelchair — and  . in the Dutch version of “Dancing With the Stars.” .“As an athlete, it’s a funny thing — people look up to you, put you on a pedestal, think you’re capable of doing anything,” she said during  ., just before her surgery. “A week later, suddenly you’re disabled, and now people were telling me what I could not do. And this made me really rebellious. Because, let’s be honest: The more people were telling me what I could not do, the more I wanted to prove them wrong.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/bibian-mentel-dead.html
"In Tennis, Tough Decisions as Players Adjust to Shrunken Paydays","Lloyd Harris has been on a bit of a roll this year. .It’s a good thing, too, because if the 24-year-old from South Africa weren’t, he might be having a hard time breaking even as a professional tennis player these days. Even with his recent success — which includes making the third round of the Australian Open in February, the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships last month, and the second round at the Miami Open last week — his earnings are hardly the windfall they might have been, because prize money in his sport has been substantially downsized during the coronavirus pandemic and expenses are higher than ever. .Harris,  ., probably will not be able to go home until November. So he has to support himself on the road and pay for his usual coaching and physiotherapy, expenses that can run into the high six figures for a player of his caliber. .“It was definitely tough last year,” Harris said last week after a tight first-round win over Emilio Nava. “This year, with the prize money being so reduced, it can really be a struggle.” .Professional tennis may be the most economically top-heavy sport in the world. The best players are fabulously wealthy, in part because of lavish endorsement deals, and any player ranked in the top 30 lives very well. .For those ranked between roughly 40th and 70th, a bad few months can cause serious problems. Life for those outside the top 80, and especially outside the top 100, can be precarious. .The pandemic has made things more challenging, as cuts in prize money at most tournaments make each win more essential for players fighting for the extra cash that comes with making each successive round. .At the Miami Open, which concludes this weekend, more than 200 players have been vying for $6.7 million. That is among the largest prize purses outside the Grand Slam events and the tour finals, but it is down nearly 60 percent from 2019, when the purse was $16.7 million. .Heading into the season, the men’s and women’s tours worked with the players and tournament executives to figure out how to share revenues in an environment where only a fraction of the usual number of tickets can be sold. .The professional tours have tried to structure prize payments so that players eliminated in the early rounds can still make a decent wage. .In Miami, making the second round yielded $16,000 for a player this year compared with nearly $30,000 in 2019, the previous time the tournament took place. The winners will receive just over $300,000, a healthy payday but down nearly 80 percent from 2019. The tours are helping smaller tournaments avoid deficits by funding prize purses through broadcast rights deals and cash reserves. .“It’s obviously a very challenging period of time for everybody,” said Steve Simon, chief executive of the women’s professional tour, the W.T.A. “Our approach was how do we manage this so we have prize money levels in a manner that would support players and make sure our events can operate.” .No one needs to take up a collection for players who advance deep into tournaments, but the economics of being a solid professional tennis player can be challenging. .Depending on the country where a player lives, roughly 50 percent of income can go to taxes. A decent coach demands $50,000 to $100,000 a year plus travel costs. Fitness training and physiotherapy over an 11-month season can cost an additional tens of thousands of dollars. .Danielle Collins, the 27-year-old American  ., trained with a four-person team before the pandemic — a tennis coach, a hitting partner, a physiotherapist and a fitness coach. With the cuts in prize money, though, Collins is now training largely with her boyfriend, Tom Couch, who is her fitness coach. .“We don’t have an organization that pays for coaches, and physios and nutritionists like we would if we were on a team,” she said. “We have financial responsibilities that we are 100 percent committed to. Having to manage through that with the pandemic and ongoing uncertainty and with the prize money reductions, it’s taken a toll.” .Also, travel this year figures to be more expensive, given the restrictions and quarantine rules that can change from week to week and country to country. .This month the professional tours will shift to the clay- and grass-court seasons in Europe until mid-July. In typical years, players might return home several times during that period, especially if they lose early in one tournament and have a two-week lag until the start of the next event on their schedules. That might prove difficult this year. .“If you can get to Europe, you might just want to stay there,” said  ., a 20-year-old American who recently broke into the top 100. .Housing abroad is complicated. When players are eliminated from a tournament, they lose their free lodging until the next tournament starts. .And the pandemic presents more than logistical challenges. .“We’re always at risk of contracting the virus and being in a  .” said John Isner, a veteran player from the United States. “To do that in an environment where the money is much less is very risky on our part.” .There is little choice but to keep competing. Endorsement contracts are often laden with incentives that require players to enter a minimum number of tournaments and earn rankings points by advancing. Collins said these deals — New Balance and Babolat are her main sponsors — had helped sustain many players during the past year. .“For players outside of top 100, they might have opportunities to play, but they are losing money by playing,” she said. .Harris had to default his second-round match in Miami. In the coming weeks, he plans to use Dubai as a kind of base camp, because if he returned to his home in South Africa, where the virus has been prevalent, he couldn’t be sure which countries would permit him to enter later. .He has won nearly $300,000 in prize money this year, bringing his career total to $1.5 million. That may sound like a lot, but Harris turned professional in 2016. He spent far more than he earned during his first four seasons. He was fortunate that his two sponsors, Lotto and Yonex, remained loyal as he grinded through the lower-tier tournaments. .Now, after a busy winter, he is trying to set aside his desire for a break, particularly from the restrictions players must follow while competing. .“Most of the guys on tour have been very selective about where they can play,” Harris said. .But he is finally winning more than losing at the top level. He is climbing the rankings and making decent money. For better or for worse, after a short break, he plans to play on.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/tennis/tennis-atp-wta-money.html
"With New Wrinkle, N.H.L. Division Races Heat Up","There’s a lot that is different about the N.H.L. schedule this season. .Start with the compressed timeline, requiring 868 regular-season games to be played in 119 days. Then there are the numerous Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, with more added since the season started. And due to the postponements and shutdowns, schedules have been in near-constant flux, wreaking havoc on practices and planning. .Yet there’s widespread agreement that this season’s scheduling format, which mostly features two-game series in the same city with a day off in between, and the geography-driven divisional alignment, has enlivened what typically is a grueling slog to the Stanley Cup playoffs. .“If you could put fans in the building,” Winnipeg Coach Paul Maurice said, “I would love for it to be like this forever.” .As teams approach the final 20 games of the regular season, and races to gain playoff position by finishing in the top four of each division intensify, this year’s schedule provides another bonus. The exclusively intradivisional play makes each contest a four-point game and provides the potential for quick climbs or slides in the standings. .In its 10 games starting March 11, Nashville went 7-3, including a five-game winning streak, to move from sixth place in the Central Division into a tie for fourth. After beating the Rangers on March 4, Philadelphia was tied for second place in the East Division with 27 points. Going into its game Wednesday, the Flyers had fallen to fifth, three points out of a playoff spot. .“You can’t afford to lose two or three in a row, and everyone knows that,” Winnipeg forward Pierre-Luc DuBois said. .DuBois added: “It’s just part of the fun challenge this year.” .With such volatility in the standings, the challenge for general managers, especially as the April 12 trade deadline approaches, is determining which clubs are buyers and which are sellers. .“I think teams are a little more reluctant to shake the tree, as it were, than they normally are,” Minnesota General Manager Bill Guerin said in a video news conference Wednesday. “Speaking for us, we’re keeping team chemistry in mind because we have good team chemistry and the guys are playing well together. So do you upset that? It’s still pretty quiet out there.” .The games themselves have more energy and intensity, Maurice said, partly because of the reduced travel. .Last season, Boston was in a division with Florida and Tampa Bay. This year, the Bruins’ most distant opponents are Pittsburgh and Buffalo, and travel between the others — Washington, Philadelphia, the Devils, the Rangers and the Islanders, has been done by train or bus. .This season, Vancouver has to make three trips instead of one, to play games in Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa. But in all three cases it is scheduled to play two multi-game series and return home, rather than remain on the road as part of a longer trip, dramatically lessening travel demands. .“There’s times in the normal schedule where a team’s coming in, they’ve played the night before, and they get in at four in the morning, so that’s a big advantage to us,” Detroit Coach Jeff Blashill said. “Now, for the most part, we’re all in the same boat, so travel becomes less of a factor.” .Players also like the ability to focus on an opponent for more than one night. Teams have had to make more adjustments, Flyers forward Travis Konecny said. .“It’s about adapting and surprising the other team with different stuff every night, and they’re doing the same thing to us, so it’s fun,” he said. .Geography has created new rivalries and intensified others. The teams in the United States now play each other eight times, while the seven Canadian teams play four teams nine times and two teams 10 times. .Carolina, which was in the Metropolitan Division last season, is in the same division as Florida and Tampa Bay this year, and all three teams are bunched at the top of the Central. .“There are some guys you’re not going to like more than others on back-to-back nights,” Carolina forward Brett Pesce said. .Before this season, the last time N.H.L. teams played each other three straight times was in 2012-13. Already there have been a few four-game series — a league first. And from Feb. 2 to 15, the Coyotes and Blues played seven straight times because of Covid-related postponements that required schedule shuffling. The teams split the first six games, and Arizona’s Clayton Keller scored the only goal in the seventh. .“It was a fun series,” Keller said. “Almost every game was tight, and it had a playofflike atmosphere.” .Carolina played four straight games against Tampa Bay in February and finished a four-game set with Columbus on March 25, losing the first two games at home and winning the last two on the road. .For Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook, no series against a single opponent is too long. .“Looking back to October and November, when we were thinking we might not even be playing a season, I don’t care if we play one team 56 times,” he said. “As long as you’re playing N.H.L. games, you can’t take it for granted. I’m just happy we’re playing.” .During a news conference on March 11, N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would return to its former divisional alignment next season. He did, however, leave open the option to tweak the schedule to allow for more intradivisional play as well as back-to-back games, which would please Blashill. .“I think it’s very, very difficult to beat the same team twice in a row,” said Blashill, a former college and American Hockey League coach. “I saw that going back to my college hockey background, and we had that in the A.H.L. as well. It makes for very competitive games night in and night out.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/hockey/nhl-division-races-trade-deadline.html

Justice Dept. Inquiry Into Matt Gaetz Said to Be Focused on Cash Paid to Women,"WASHINGTON — A Justice Department investigation into Representative Matt Gaetz and an indicted Florida politician is focusing on their involvement with multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments, according to people close to the investigation and text messages and payment receipts reviewed by The New York Times. .Investigators believe Joel Greenberg, the former tax collector in Seminole County, Fla., who was indicted last year on a federal sex trafficking charge and other crimes, initially met the women through websites that connect people who go on dates in exchange for gifts, fine dining, travel and allowances, according to three people with knowledge of the encounters. Mr. Greenberg introduced the women to Mr. Gaetz, who also had sex with them, the people said. .One of the women who had sex with both men also agreed to have sex with an unidentified associate of theirs in Florida Republican politics, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Greenberg had initially contacted her online and introduced her to Mr. Gaetz, the person said. .Mr. Gaetz denied ever paying a woman for sex. .The Justice Department inquiry  . whether Mr. Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl and whether she received anything of material value, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The sex trafficking count against Mr. Greenberg involved the same girl, according to two people briefed on the investigation. .The authorities have also investigated whether other men connected to Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg had sex with the 17-year-old, two of the people said. .Mr. Gaetz, 38, was elected to Congress in 2016 and became one of President Donald J. Trump’s most outspoken advocates. .The Times has reviewed receipts from Cash App, a mobile payments app, and Apple Pay that show payments from Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg to one of the women, and a payment from Mr. Greenberg to a second woman. The women told their friends that the payments were for sex with the two men, according to two people familiar with the conversations. .In encounters during 2019 and 2020, Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg instructed the women to meet at certain times and places, often at hotels around Florida, and would tell them the amount of money they were willing to pay, according to the messages and interviews. .One person said that the men also paid in cash, sometimes withdrawn from a hotel ATM. .Some of the men and women took ecstasy, an illegal mood-altering drug, before having sex, including Mr. Gaetz, two people familiar with the encounters said. .In some cases, Mr. Gaetz asked women to help find others who might be interested in having sex with him and his friends, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Should anyone inquire about their relationships, one person said, Mr. Gaetz told the women to say that he had paid for hotel rooms and dinners as part of their dates. .The F.B.I. has questioned multiple women involved in the encounters, including as recently as January, to establish details of their relationships with Mr. Gaetz and his friends, according to text messages and two people familiar with the interviews. .No charges have been brought against Mr. Gaetz, and the extent of his criminal exposure is unclear. Mr. Gaetz’s office issued a statement on Thursday night in a response to a request for comment. .“Matt Gaetz has never paid for sex,” the statement said. “Matt Gaetz refutes all the disgusting allegations completely. Matt Gaetz has never ever been on any such websites whatsoever. Matt Gaetz cherishes the relationships in his past and looks forward to marrying the love of his life.” .A lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, Fritz Scheller, declined to comment, as did a Justice Department spokesman. .It is not illegal to provide adults with free hotel stays, meals and other gifts, but if prosecutors think they can prove that the payments to the women were for sex, they could accuse Mr. Gaetz of trafficking the women under “force, fraud or coercion.” For example, prosecutors have filed trafficking charges against people suspected of providing drugs in exchange for sex because feeding another person’s drug habit could be seen as a form of coercion. .It is also a violation of federal child sex trafficking law to provide someone under 18 with anything of value in exchange for sex, which can include meals, hotels, drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. A conviction carries a 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence. .The investigation stems from the Justice Department’s continuing inquiry into Mr. Greenberg, who potentially faces decades in prison on three dozen charges. The U.S. attorney’s office in Central Florida initially secured an indictment against Mr. Greenberg in June, alleging that he had stalked a political rival and had used his elected office to create fake identification cards. .During the investigation, the authorities discovered evidence that prompted them to broaden it, and Mr. Greenberg  . in August on the sex trafficking charge. .One of the sites the men met women through was called Seeking Arrangement, which  . as a place where wealthy people find attractive companions and pamper them “with fine dinners, exotic trips and allowances.” The site’s founder has said it has  .. The F.B.I. mentioned the website in a conversation with at least one potential witness, according to a person familiar with the conversation. .Mr. Greenberg was indicted this week  ., accusing him of submitting false claims to receive pandemic relief aid from the government and trying to bribe a government official. The authorities said Mr. Greenberg undertook those efforts after he was initially indicted last summer. .Mr. Greenberg, who has pleaded not guilty to the earlier charges, is scheduled to go on trial in June. He was sent to jail in March for violating the terms of his bail. .Mr. Gaetz said this week that his lawyers had been in touch with the Justice Department and that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. Subjects of investigations are often witnesses or people who might have information that could help the government pursue its targets. But it is common for that designation to shift over the course of an investigation. .“I only know that it has to do with women,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.” .Mr. Gaetz, a lawyer, was first elected to the House representing the Florida Panhandle at age 34. The son of a former president of the Florida State Senate, Mr. Gaetz attended Florida State University and William & Mary Law School before serving in the Florida State Legislature. .Mr. Gaetz has sought to divert attention from the Justice Department investigation by claiming that he and his father were the targets of an extortion plot by two men trying to secure funding for a separate venture. .The men — Robert Kent, a former Air Force intelligence officer who runs a consulting business, and Stephen Alford, a real estate developer who has been convicted of fraud — approached Mr. Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, about funding their efforts to locate Robert A. Levinson, an American hostage held in Iran. They suggested to Don Gaetz that Mr. Levinson’s successful return could somehow be used to secure a pardon for Matt Gaetz if he were charged with federal crimes, according to a copy of their proposal provided to The Times. .Soon after, Don Gaetz hired a lawyer and contacted the F.B.I. Matt Gaetz said his father wore a wire and taped a meeting and a telephone conversation with Mr. Alford. An email exchange between Don Gaetz’s lawyer and the Justice Department provided to The Times appears to confirm he was generally cooperating with the F.B.I. as it looked into his claims. .Mr. Kent denied the Gaetzes’ assertions. He said he had heard rumors that Matt Gaetz might be under investigation and mentioned them only to sweeten his proposal. “I told him I’m not trying to extort, but if this were true, he might be interested in doing something good,” Mr. Kent said in an interview. .Last year, the Trump administration  ., a former F.B.I. agent, that he had died while in captivity in Iran, where he disappeared in 2007 while on an unauthorized mission for the C.I.A. .But some people involved with the Levinson case continued to believe that he might still be alive, including Mr. Kent. .He was stunned when he heard that Matt Gaetz had sought to tie the Justice Department investigation to an extortion plot related to the Levinson case. .“He threw Levinson and the entire Levinson family under the bus,” Mr. Kent said. “I can’t imagine what these poor people have been through.

,"As his Yankees teammates watched Giancarlo Stanton rocket ball after ball out of the batter’s box, day after day during spring training, it often felt like October again. Stanton was happy and healthy then, crushing home run after home run while  . of the American League Championship Series. .“My gosh, I mean the home runs he was hitting weren’t just home runs but light-tower home runs,” Yankees first baseman Luke Voit said, adding: “The only problem is that I hit behind him and when he hits those balls so far, I’m like, ‘All right, I’ve got to do the same thing.’ And I ended up striking out.” .Stanton has not always looked or felt that good since the Miami Marlins offloaded him and his huge contract onto the Yankees after his award-winning 2017 season. Because of  ., Stanton, one of the fittest and strongest players in baseball, has appeared in roughly half of his team’s games since his move to New York. And when he was in the lineup during past postseasons, he  ., either. .That changed last season, as did his leadership role within the team on important social issues. And now, fresh off that big October, he is looking for an even bigger year. .“He looks great,” Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said after watching Stanton one day this spring. “He looks like he hasn’t really skipped a beat from what I remember him being last October.” .The Yankees — a favorite to contend for the World Series title, a crown that has eluded them since 2009 — have many stars. There is pitcher  ., the ace who will start opening day on Thursday against the Toronto Blue Jays. There is  ., the Yankees’ best all-around player and the  . last season. And there are outfielder Aaron Judge, closer Aroldis Chapman, shortstop Gleyber Torres and others. .“Our success is tied to some of our big boys really thriving,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said recently. .There are few bigger boys in baseball than Stanton, 31, a designated hitter listed at 6-foot-6 and 245 pounds, and the only current Yankees player with a Most Valuable Player Award on his résumé. In the past, Stanton’s size has sometimes worked against him. Since hitting 38 home runs and driving in 100 runs in 158 games of his first regular season with the Yankees, in 2018, Stanton has played in only 41 regular-season games. His list of physical ailments since is long: a biceps strain, a balky shoulder,  ., a sprained knee, a strained quadriceps and a pulled hamstring. .“It hasn’t been fun,” Stanton said recently. He knows people inside baseball and out question his durability, just as he knows the only way to dump that label is to play. “You got to be out there on the field,” he said, “if you don’t want questions.” .So after an injury-marred 2019 season, Stanton said he had lost roughly 20 pounds — an attempt to return to the weight of his healthier, most productive years. But that didn’t do the trick: Stanton was limited, again, appearing in only 23 of the Yankees’ 60 games in the truncated 2020 regular season. . He significantly altered his workout regimen this winter and lifted weights less often, the Yankees’ director of player health and performance, Eric Cressey, told  .. The result, Stanton said, has been improved agility and, he hopes, better odds of staying on the field. .Stanton’s father, Mike, said that the injuries had been the low points of his son’s career, which has included four All-Star selections and 312 career home runs. “He wants nothing more than to be out there contributing,” Mike Stanton said in a phone interview this week. .Even while on the injured list last year, Stanton contributed in valuable ways. As  . that was consuming the nation reached into Major League Baseball clubhouses, Stanton, one of the quieter players on the Yankees, stood front and center during several team meetings on the subject, teammates and team officials said. .He shared stories about his experience as a biracial man in America, spoke about growing up in Los Angeles mere blocks from where Rodney King was beaten by the police in 1991, and made clear his thoughts about what needed to change. In a sport with relatively few Black American players, Stanton was also one of the few people who regularly knelt during the national anthem. .“It was cool that he was speaking out, because there are people in that room that have never experienced anything like others have,” said Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier, who is white. .“And when he was speaking out and he was talking about things that he had experienced, and others were talking about it, it really pulls at your heartstrings. And it made you realize the way that these guys compartmentalize some of the things that happened in their everyday life versus what’s happening at the field.” .Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a phone interview that Stanton’s physical strength had always been apparent. But as protests and difficult discussions about race swept the country, Cashman added, Stanton “rose to the occasion, and that inner strength showed up from Day 1.” .“It needed to be done,” Stanton said. .Stanton, whose  . were African-American and Puerto Rican, said what he saw in the country last year reminded him of what his grandmother and mother used to tell him that they experienced. While speaking up, Stanton said, he simply wanted the people around him to learn more about the issues. .He said he cared little if his words and actions led others to label him a team leader or not, and this winter he made clear he planned to stay a Yankee by passing up the opportunity to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract, which has seven years and a guaranteed $218 million remaining. .Given his injury history, it would be tough for Stanton to top that guaranteed money as a free agent, and he has emphasized that he wants to win a World Series with the Yankees. Stanton now hopes that, at least for the next eight months, his body will cooperate. .Boone has predicted “a huge season” for Stanton if the Yankees can help him stay on the field. A reason for his bullishness: Boone argued that Stanton was a better hitter now than he was in his M.V.P. season, in 2017, when he smashed 59 home runs and drove in 132 runs. .Stanton concurred, citing his improved approach at the plate (his walk rate was up the past two seasons). He said he had done eye training over the years. Last October, he tied a Yankees record with six home runs in a single postseason. .“When he’s healthy, he is one of the best players in the game,” Cashman said. “That has never been in dispute. And if anybody had questions to whether he could be the same type of player when healthy in the postseason, he showed that as well last year.” .The key for Stanton will be showing it during a marathon baseball season. There are hints that will be possible. During a recent batting practice in Florida, Stanton and Judge were back to clobbering balls over the fence. As he left the cage, Frazier sidled up to Stanton and asked, “Don’t you feel like you should be on a field that’s bigger than the one that you’re on right now?” .Stanton agreed. The Yankees will be happy simply to have him on the field.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/baseball/yankees-giancarlo-stanton-opening-day.html
Women’s Basketball Coaches Challenge N.C.A.A. Leaders Over Gender Inequity,"Top coaches in women’s college basketball pressed N.C.A.A. executives directly on Wednesday over what they have judged as chronic failures to promote and support the sport — longstanding tensions that have now ignited a public furor over  .. .“We’re going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we don’t really step up to the plate at the N.C.A.A. as a whole to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,” Nell Fortner of Georgia Tech told N.C.A.A. President Mark Emmert as coaches who have spent years leading teams through deep postseason runs watched. .The roughly 70-minute videoconference, which the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association organized and The New York Times viewed, came as the N.C.A.A. has struggled to move past criticism of its management of women’s basketball, which has grown into a greater force in college athletics. The unequal facilities at this year’s men’s and women’s competitions, coaches and executives alike have acknowledged, are only symptoms of deeper concerns about gender equity and whether the N.C.A.A. has unfairly prioritized the hugely profitable men’s tournament over the money-losing women’s competition. .Emmert told the coaches that the association recognized it had “some serious work to do” around women’s basketball and that “there’s no question that we dropped the ball, that we had some serious misses” around the 2021 women’s tournament, which will culminate Sunday night with the championship game in San Antonio. .“We’ve got to make sure that when we have our championships around our two marquee sports — the sports that more people watch than anything else — that we put on display the kind of equity that we all aspire to, and we sure as heck didn’t do that this year,” Emmert said. .College sports officials have said that the coronavirus pandemic posed  . for this year’s tournaments. But some of women’s basketball’s leading figures used Wednesday’s meeting to argue bluntly to top officials that the very structure of the N.C.A.A. — like its organization chart and  . — had contributed to long-term inequities. .The vice president of women’s basketball, for example, is not a member of Emmert’s senior management team; the association’s vice president of basketball, whose attention is largely directed toward the men’s tournament, is. .Dan Gavitt, the vice president of basketball, also acknowledged Wednesday that a dozen employees are dedicated to the men’s tournament, on which the N.C.A.A. is financially dependent, while six are focused on the women’s competition. .“As leaders, I think we have to bear the responsibility for anything that goes wrong in our organization,” Muffet McGraw, who won two national titles at Notre Dame before her retirement last year, told Emmert. “In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio — this is way deeper than that.” .Other coaches soon ticked through their own worries. .Geno Auriemma, Connecticut’s coach, warned that the university chancellors and presidents who have enormous influence over the N.C.A.A. and will play crucial roles in approving meaningful reforms “bring their biases from their own campuses.” .Dawn Staley of South Carolina challenged Emmert’s decision to  . instead of appointing a group that might be more independent. .U.C.L.A.’s Cori Close questioned why the association distributes money to conferences based on performances in the men’s tournament but not the women’s, and Fortner wondered why the N.C.A.A. had not made more use of its financial and marketing might to support the women’s game. .Fortner noted, for instance, that the men’s tournament had courts that amounted to “eye candy” for casual television viewers, potentially drawing them in as they toggled through channels, while many of the women’s games were played on floors that did little to suggest the gravity of the competition. .“If you were flipping through the TV to find the women’s tournament, you would not have stayed on the game,” she said, “because you might have thought it was a high school game.” .But during his exchanges with Fortner on Wednesday, Emmert suggested that N.C.A.A. officials were contemplating expanding the use of its March Madness brand, which is synonymous with men’s basketball, to include the women’s tournament. .“Why isn’t March Madness just plastered everywhere at the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament?” Fortner asked. “It’s not on our floors. It’s not anywhere, and I wonder why. Why not?” .“I think it should be,” Emmert replied. “I want to get to the answer to that question because the truth is, I don’t know.” .Gavitt acknowledged that ESPN, which broadcasts the women’s tournament, would have a voice in the deliberations about how to promote the tournament: “If ESPN is not going to embrace using March Madness in everything they do, is it enhancing the championship to the level that we all think it can? If they will, then I think it’s a great opportunity.” .ESPN declined to comment on Wednesday, but it would likely use whatever branding that the N.C.A.A. chose. .Emmert and the other executives offered little in the way of detailed guarantees to the coaches. Instead, they largely acknowledged concerns, pledged unspecified reforms and insisted that the N.C.A.A. had not deliberately diminished women’s basketball. .“I do believe and have believed all along that women’s basketball and women’s sports is and can be a very powerful social and economic driver,” said Lynn Holzman, a former Kansas State player who is now the vice president of women’s basketball and reports to Gavitt. “Just look at the attention it’s garnered over the last week or so.” .Indeed, the N.C.A.A. has seen its tournaments sometimes overshadowed by the management turmoil around the women’s competition. Wednesday’s apologies were only the latest expressions of regret, especially concerning workout facilities that were flimsily stocked for the women’s tournament in Texas and well-supplied for the men’s event in Indiana. .N.C.A.A. officials had hoped that the outrage surrounding the tournaments would ebb, especially as the competitions advanced to their later rounds. But that seemed to reflect a misjudgment of the frustrations coursing through women’s basketball and, for that matter, the wider college sports industry. .Less than 24 hours before the meeting with Emmert, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the group that convened Wednesday’s call, released a video that challenged the association’s plan to investigate what had happened, much as Staley did on Wednesday. .“We will remain diligent in ensuring that the voice of our member coaches are heard and the best interests of our sport are protected as this much-needed review, whatever form it may ultimately take, begins,” Donehew said. .If the law firm’s review proceeds according to the N.C.A.A.’s timetable, a report is supposed to be made public this summer.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-inequity.html
‘Can’t Wait to Be Able to Hold Them’: Players’ Parents in an N.C.A.A. Bubble,"SAN ANTONIO — Michelle Bain-Brink took books and a container of macaroons to her daughter, Cameron, a freshman forward for Stanford, the morning after the team rallied against Louisville on Tuesday to advance to the  .. Bain-Brink fully expected to leave the packages with a security guard who would send them to her daughter’s room in the team hotel. .Coincidentally, Cameron Brink was in the lobby at the same time, delivering a bag for the security guard to give to her mother. .From 20 feet away, through the glass doors of the Marriott Rivercenter hotel in downtown San Antonio, the mother and daughter yelled “hello” and “love you” to one another. .It was their first face-to-face conversation in person over the past three months. .“I got quite emotional, because although I’ve seen her from the stands, seeing her like that, unexpectedly, was really touching,” Bain-Brink, who lives in Oregon, said in an interview on Wednesday. .Bain-Brink and her husband, Greg Brink, are happy just to be here in San Antonio, able to attend their daughter’s games again even though they are not allowed direct contact. Stanford, seeking its first national title since 1992, will meet South Carolina in a semifinal on Friday. .Stanford was especially prepared for the bubblelike environment that players and staff members are enduring at the three-week-long national tournament centered in San Antonio. While the coronavirus pandemic led to restricted attendance at most college competitions, the Stanford team played the bulk of its season as a group of nomads, in strange arenas without fans or family in the stands. .Until the Pac-12 tournament, which Stanford won last month, Cameron Brink’s parents had not watched in person as she competed for the Cardinal, and a year had passed since they last watched one of her games from the stands. .The Cardinal had to spend nine consecutive weeks away from their Northern California campus, because the surrounding Santa Clara County had established coronavirus safety protocols that prohibited contact sports. .Instead the team lived in hotels, periodically practiced in Las Vegas and played “home games” in Santa Cruz, about 45 miles from the Stanford campus. .For parents who had been in the stands for almost every game since their child could hold a basketball, the experience was disorienting. .“You forget what it is like to make eye contact with her as she’s coming off the court going into the locker room,” Bain-Brink said. .When Kiana Williams, a senior on the Stanford team, told her father, Mike Williams, that spectators were going to be allowed at the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas, he “unglued” himself from his chair, he said, and called three relatives. He and his wife left the family home in San Antonio to see their daughter in person for the first time since he dropped her off at Stanford in September, with tears in his eyes. .The conference tournament arrangement felt like winning the lottery, Mike Williams said in an interview on Wednesday. Then he learned about the N.C.A.A.’s  . for this year’s national tournament. .The whole event, rather than just the Final Four, would be held in San Antonio. .“So now we’re on cloud nine, because now we didn’t have to travel and we knew she was going to be here for three weeks,” Williams said. “So we’re just full of joy, just happy. I told the parents in Vegas, since the tournament is going to be in San Antonio, let’s have a big powwow and I’ll barbecue for you.” .He did — the Saturday before  .. Such gatherings have enhanced a bond that the parents developed through video calls and WhatsApp messages this season while watching their children from afar. .“It almost made us closer, when we couldn’t even be around each other, which seems backwards, but it’s something that’s very true,” Jaime Hull, the mother of the twins Lexie and Lacie Hull, said in an interview on Wednesday. “You start having that camaraderie together. Like on game days, parents text back and forth that we’re all sitting in our homes, watching the games and rooting everybody on.” .When they are not watching games from the arena stands, the parents are having their own fun in San Antonio. .The Brinks have been dipping into restaurants recommended by the television show “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,” and the Hulls have been playing a number of card games. .In a hotel about a block away, the Stanford players have found their own diversions — including a Ping-Pong tournament, the champion of which will be crowned on Saturday, Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said on Thursday. .“Hannah has talked about my weaknesses, and I think she’s spot on,” Lexie Hull, one of the Ping-Pong finalists, told reporters on Thursday about having to face her teammate Hannah Jump. “So I expect her to exploit those to the fullest. I want to be very confident going into that game, but I really think she might have a better skill-set, so I’m going to have to come out grittier and just really locked in.” .The parents have said that they can see a benefit of their children having been isolated together. On campus during the pandemic, players lived in apartments near the athletic facilities, limiting whom they would run into in hallways. Stanford was mostly barren, while the few students permitted to be there attended online classes from their residential bubbles. .Leaving campus made the team tighter, Jaime Hull said. .“I see a lot of individuals on teams, and I don’t see a lot of individuals on Stanford,” Jaime Hull said. “They play as a team, they play as a unit. One might be down and someone else might step up, and they are right there having each other’s back.” .Same goes for the parents and the cheering squad. From that 300-person block of friends and family dressed in Cardinal attire — including Russell Wilson, a fairly accomplished football player who is better known in this crowd as the boisterous older brother of guard Anna Wilson — screams of “defense,” “Go Card” and “Ki” accompany the action. .Kiana Williams’s cheering section is upward of 60 people: family, friends and basketball players on the youth team that her father coaches. .The families take their job very seriously. When Stanford was  . in the round of 8, the parents regrouped. .“I felt like I played in the game at the end of that,” Jaime Hull said. “I was so sweaty, and I think my heel is bruised from pounding the bleacher with my foot.” .Of course, playing near a teammate’s home has other perks. On Wednesday evening, Kiana Williams’s brother’s wife’s grandmother wrapped up two pans of homemade lasagna — one with meat and one without — and gave them to Williams’s mother, LaChelle, who drove them to the team’s hotel. She left the lasagna, cooked with love for the players and staff, with some of the credentialed personnel. .“And it was delicious,” VanDerveer said. .While the parents are excited to see their children to play, they are more thrilled about the prospect of having them come home. .“As soon as the game is over and she gets on the bus and goes to the hotel, we’ll be right behind the bus,” Mike Williams said. .“We have these big chair couches,” Greg Brink said of the family home in Oregon, “so a lot of people can climb on them at one time — a lot of cuddling, the dog is going to be jumping on top of this.” .“Win or lose, I don’t care, I just can’t wait to be able to hold them. But they’re going to fight until the end,” Jaime Hull said, acknowledging that the title game on Sunday could delay the reunions. “So I’ll wait until Monday, if that’s what it takes, or Sunday night. I can make it that long.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-tournament-stanford.html
,"In late July, as the 2020  . season started amid the pandemic, Colorado Rockies outfielder Ian Desmond found himself standing on his eight-acre property in Sarasota, Fla. .Palmetto bushes had overtaken much of the land. Desmond, who had opted out of the season, was home in the summer for the first time in 12 years. He decided to take on the stubborn fronds. .When he wasn’t working in the yard, he helped his children learn to ride his neighbor’s horses. Desmond’s middle son, Cruz, loved riding so much that he opted out of spring baseball so he could learn to rodeo instead. .“Ian is a person who is always outside, always doing something,” Chelsey Desmond said of her husband. “He doesn’t do well with idle time.” .From August to November, Desmond, 35, helped coach his sons’ youth baseball team (his three sons: Grayson, Cruz and Ashton — 9, 8 and 6 — were on the same squad), which won its first championship. On Sept. 15, the Desmonds welcomed their fifth child, and second daughter, Naomi, into the world. Their daughter Dakota was born in 2019. .Desmond, who hit 20 home runs in 2019 and was an All-Star in 2012 and 2016, took control of his story. In detailing last June why he would not be playing the 2020 season, giving up a prorated salary of $5.5 million, he  . It focused on his experience of growing up biracial and spoke of how the police killing of George Floyd had stirred memories of his own brushes with systemic racism; it also explained his desire to be with his children as they navigated national conversations about racial justice. .His post also included a call to action for himself, which he answered in December, when  ., a charity he helped found that uses baseball as a tool for holistic development for underserved youth in Sarasota. Then, in February, he said he was opting out of the 2021 season “for now” as well. He stands to lose as much as $8 million this time, if he sits out the entire season. .Desmond grew up in Sarasota. His parents met in the Northeast, then moved to Florida before he was born. His mother, Pattie Paradise, is white, and his father, Wesley Desmond, was Black, which did not sit well with his mother’s family, Desmond said. .When he was 18 months, and his sister, Nikki, was 3, their father died unexpectedly. Paradise worked two jobs, sometimes three, to take care of them. She married Chris Charron, who is white, when Ian was 5. (The couple divorced 13 years later.) .The family lived in a mostly white neighborhood. When Nikki and Ian were in elementary school, their mother transferred them to a private, Catholic school, where they were among the few students of color. Ian said he learned later that the school held a meeting with the student body to announce that he and Nikki would be enrolling. “They had to prepare the kids and say, ‘Hey, there are some Black kids coming, biracial kids,’” Desmond said. .Their family didn’t talk a lot about race. Paradise and Charron had two more children. “Our sister is eight years younger than me, and people would ask her, ‘Why do your brother and sister have brown skin?’” Nikki said. .Ian played soccer, with mostly white teammates and opponents. Nikki participated in gymnastics, which was mostly white as well. “It’s fair to say that my sister and I identified as white,” Ian Desmond said. “We knew we were biracial, but we just kind of felt like one with the white community.” .Still, he encountered racial profiling. As a young teenager, he was heading to a Sports Authority when he saw a woman approaching the entrance. He hurried over to hold the door open for her. Instead of thanking him, she clutched her purse. .“I was like, ohhh,” Desmond said. “It was really nothing to me, but at the same time it was like, man, this lady thought I was going to rob her.” .He was never quite sure how to fill out “race” on a questionnaire. Was he white? Yes. Was he Black? Yes. .“The biggest part for me … it’s the identity,” Desmond said. “You think about the literal time where you have to fill out that box. It’s that feeling of being on an island and not knowing which way to paddle off — where are you? Where do you fit?” .Rather than vocalize those questions, he suppressed them. He channeled his energy and emotions into sports, which he approached with a quiet intensity. .Paradise, his mother, was a hairstylist, but she never cut her son’s hair into a fade, which one of his baseball coaches noticed. One afternoon, the coach, who is Black, went to Desmond’s house and gave him his first one. “I remember it was like, ‘Oh my gosh, my first fade!” Desmond said. “OK, now I know!” .When Desmond was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the third round in 2004 at age 18, he found himself most at ease with the Latino players. He still hung out with white and Black players, and became “amphibious,” he said, transforming to be like whichever group he was with. That skill helped him become a leader in clubhouses, with an ability to jump from circle to circle. .“That’s the life of someone who is biracial,” Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer, who is also biracial, said. “It helps you connect with people from different walks of life, not even just race. You’ve always been a little different in your own regard, and you’ve found a way to adapt. It might be a little tough when you’re young, but as you age you realize. That fully helped me.” .When the pandemic truncated spring training in 2020, the Desmonds flew home from Arizona and waited to see what would happen. Baseball writers had reached out to Desmond — one of the few Black American players on the Rockies’ roster — after the killings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. As the racial justice movements around the country grew, Desmond had more conversations and reflected on his experiences more candidly than before. .“That’s when he really started talking about situations that had happened to him that I didn’t know about,” Nikki said. .On May 22, Antwuan Roach, 18, was fatally shot in Washington. Desmond had met Roach through the Washington Nationals’ youth baseball academy, where he mentored and befriended him when he was 12. Roach had earned his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in a job training program. .“That really hit me hard,” Desmond said. “You wonder, ‘Were there other opportunities I may have missed out on to make an impact in his life?’” .Three days later, Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis. Again, reporters reached out. Desmond wanted to respond, but not by holding a news conference where journalists pulled out one or two quotes from a 45-minute session. .He called Amanda Comak Zrebiec, a former Nationals beat writer whom he had befriended, and asked her to help him articulate his thoughts. The two had several video conversations; as he talked, she took notes. The resulting post received over 43,000 likes and numerous comments of appreciation for his candor about being biracial. .Days later, Desmond was talking to a neighbor, Vince Northfield, who had retired from business at age 53. ‘How can I get something started?’ Desmond said. The two began meeting frequently, inside one of their barns, and texted and emailed with ideas when they weren’t together. Northfield paired his business and strategy acumen with Desmond’s vision. .Using the Nationals’ academy as a template, the two men established a partnership with the local Boys & Girls Club. They found facilities, supplies and volunteers and worked within pandemic parameters to plan safe, effective programming. .Newtown Connection, run through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Sarasota and DeSoto Counties, officially began operating this month. Standing on a field in the spring Florida sun, Desmond, Northfield and several volunteer coaches led close to 70 children in physical-education-style games like freeze tag and hula hoop. Using bean bags instead of baseballs, they introduced the game to children, many who had never played it. They described healthy eating habits, handed out snacks of bananas and apples, and talked about the word of the day: “respect.” .The twice-a-week programming will extend through the year (The Player’s Alliance donated bats, balls and gloves, for when the group graduates to using baseballs for drills), and Desmond’s ultimate goal is to create a template that other organizations can replicate around the country in connecting with and positively impacting youth, while also expanding diversity in exposure to baseball. .“You meet people who profess about family or philanthropy, but don’t actually follow through,” Northfield said. “Ian does it for real. It comes from the heart. You can see the way he helps and engages with people.” .Chelsey and Ian Desmond met in the fifth grade. They were a couple, as much as two children are at 11, and “dated” until high school, when they were just friends. (They reconnected as a couple when Ian was in the minors.) On a basketball court one afternoon, Chelsey, who is white, teased him about how cocky he was. She hadn’t been around anyone as confident and hard-working as Ian, she said, and she mistook that for cockiness. “When he sets his mind to do something, there is literally no stopping him,” she said. “He applies that to everything in his life, even if it’s just a tiny goal.” .Another of Desmond’s goals that emerged in 2020 was to encourage conversations about race and culture. He posted more frequently about racial justice on Instagram, whether it was defining racism and oppression or encouraging followers to “eat one meal this weekend in a restaurant on the opposite side of town.” .When Chelsey and Ian Desmond told their oldest son about Floyd’s killing, Grayson wondered if the same thing could happen to him. .“That was like a light bulb moment for us,” she said. “Of course, we want them to learn that it’s not what’s on the outside but what’s on the inside that counts. But avoiding it and not having the conversation is just as bad.” .Nikki and Ian Desmond grew up without any connection to their father’s side of the family, which included their great-aunt Viola Desmond, a Canadian civil rights activist whose image is on the Canadian $10 bill. In the past year, Desmond has reconnected with his father’s family, including his uncle Charles Desmond, chief executive of the largest children’s savings account initiative in Massachusetts and a civic and community organizer. .Learning about his family’s culture and background has helped Desmond shape his own conversations and narratives, as he encourages more thoughtful discussions of inclusivity in baseball and everyday lives. “If we are headed to a world of equality and acceptance and inclusiveness … will our world not be biracial?” Desmond said. .“We need more people like Ian to not only speak up, but to be brave enough to listen,” said Ryan Zimmerman, a former teammate of his whose work with a personal foundation was an inspiration to Desmond. “Ian would legitimately go out to dinner with that person who didn’t agree with him. He’s such a calm, sensible person who honestly wants to know what other people think.

"Virginia, the Old Confederacy’s Heart, Becomes a Voting Rights Bastion","ARLINGTON, Va. — Georgia  ., making drop boxes less available and forbidding anyone to hand out water to voters in line. Florida and Texas are poised to advance similar legislation. Alabama’s strict voter identification law is  . elsewhere. .As states across the South race to establish new voting restrictions, Virginia is bolting in the opposite direction. The Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, this week capped a multiyear liberal movement for greater ballot access by signing off on sweeping legislation to recreate pivotal elements of the federal Voting Rights Act that were  .. .Alone among the states of the former Confederacy, Virginia has become a voting rights bastion, increasingly encouraging its citizens — especially people of color — to exercise their democratic rights. In the last 14 months, the state’s Democratic-controlled General Assembly and Mr. Northam have together  ., enacted  ., made  . and enacted  . for anyone who receives a Virginia driver’s license. .Virginia, which for nearly 50 years had to submit changes to its elections to the federal government for approval under the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance requirements, has now effectively imposed the same covenants on itself, an extraordinary step for a state with a long history of segregation and racially targeted voting laws. .The new law that was approved on Wednesday, called the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, requires all local elections administrators to receive public feedback or advance approval from the state’s attorney general for changes like moving voting precincts or elections registrars’ offices, and allows voters and the attorney general to sue over voter suppression. It expressly prohibits any racial discrimination or intimidation related to voting. .“I have an aunt who marched against the poll tax. My grandparents both had to pay poll taxes,” said Marcia Price, a Democratic state delegate who sponsored the legislation. “Just knowing that they lived under a system that was unfair and unequal, I learned very early that it was wrong, and that it needs to be changed.” .Virginia’s expansion of voting protections comes at a moment when the state has ushered through  .. Since the 2019 election, when  . to give the party full control of state government for the first time since 1993, Virginia has  .;  .; introduced an  .; raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour; and allowed local governments to remove  ., which was once home to the capital of the Confederacy. .Republicans’ longtime grip on Virginia politics reached even the state’s most liberal corners. In Arlington, a Democratic stronghold across the Potomac River from Washington, a main highway stretching south from the nation’s capital was named for the Confederacy’s president, Jefferson Davis, for nearly a century until 2019. Under pressure from Mr. Northam,  .. .The state’s voting rights act is being signed into law by a governor whose career was  . in 2019. Since then, Mr. Northam has been at the forefront of a host of the state’s racial justice initiatives and  .. He said on Wednesday that the Virginia law should become a model for the nation. .“At a time when voting rights are under attack across our country, Virginia is expanding access to the ballot box, not restricting it,” Mr. Northam said. “Our Commonwealth is creating a model for how states can provide comprehensive voter protections that strengthen democracy and the integrity of our elections.” .Virginia’s turn away from its longtime restrictions on voting rights began in 2016, when Gov. Terry McAuliffe  . in the state over the objections of the Republican-led General Assembly and the state’s Supreme Court. After the court ruled that Mr. McAuliffe did not have the authority to restore felon voting rights en masse, but  ., he sent 206,000 individual voting rights restoration letters to felons, who were sent envelopes with a Virginia voter application form and a self-addressed stamped envelope. .“To me it was a moral, civil rights issue and this was a racist Jim Crow law that needed to be eliminated,” Mr. McAuliffe said on Wednesday. .Once Democrats took full control of state government last year, one of the first bills they passed created one of the longest early-voting periods in the country — a 45-day window for no-excuse absentee voting, in which people can vote remotely without having to provide a rationale.  . in the 2020 election, nearly five times as many as did so in 2016. .“This is what my ancestors fought hard for,” said Charniele Herring, the author of the early voting bill, who last year became the first Black majority leader in the Virginia House of Delegates. “My parents had to have that struggle in the ’60s, and this is the time to stop that struggle and to protect everybody’s right to vote, no matter their political affiliation.” .Republican state legislators all opposed the Virginia Voting Rights Act, arguing that it would inundate local election administrators with lawsuits and complicate routine changes to voting. Glenn Davis,  . who is running for lieutenant governor, said it was “simple human nature” that Democrats’ efforts to make voting easier, like eliminating Virginia’s photo identification requirement, would result in more fraud. .“When they said African-Americans are less likely to have IDs and be able to go to the D.M.V. to get an ID, to me that sounds offensive,” said Mr. Davis, who is white. “No one has ever come to me that was not a politician and said, ‘Glenn, I find it more difficult to get an ID.’” .The local preclearance requirement that Mr. Northam approved on Wednesday was sponsored by two Black women, State Senator Jennifer McClellan and Ms. Price. Both said they had drawn inspiration from their family history of experiencing voter suppression in Virginia. .“I had a great-grandfather in 1901 who had to take a literacy test and find three white people to vouch for him to be able to register,” said Ms. McClellan, a Democrat who is running for governor this year,  .. “In January, I found a copy of my dad’s receipt for the poll tax he had to pay.” .Ms. Price said the idea to recreate the preclearance statute at the state level was first discussed in 2017 by a group of Democratic legislators, all women of color. But even though Virginia was trending blue, the General Assembly was still controlled by Republicans, in part because of gerrymandered legislative district lines. Those districts were  ., paving the way for a Democratic majority in both legislative chambers. .While the central provision in the bill is intended to be protective, rather than to create new, expansive policies, Ms. Price and Ms. McClellan pointed to several recent episodes that the bill would have helped prevent. In September 2020, with little public announcement, the Richmond registrar’s office moved from City Hall to a location that wasn’t as accessible by bus, causing confusion during early voting. The year before, the Virginia Beach City Council moved an early voting location to a building that was at least a mile away from the nearest bus stop. .Ms. Price said that instances of voter suppression in November, and  . being produced by Republican-controlled statehouses across the country, added increased urgency to their effort .“Yes, it was reactive to Virginia’s history, but it was also proactive because of what we were seeing in other states,” Ms. Price said. “And we knew that we were not immune to it.” .In approving the bill, Mr. Northam added a few technical changes, so it will go back to the legislature later this month for final passage to become law. .While other states have created their own voting rights laws, Virginia’s stood out for specifically recreating some of the original federal protections. .“It’s building on what states like California and Illinois to a certain extent have done, but we really saw an opportunity to model what a full voting rights act can do,” said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, a co-director of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. .The bill creates a provision that closely mirrors Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows affected groups and voters to challenge changes to balloting in court if they will negatively affect minority communities or lead to voter suppression. .Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act is currently being challenged at the Supreme Court,  .. .Other provisions in the bill help expand access to voting in Virginia by requiring local election officials to provide voting materials in languages other than English if they meet certain thresholds; strengthening protections against discriminatory redistricting plans; and creating a Voter Education and Outreach Fund where all penalties stemming from voting lawsuits would be directed toward educating voters on their rights. .Yet while establishing the Virginia Voting Rights Act represents both a symbolic and landmark protection of voting rights, the state still has old laws on the books that voting rights groups say act as barriers to the ballot box. The Virginia Constitution still bars convicted felons from regaining their voting rights, though they can seek to have their rights restored through permission by the governor, as Mr. McAuliffe did in 2016. .“There are a lot of remnants from Jim Crow that still exist in Virginia,” said Tram Nguyen, a co-executive director at New Virginia Majority, a progressive group, who also worked on the bill. “Passing the Voting Rights Act of Virginia — being the first state in the South, the first state that was covered under Section 5 of preclearance to do it — signals to the country that here’s a state that has this dark history. And we are trying to get beyond that.” .Reid J.

The Title Race Is Over. The Fight for the Top Four Starts Now.,"Here, then, is the home straight of the Premier League season, the final quarter of a campaign that was heralded as the most chaotic, and least predictable, of them all. .At times, throughout autumn and into winter, the combination of empty stadiums, a packed schedule and a frantic pace seemed destined to usurp the established order. Contenders seemed to rise and fall every week. Earnest conversations were held about whether Aston Villa  . or if Arsenal was  .. .It did not, it turns out, quite come to pass. It soon became clear that Manchester City — the team with the best and biggest squad, the side with the brightest coach — would be champion while spring was still fresh in the air. Pep Guardiola’s team sits 14 points clear of Manchester United, its fingers already brushing a third crown in four years. .Relegation, too, is largely settled. Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion will be playing in the Championship next season; all that remains to be decided is whether Fulham can muster enough momentum to condemn Newcastle, drifting and directionless, to a place alongside them. .In that relative certainty, the Premier League is something of an outlier across Europe’s major leagues. Elsewhere, the curious circumstances of the pandemic season do seem to have had an effect. In Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid are slowly reeling in a stuttering Atlético Madrid. In Italy, Inter Milan has six points on its city rival, A.C. Milan, and 10 on Juventus and Atalanta. But with at least one fairly spectacular choke in fans’ relatively recent memory, that is not yet a gap broad enough to permit any comfort. .In Germany, the title race may effectively be decided this weekend, when Bayern Munich travels to RB Leipzig on Saturday knowing that victory will all but see off its last remaining challenger. A couple hours earlier, the top two teams in France will meet, though neither Lille nor Paris St.-Germain is in a position to deliver a decisive blow. Lyon and a resurgent Monaco are within touching distance of both, four teams separated by four points. .In the absence of questions at the top and bottom of the table, the Premier League has concentrated all of its drama, jeopardy and intrigue into the jostling for position immediately below Manchester City. There are three more spots available in the Champions League for next season and seven teams with a realistic shot at one of them. .Some are fallen giants, teams desperate to salvage something from a bitterly disappointing season. Others are surprise packages, those teams that have best adapted to the strangeness of this season. It is at this point that the consequences of all the chaos and unpredictability of the last seven months are made flesh, and it is a race that is all but impossible to sort — at least not yet. “It will go until the last day,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Everton manager, said last month. The challenge, he said, is to make sure you are still in contention by then. .A glance at  . would indicate that two of the seven Champions League contenders — Manchester United and Leicester City — have a considerable advantage. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United has an eight-point lead on West Ham, currently the first team outside the places in fifth. Brendan Rodgers’s Leicester side has a seven-point cushion. .But in Leicester’s case, certainly, that head start could yet be canceled out by the fact that its remaining schedule is considerably steeper than some of its rivals’. Leicester faces Manchester City this weekend before traveling to West Ham. Three of its final four games are against direct rivals for a spot in the top four: trips to Manchester United and Chelsea, and a home game against Tottenham. Rodgers’s team surrendered a place in the top four on the final day last season; this year’s calendar brings with it the ghost of past regrets. .No other team has quite such an arduous finish to the campaign, though Chelsea is close. The extent of Thomas Tuchel’s impact at Stamford Bridge will be gauged by visits to West Ham and Manchester City, and looming home games against Arsenal and Leicester. .If the calendar is kindest to anyone, it is Liverpool, marooned in seventh after a dismal run since late December. That may prove scant solace for a team that has spent the last three months losing at home to Fulham, Brighton and Burnley, but it at least gives Jürgen Klopp’s side a slim chance of returning to Europe. .If anything has marked this season, it is the capriciousness of crisis. It is barely two weeks since José Mourinho  . his Tottenham players of being unable to display “the basics of football and the basics of life” during a humiliation at the hands of Dinamo Zagreb in the Europa League. Now he may wonder if being out of that competition is not such a bad thing. .Nine league games remain of Spurs’ season, and Mourinho must also make room for the Carabao Cup final on April 24. But, that aside, he has a clear run. So, too, do West Ham and Everton. Leicester has one extra game than its rivals — an F.A. Cup semifinal — but the rest have more demanding commitments to juggle. .Chelsea, for one, is still fighting on three fronts: An F.A. Cup semifinal against Manchester City beckons, as well as a two-legged Champions League quarterfinal with F.C. Porto. Should Chelsea reach the final of both competitions, it would have to play almost twice as many games as some of its rivals. .Liverpool has a Champions League quarterfinal, too — a more arduous pairing, against Real Madrid — and Manchester United will be expected to reach the final of the Europa League, adding another five games to its schedule. At the end of a season that has been particularly demanding, the strain of any added workload to tired legs may prove crucial. .That injury has proved a defining factor in the outcome of this Premier League season is neither surprising nor particularly debatable. The root of Liverpool’s collapse lies in its loss of its central defense; Leicester’s form stuttered with the absence, at various times, of Jamie Vardy, James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, among others; Everton’s results dipped when James Rodríguez was missing. .It would be reasonable, then, to assume that the next two months will be decided by  ., particularly to their key players. Liverpool, of course, is still missing Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip. Tottenham is without Son Heung-min. Leicester is without Barnes, Maddison and James Justin, while Manchester United is sweating on Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial. .Injuries can, of course, be sheer misfortune — a bad tackle, a mistimed movement — but they can also be cumulative, the effect of a player pushed too far into what Arsène Wenger used to call the “ ..” But that is not the only consequence of fatigue. Even if injury is avoided, performance can dip. .It is this, more than anything, that should give Solskjaer and Manchester United pause. United’s captain, Harry Maguire, has played 3,946 minutes this season, an order of magnitude greater than every other outfield player in England. He has played the equivalent of five full games more this season than his nearest rival, Leicester’s Youri Tielemans. .But Maguire is not alone. United has seven players who have played more than 2,700 minutes this season. Leicester and Everton have only one, Chelsea two, and Spurs and West Ham three. Even Liverpool, its options reduced because of all those injuries, has only five. If fatigue does prove to be a factor, the core of United’s side is more likely to be afflicted in the final stretch than anyone else. .To some extent, of course, that is offset by its resources: Solskjaer has options should any of his key players be sidelined or suffer an alarming drop in form. Having to play Donny van de Beek because Bruno Fernandes needs a rest should be no great sacrifice. .Indeed, that may well be the formula, more than any other, that comes to define the next two months, that serves to find the signal in the noise of this season. More than in any other season, the final prize on offer in the Premier League will go to the teams that can best minimize the effects of fatigue, thanks to a reduced workload or by possessing the strength in depth to ride it out. In all the chaos, in the end, there will be some sort of order.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/soccer/premier-league-champions-league-places.html

"A Virus Races Through the Horse World. No, Not That Virus.","Shortly after arriving from abroad last month, Dr. Kent Allen’s new patient spiked a low fever. The doctor inserted a sterile swab into his patient’s nostril, a P.C.R. test to determine if this was yet another case of a potentially deadly virus sweeping the globe. .Then the patient went back to eating his hay. .The gray Irish Sport Horse, named McCoy, tested negative for an illness currently devastating European equestrian sports. An outbreak of a neurological form of the common equine herpes virus has killed nearly 20 horses and sickened over 100 more. It has forced the shutdown of competitions across 10 European countries. .With eerie echoes of the human coronavirus and the current pandemic, the virulent equine virus, which can kill a horse in less than 24 hours, has raced through the sport horse industry at a time when experts say it can least afford it: The shutdowns to stop the spread of the virus, known as E.H.V., come after nearly a year of shutdowns in the face of Covid-19. The coronavirus closed barns and canceled international championships, including last year’s World Cup Finals for dressage and show jumping, an important Olympic proving ground. .The event was to take place this week in Gothenburg, Sweden. Instead, on March 12, it was canceled again. .“On the back of Covid, which is of course still having a devastating impact worldwide, this E.H.V.-1 outbreak has been particularly tough,” Dr. Goran Akerstrom, the veterinary director of the Fédération Equestre Internationale, or F.E.I., the international governing body of equestrian sports, said in an email. “Particularly for those that have lost horses.” .He added, “To lose the F.E.I. World Cup Finals two years in a row — and to two different viruses — has been incredibly hard.” .The outbreak began at an international competition in Valencia, Spain, in late February, killing several top German show horses on the grounds. Organizers locked down some of the 752 animals in attendance, but some riders had left with their animals for their home countries — unwittingly taking the virus with them. The virus has since been identified in 10 nations — Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Slovakia and Qatar — possibly linked to the Valencia event. The United States has been spared, so far. .“I still can’t believe that we had no opportunity to help you,” Tim-Uwe Hoffmann, a German rider, wrote on Instagram in tribute to his mare, Casta Lee FRH, who died after testing positive at the Valencia show. .The F.E.I. has ordered international competitions on mainland Europe shut until at least mid-April. Nearly 4,000 horses who were in contact with potentially contagious animals after the show in Valencia have been ordered isolated for 21 days by the federation, which is conducting a sweeping test-and-trace initiative across European farms. After the isolation ends, they must return a negative P.C.R. test to return to competition. .“It was basically a textbook superspreader event,” Dr. Allen, McCoy’s owner, said of the Valencia competition. Dr. Allen is a veterinarian based in Middleburg, Va., who also serves as the F.E.I.’s head veterinarian for the United States. .The equine herpes virus is not a new enemy; it is endemic in the horse population and typically manifests as a runny nose and fever. But the version that has raced through barns after the Spain outbreak is far more deadly. It invades the central nervous system and causes myeloencephalopathy, or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The death itself, veterinarians say, is swift but brutal. .Biosecurity can be difficult: Shed virus can be spread by touch, on clothing and down a barn aisle by a snorting horse. While horses are routinely vaccinated for herpes, which affords some protection, the vaccine does not necessarily stop them from shedding virus. The virus can incubate in an animal for nearly a month, causing no signs of distress. Sick horses can test negative; asymptomatic horses can spread the disease. .For years, competition organizers and riders have largely paid lip service to biosecurity measures like sanitizing shared areas and keeping foreign animals apart, according to veterinarians and show staff. Pathogens are spread readily in a sporting environment where horses routinely swap stalls when stabled at competitions, nibble the same grass and touch noses beside the arena. .“You’d talk biosecurity measures, and their eyes would glaze over,” Dr. Allen said. “It’s: ‘You send us that protocol, and we’ll shove it in the deepest depths of our filing cabinet.’” .But the trauma that humans have experienced for the past year may be their horses’ best defense: After over a year of social distancing, vigorous hand washing and masking, industry leaders say, the equine world is stepping up to stem the spread in a way that it did not in past outbreaks, such as one in Ogden, Utah, in 2011, which reached at least a half-dozen states before it was quelled .“In today’s climate with the Covid-19 pandemic, people are very aware of the need to practice biosecurity measures for themselves and were primed to take additional steps to keep their horses safe when protocols were recommended,” Dr. Stephen Schumacher, the chief administrator of U.S. Equestrian’s equine drugs and medications program, said in an emailed statement. .Those steps stateside have so far appeared to ward off an American outbreak. But the specter of the disease, which gets little reaction most years when it crops up, has set the American industry on edge. .In early March, at a competition at the World Equestrian Center in Ocala, Fla., news of a virus case in a horse that had competed at the facility sent frissons of anxiety through competitors, hundreds of whom had flocked to the show grounds, which opened this season for the first time. .Though there was no outbreak on the grounds, entries plummeted to 500, from over 2,000, shortly after the show alerted competitors about the ill animal, as riders packed up their horses and left, according to Dr. Larry Wexler, the competition’s official veterinarian. The entries have since rebounded. Through a publicist, an owner of the center, Roby Roberts, declined to comment. .This month, a quarter horse, a warmblood and an Arabian from separate stables in California tested positive for the neurological form of the virus, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center, exposing dozens of their stablemates. Cases have cropped up in places like Kentucky and New York, according to the center, as well as in Canada, where a larger outbreak forced several barns to quarantine in February. .It is unclear if the smattering of American cases is linked to the European illness, or merely incidences of the virus that routinely occur. In Europe, F.E.I. officials are optimistic that the worst has passed, but emphasize that there are still reasons for caution. .So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not suspended the importation of horses from affected countries. Smaller nations like Jamaica, where an outbreak might overwhelm the limited horse population, banned imports in an attempt to keep the virus from its shores, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries’ veterinary services division. .So when McCoy, the gray Irish sport horse gelding, which Dr. Allen imported for his wife, Dr. Rae Stone, spiked a fever shortly after arriving on American soil last month, Dr. Allen whipped out a nasal swab. .“It was no big deal,” Dr. Allen said after the P.C.R. test came back negative for the herpes virus. Still, he said, he had to wonder: “When that is going on the European continent, and you’re importing horses over here, are you importing problems?”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/olympics/equestrian-horse-virus-deaths.html
Want to Go to Europe This Summer? Here Are Your Options,"With the number of people in the United States vaccinated against the coronavirus climbing, Americans are starting to explore their prospects for international travel this summer, a season when Europe is traditionally a big draw. .Most of Europe has been off-limits to most U.S. citizens for over a year, and the continent is currently grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections and a surge in new, more contagious variants, making it unclear when its borders will reopen. But some European countries have started to welcome  ., including American tourists, and others are making preparations to ease restrictions in time for the summer season. .Vaccine and health certificates that would help speed travel are under development, which could make it easier for tourism to restart. The 27 member countries of the European Union have endorsed the idea of a vaccine certificate. While individual European countries will still set their own rules, the initiative is expected to establish a coordinated approach across the continent. .“Finally, we have a tangible solution to coordinating and harmonizing travel measures,” said Eduardo Santander, chief executive of the  . an association of national tourism organizations based in Brussels. “I think other countries like the U.S. will also come up with their own technological solutions that will be compatible and after a period of trials this summer, a global standard will be established.” .In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still recommending against travel — even for those vaccinated — citing the risks of catching and spreading the virus while away from home. And ultimately, the course of the virus will determine what travel looks like across the world. But here’s what we know about how European countries are preparing to restart tourism. .Last summer, when the United States reported more coronavirus infections and deaths than any other country, Americans were barred from entering the European bloc for vacation. .There have been a few exceptions: Turkey has been letting U.S. citizens enter if they produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 PCR test before departure, as has Croatia, and several countries that are not members of the European Union,  .As the number of cases has risen in Europe, and vaccination has been sluggish, several European Union countries have gone back into lockdown. France, Belgium and Portugal have reintroduced stringent measures that restrict nonessential travel, even from within the bloc and within what is known as the Schengen Zone, which includes nonmember countries that allow free movement across their borders. .“Right now, in some European countries, it might feel like you are in the middle of a storm, which is how we felt in the U.K a couple of months ago,” said Gloria Guevara Manzo, chief executive and president of the  ., a forum that works with governments to raise awareness about the travel industry. .“But I think once we accelerate the vaccination rollout while applying strong safety protocols and testing, then by the summer we will be in a situation where European countries will be able to open up around the same time,” she added. .But that’s likely to be for travel within Europe, rather than between Europe and the United States. .“The current focus is on opening up internal markets within the E.U and U.K. and then depending on reciprocity agreements, more third countries will be included,” said Eric Dresin, Secretary General of the  .. “But right now, we are not talking about Americans visiting Europe.” .American travelers do have some options, though: Having brought the virus under control, Iceland is allowing all vaccinated travelers — including those from the United States — to enter without being subject to Covid-19 testing or quarantine measures. .Greece, one of the most popular European summer destinations for Americans, announced this month that it would reopen for all tourists in mid-May, as long as they show proof of vaccination, antibodies or a negative Covid-19 test result before traveling. All visitors will be subject to random testing upon arrival. .Turkey said it would not require international travelers to be vaccinated this summer and will re-evaluate testing policies after April 15. .Other European countries like Slovenia and Estonia are letting in vaccinated tourists, but not those from the United States. .Spain, which relies heavily on tourism for its economy, said it would reopen to international visitors in the spring, once between 30 and 40 percent of its adult population is vaccinated. Portugal is also hoping to reopen its borders by May, but it is not yet clear whether Americans will be allowed in. .Americans were never barred from entering the United Kingdom, which left the European Union last year, during the pandemic and can visit today, but face strict testing and quarantine requirements. In England, where a 10-day quarantine is required, the time can be reduced if a person presents a negative Covid-19 PCR test on day five. .Violations can result in penalties of up to $13,860 and 10 years in prison. .Most of Britain is under strict lockdown and while a stay-at-home-order is to be lifted on March 29, most shops, restaurants and pubs will stay closed until at least mid-April. Scotland has started to ease restrictions and will continue to do so in phases. .Domestic tourism and indoor dining is not expected to resume until May 17 at the earliest. In anticipation of restrictions being lifted,  . “staycation sailings” around the British Isles starting in June. .Many Britons traveled last summer when the virus seemed to have ebbed, and a recent study found that they brought a significant number of infections back into the United Kingdom. A ban on British travel abroad for leisure was enacted on Jan. 4 and was expected to expire in May, but the government introduced legislation this week that lays down the legal framework to extend the restrictions until the end of June. .It is not clear when exactly the United Kingdom will lift its quarantine requirements for more tourism, but  . forecasts a slow recovery that will start toward late summer. .Earlier this month, the  . proposed a digital travel certificate that would prove that a person has been vaccinated, received a negative Covid-19 test result or recovered after contracting the virus. .To travel to the European Union, you will have to tick one of the three boxes. .The document, known as a Digital Green Certificate, would allow European Union residents and their family members to travel freely within the bloc’s member states. The commission is also working to coordinate with the World Health Organization to make sure that the certificates are compatible with systems in countries outside Europe. .The documents would be free and available in digital or paper format and if approved by the European Parliament, the bloc plans to roll them out within three months. .Non-European Union nationals will be able to request a Digital Green Certificate from the member country they plan to visit. The rules for proof of vaccinations will be the same as for European Union nationals: Vaccines that the bloc has authorized will be accepted and individual member states will be able to decide whether to accept others. .“The Digital Green Certificate will not be a precondition to free movement, and it will not discriminate in any way,” said Didier Reynders, the bloc’s top official for justice. “A common E.U.-approach will not only help us to gradually restore free movement within the E.U. and avoid fragmentation. It is also a chance to influence global standards and lead by example based on our European values like data protection.” .Currently, all airline passengers age 2 and older traveling to the United States must provide a negative Covid-19 viral test (NAAT or antigen test) taken within three calendar days of travel.  ., so travelers should check what their state requires before booking a vacation abroad. .Each country sets its own rules, but most safety protocols are unlikely to change this summer, even for those who have been vaccinated. .Visitors will be expected to wear masks and keep a safe distance in public spaces. Hotels, restaurants and event spaces will have enhanced cleaning protocols in place, and some may impose capacity restrictions. .“I think it’s very important that governments strike a balance of easing restrictions this summer, while maintaining safety protocols to control the disease,” Mr. Santander of the European Travel Commission said. “We really don’t want to find ourselves in a situation in 2022 where we have to close borders again and go into lockdown for another year.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/travel/europe-travel-covid-vaccine.html
"The Yankees Start 2021 With Some Enthusiasm, and a Loss","Twenty minutes before Gerrit Cole threw the first pitch of the 2021 Major League Baseball season on Thursday, his teammate, D.J. LeMahieu, emerged from the Yankees’ dugout and jogged to the outfield to stretch. He was met with something absent from Yankee Stadium since October 2019: applause and cheers from fans. .For the first time in what has felt like forever for many, baseball was back in New York in a fashion that resembled normality. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Yankees performed for a television-only audience last year. Now in what is hoped to be the downslope of the pandemic, Yankees fans were allowed to return to see their World Series hopeful team in person. .In front of a crowd of 10,850 fans, the Yankees fell to the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-2, in 10 innings. Nick Nelson, the Yankees relief pitcher, surrendered the go-ahead run on a double to Randal Grichuk. But there is less reason for Yankees fans to worry about any individual loss this season: M.L.B. teams are scheduled to play their traditional 162-game regular season unlike the pandemic-shortened, 60-game season last year. .“It wasn’t the result we wanted, but having that buzz, having that energy back in the stadium was something special that we all enjoyed,” Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said. “I was talking with the guys and a couple umpires. Everybody missed it.” .While the Blue Jays are expected to present a formidable challenge this season, the Yankees are widely considered the best team in the American League East and one of the favorites to win the World Series. Armed with one of the most powerful lineups in baseball and a deeper starting rotation than before, the Yankees hope to end a championship drought that enters its 12th season despite their prodigious talent and spending. .“The expectations with the Yankees never really change every year,” said Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, the only player from the 2009 World Series-winning team on the current roster. “We’ve got our eyes set on the ultimate prize and obviously it’s been way too long since we’ve been back to the World Series.” .With a similar cast of characters to this year’s team, the Yankees struggled with injuries and inconsistency last season. They went 33-27 and failed to repeat as American League East champions, finishing second to the Tampa Bay Rays. Their season ended in familiar fashion, with a loss to the Rays in second round of the playoffs. After each early postseason exit, Judge has called the year a failure, a shortcoming he has said he thinks about every day. .This season and next are critical for the current group of Yankees. Several key players — Judge, catcher Gary Sanchez, pitcher Aroldis Chapman and others — are eligible for free agency after the 2022 season. .“A lot of our outstanding core players are really smack dab in the middle of the prime of their careers so we understand the urgency, the importance of playing well, and that all feeds into the hunger that exists with this team,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said recently. “They’ve tasted a lot of success but have also come up short a lot.” .To get over the hump and improve their roster, the Yankees’ most significant additions over the winter were adding high-risk, high-reward starting pitchers Corey Kluber and Jameson Taillon, who combined to throw one inning last season because of injuries. .Still, the Yankees’ pitching staff has fewer holes than the Blue Jays’ on paper. But on Thursday, the Yankees’ lineup couldn’t solve a Blue Jays bullpen that was without closer Kirby Yates, who will miss the entire season because of elbow surgery. .Hoping to bounce back from an awful 2020 season, Sanchez smashed his first career opening-day home run, a two-run blast off Blue Jays starter Hyun-jin Ryu that gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the second inning. But Cole, with his family from California in the stands, coughed up a game-tying home run to Teoscar Hernandez in the sixth on a hanging slider over the heart of the plate. .“I just want that slider back,” Cole said. .The Yankees’ lineup threatened throughout the game but couldn’t capitalize. In the 10th inning, the Blue Jays broke through. To cut down on the length of games during the pandemic, M.L.B. and the players’ union implemented rules in which extra innings begin with a runner on second base. On the second pitch he saw, Grichuk doubled home Jonathan Davis, while the Yankees struck out three times to end the game. .Despite the loss, Cole said he was happy this season began on time and with fans in the stands. Earlier in the week, Cole said playing with artificial crowd noise and fan-less stadiums last year was surreal. .“It was something that you didn’t really realize would have as much of an impact as it did,” he said. “We’re more grateful to be able to share this experience with the fans going forward. It’s something that I’ll always remember. And every time I see a fan or sign an autograph for a kid, I’ll remember that at one point this was taken away from us.” .Fans, though, were perhaps too eager to see Judge again. After he caught a ball at the wall in foul territory to end the top of the ninth inning, a fan tried to reach into Judge’s glove. .“It’s their first time back at a stadium in a long time,” Judge said. “I’ll give them that one.” .Others were simply happy to back in familiar surroundings. In Section 224, Michael Mayer, a North Jersey native wearing a Derek Jeter jersey, sat with his girlfriend, Lia Bella. Since he was a child, Mayer came to opening day every year with his father. But last year was the first season opener he said he hadn’t attended since 1985. .So when  . that the Yankees could host fans at a limited capacity to start the season, Mayer, 40, and Bella, 35, vowed to be in the stands. During Thursday’s game, Mayer smiled as he held a sign that Bella made. It read: “Just happy to be here.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/yankees-blue-jays-opening-day.html

FIFA Has a Plan for Africa. But Who Does It Serve?," Something strange has happened, Tariq. A few weeks ago, someone drew my attention to a  . from Barbara Gonzalez, the chief executive at Simba, one of the biggest clubs in Tanzania, that seemed to reveal a plan that would change the face of African soccer: a pan-continental super league. .But that’s not the strange part. The strange part is that it turns out it’s the brainchild of Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president. As a general rule, making sure you’re on the opposite side of any argument from Infantino is a solid strategy. But in this case my instinct is to say that, at least as an idea, this kind of makes sense. .Please explain to me why I am wrong, so that the world can be restored to its axis. . As with everything when it comes to FIFA — and typically FIFA under Gianni Infantino — the devil is in the detail. Or, in this case, the lack of detail. .Infantino first announced his big idea for Africa  ., but it had been dormant until this random tweet (more on that in a minute). But when Infantino first went public, people inside FIFA say there was no business plan: just Gianni firing from the hip, claiming it could generate $200 million in revenue. That’s a big number as far as African club football is concerned, but there is no evidence of where it came from. .It reminds me of the time Gianni walked into a FIFA Council meeting and told the board to sign a document that would allow him to sell the Club World Cup to private investors (who turned out to be SoftBank). The members, led by European officials, wanted details. An internal audit found the event was worth considerably less than Gianni had suggested. .Now, back to the tweet: It turns out FIFA officials were surprised, too. Barbara González walked up to Gianni at the Confederation of African Football Congress and asked to have her photo taken with him. Five minutes later, she sent out the tweet. Now I’m not saying a league in Africa is a bad idea, but surely there must be a robust plan before such a major project is undertaken? . If nothing else, you have to admire the chutzpah of that, not least because Infantino strikes me as  .the sort of person who would fall for the old “as you were saying” ruse. .There does, as you say, have to be a robust plan: economically, of course, but in a sporting sense, too. The basic idea strikes me as sound. Certainly south of the Sahara, African club soccer struggles horribly for investment. That means that the vast majority of nations that produce a constant stream of players for European clubs rarely see any of that talent on show in domestic leagues. That, in turn, hardly entices fans to go and watch games live. And that completes a neat but vicious circle, because it means that, yes, clubs struggle horribly for investment. .A Super League would address some of those issues. A better television deal, if nothing else, would enable clubs to invest in infrastructure. That might help nurture young talent and keep it for a little longer. It doesn’t seem impossible to me that a Pan-African league might be able to rival one of the talent-generating leagues in Europe — the Netherlands or Portugal, say — for quality in a relatively short space of time. .Of course, there is one thorny issue that I haven’t yet had the nerve to bring up. I reckon I could come up with a fairly cogent list of 20 or so African teams that would have a good case for inclusion, thanks to history or support or location. But I am guessing that Infantino and CAF, which is now run by a staunch ally of his, might have a different system in mind? . The little we know so far is that there is an expectation that participating teams would have to invest at least $20 million per season, for five seasons. For clubs in Africa, that is a significant outlay, and it suggests it would not be the most popular teams, so much as the ones that have the backing of wealthy benefactors. But again: Beyond the odd tweet and Gianni’s off-the-cuff remarks, we have nothing concrete. .There are other ways of trying to come up with likely participants. You could use the CAF club coefficient, which is essentially a points system for clubs in the region based on their historic success. But that would mean a league dominated by clubs from wealthier North African countries, with only a dozen or so of the continent’s 54 countries likely to be represented. . That lack of representation would, I think, ultimately be unavoidable. For a tournament like this to be valid, there are certain clubs that would have to be included. Al Ahly and Zamalek from Cairo, would be names one and two. Both Raja and Wydad from Casablanca, and Esperance and Étoile du Sahel, the twin totems of Tunisian soccer. .You would certainly need South Africa’s Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. And you could throw Mamelodi Sundowns in there, too: It is owned by Patrice Motsepe, Infantino’s ally and the new CAF president. Simba, of Tanzania, clearly expect to be involved. TP Mazembe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, would have to be. .Beyond that, the continent’s powerhouse nations — Cameroon, Senegal, Algeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and, particularly, Nigeria — would command at least one place each. Suddenly, the whole thing looks pretty full, even before thinking about Angola, Sudan and Ethiopia. . If there was a method to wrap this league into the existing pyramid, there would probably be far more buy-in. The idea that teams from across the region would have — at least in theory — a shot at one day making it into the competition would make the proposition far more palatable to those, even among the larger clubs, who are not enthused about it. .Even then, there are the logistics of it: not only to create a level playing field, but a sensible calendar and schedule, given the enormous differences in weather and transport infrastructure across the region. Given the uncertainty and sense of unease among the African football community, there needs to be an urgent and transparent discussion about what this is, and what this is not. A series of clandestine meetings followed by a high-profile announcement that does not stand up to scrutiny is not enough. . There is, definitely, a back-of-a-cigarette-packet air to the idea. And worse still, it has the feel of something that is being imposed on Africa, rather than generated from within it. The problem of representation bears that out: this sort of thing is much easier to conceive if, deep down, you regard Africa as a single, homogeneous entity, grateful for your interest. .And that — given Infantino’s apparent passion for the idea — makes you wonder what the purpose of it all is. Has it been suggested in an attempt to make African domestic soccer stronger, a challenging but essentially admirable aim? Or is there something else at play here? . There’s a suspicion that Gianni’s motivations may be less to do with securing the future of African soccer and more his hopes of creating a club competition that can rival and, eventually, overtake the Champions League. For that to happen, the expanded Club World Cup needs teams from all over the world who can compete with the powerhouses of Europe. .In that light, Africa might just be the start, the canary in the coal mine. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but those involved should be clear about their intentions. And a defining project for the future of African soccer should be guided by those with skin in the game, no question, rather than a Swiss bureaucrat intent on a legacy project. . Ah, that’s a relief. I feel as though I am on much more solid ground now: the idea might have some merit, but the rationale behind it may not. That may not be good news for African soccer, which finds itself being used as a pawn in a broader power game, but it’s good news for my personal moral compass, because it means I don’t have to worry about being on the same side of an argument as Gianni Infantino. .There was, just as there was always going to be, one last hurdle to clear. Most European soccer executives were expecting a blueprint for a new vision of the Champions League to be approved — both by UEFA, the competition’s organizer, and the European Clubs Association, Andrea Agnelli’s bad-idea factory — and announced this week. .That had to be pushed back, though, when several of the continent’s major teams blew up the deal at the 11th hour: It turns out that actually they want to have final say on the competition’s commercial rights, too. Suddenly, it seems as if the new-look Champions League may end up being the lesser of two evils. .Quite how that revamped competition will work is laid out clearly and concisely — and, crucially, in the form of a graphic —  .. So clearly and concisely, in fact, that for the first time it is possible to say without fear of having missed something that this iteration of the Champions League will make the tournament immeasurably worse. .Not, though, for the reasons so often given. Yes, there will be more meetings between the game’s superpowers, and for lower stakes. Yes, the whole thing is bloated. Yes, it will starve domestic competitions of oxygen. And yes, it still might serve to entrench the financial inequality that is the real enemy of the game’s ongoing health. .But the main problem is much simpler: The redesign reduces the Champions League’s competitive integrity. It is, essentially, invalid to draw up a league table in which all of the teams play different opponents. It renders it meaningless. And it is quite likely that fans, who are not as stupid as they are taken to be, will notice. .A few days ago, as England threatened to run up the score in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino, the poacher-turned-pundit Gary Lineker suggested it was time to admit that these mismatches — which characterize a substantial amount of international soccer — were of benefit and interest to precisely nobody. .Instead, he said, perhaps it would be in everyone’s interests for some of Europe’s smaller nations to engage in a prequalifying tournament, playing one another for the right to face the continent’s elite, and England. The reaction — Do I really need to say this? You know what the reaction is, because it’s always the same reaction — was furious. .To Lineker’s critics, those who accused him of trying to ghettoize soccer’s underdogs, what followed was karmic retribution.  .. Spain needed a late goal  .. Latvia  .. And, best of all,  ., the country’s first loss in a World Cup qualifier for 20 years. .It goes without saying that all of these results were welcome, impressive, and hilarious. But it does not mean that the idea Lineker espoused — one that has been around for years — should be dismissed. .First of all: That is how qualifying works in Africa, Asia and North and Central America. It helps to thin the calendar a little, something that matters at a time when players are being run into the ground by all of the teams they represent. Second: The success of the Nations League has shown that games between smaller nations are more competitive, and therefore both more entertaining and more educational, than watching the same teams be steamrollered by the giants. .And third: At the same time as all those shocks were rumbling through Europe, England was scoring five against San Marino, the Czechs ran in six in Estonia, and both Belgium and Denmark scored eight, against Belarus and Moldova. Worse still, a team managed by Frank de Boer  .. Some of soccer’s lesser lights are competitive. Some are not. If only there was a way of selecting which teams fell into which categories. .We have been here before. On Thursday, it emerged that Mino Raiola and Alfie Haaland — respectively the agent and the father of Erling Haaland, the goal cyborg — were in Catalonia for a meeting with Joan Laporta,  .. The race for the hottest property in European soccer is, it seems, on. .It is a move straight from the playbook that eventually led the younger Haaland to Borussia Dortmund, his current home, about 15 months ago. Expect Raiola and Haaland’s father to turn up in relatively short order in Madrid, too. They will almost certainly stop off in London after that: Chelsea harbors hopes of signing the 20-year-old Haaland. They may need two days in Manchester; they would not want to rush United or City. .The fact that they are doing their due diligence on their client/son’s next home is, then, no surprise. More eye-catching is the fact that they feel Barcelona’s hopes of signing Haaland are valid, given that Dortmund has made it plain that it will not sell him for less than $150 million, and because Barcelona is, well, currently  .. .Laporta, clearly, feels he can make a deal work. Perhaps he can. Perhaps there is some way of shifting the money around enough for Barcelona to remain a viable candidate. The appeal is obvious: Signing Haaland would, almost at a stroke, turn Barcelona into major players again. But then so, too, is the problem: After all the club has been through, would it really be a good idea? .Aside from the virgin hope of opening day — and possibly the breathless frenzy of Christmas — this is the best part of the soccer season. The end of the March international break heralds not only the arrival of spring, but the start of European club soccer’s race to the summit. Over the next two months, closure will arrive. .Better yet, this time around, we hit the ground running. The top two in both France and Germany will meet on Saturday: first, Lille visits Paris St.-Germain, the two of them level on points, and only a nose ahead of Lyon and Monaco. (I’ll have a story on Lille posting in a few hours.) No sooner has that finished, though, than RB Leipzig hosts a Bayern Munich deprived of Robert Lewandowski, and knowing that a win would close the gap at the top of the Bundesliga to a single point. .In England, meanwhile, the ultimate prize is off the table: It is a matter of when, not if, Manchester City claims a third title in four years. But the battle to finish second, third and fourth — and therefore obtain a place in next season’s not-yet-ruined Champions League —  .. My money would be on Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester, in that order, but it’s so close that it wouldn’t be much of my money. .Only space for one, this week, from  .. “I’m trying to figure out how much disappointment is warranted right now as a supporter of the United States,” he wrote. “How do you rate the U.S.A. men’s team’s failed attempts to qualify for Tokyo? There’s a lot of talk about the Olympics as a training ground for the next generation, but when I look at the U.S. squad, the next generation is playing senior friendlies in Europe.” .This is only a personal perspective, Charles, and it is a distinctly European one: My view would, I think, be different if I was South American or African. But in the narrow context of soccer, I’m not convinced the Olympics matter particularly. .It is special for the players to win a gold medal, of course, particularly when it at least rivals the high-point of that country’s soccer achievements thus far (Nigeria in 1996, Cameroon in 2000, Mexico in 2012) or when it is Argentina (2004 and 2008), and the World Cup brings nothing but misery. .But in terms of being used a signpost for greater things to come? In men’s soccer, no, not really. Put it this way: I had to check who won the gold at Rio in 2016. Turns out it was Brazil! They must have enjoyed that. It probably didn’t make up for what happened in a different tournament on home soil  .. .Women’s soccer, of course, has historically placed much more importance on it — the cover of Abby Wambach’s autobiography describes her as a gold medalist, rather than a World Cup winner — but I wonder if that, too, will change with the increased focus on the Women’s World Cup.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/soccer/fifa-gianni-infantino-africa.html
