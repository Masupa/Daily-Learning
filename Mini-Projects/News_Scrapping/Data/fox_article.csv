"Biden's $2T spending plan, billed as infrastructure bill, spends less than half on infrastructure"," $2 trillion   plan, which is being promoted largely as a bill to address  , directs well under half of its total money to things traditionally defined as infrastructure, according to a Fox News analysis.  The analysis, based on the 25-page summary of the president's proposal for the ""American Jobs Plan,"" indicates less than $750 billion of the spending fits even a broad definition of infrastructure.  The White House is casting a very wide net about what constitutes infrastructure — for example, the American Jobs Plan references ""care infrastructure"" when talking about $25 billion to upgrade child care facilities and a $400 billion expenditure on care for the elderly and disabled. That's quite different from repairing potholes and rebuilding bridges.  Senate Republicans, meanwhile, in emphasizing that Biden's plan largely does not address infrastructure, are often using a very restrictive definition of the word.  ""This plan is not about rebuilding America’s backbone. Less than 6% of this massive proposal goes to roads and bridges,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""It would spend more money just on electric cars than on America’s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined."" Indeed, the White House summary of the American Jobs Plan says it will spend ""$115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair"" out of more than $2 trillion in the plan. That is slightly under 6%.  But what counts and does not count as infrastructure can be tricky to define, according to Cato Institute Director of Tax Policy Studies Chris Edwards.  ""The first thing to know is there is no hard definition of infrastructure. Economists have no hard definition of infrastructure,"" Edwards said in an interview with Fox News.  Fox News' analysis of the Biden plan, as outlined in its 25-page fact sheet, broadly counted investments going toward physical repair or building of facilities and systems used by the general public that help the economy. This includes, for example, replacing lead pipes, expanding broadband access and modernizing public schools, in addition to money going to things traditionally associated with the word infrastructure like roads, bridges and ports.  Other items that counted to reach a total of just under $750 billion included $50 billion to preserve infrastructure resilience, $80 billion for Amtrak and $20 billion for road safety. Elements of the Biden plan Fox News excluded from this analysis included $174 billion being spent on electric vehicles; $400 billion on home-based care for the elderly and disabled; $25 billion on child care facilities; and $50 billion on ""research infrastructure"" at the National Science Foundation. Fox News also excluded $213 billion in Biden's plan that's directed at home sustainability and public housing; at least $35 billion aimed at R&D related to climate change; $50 billion to create a new office at the Department of Commerce to ""dedicated to monitoring domestic industrial capacity and funding investments to support production of critical goods;"" $30 billion to prepare for future pandemics; $45 billion for the federal government to buy clean energy goods; $14 billion ""to bring together industry, academia, and government to advance technologies and capabilities critical to future competitiveness;"" and several other provisions.  One part of Biden's plan that does not cost any money is the PRO Act, which would essentially override right-to-work laws in states across the country, allowing unions to extract dues from workers who do not want to be members.  Biden's American Jobs Plan, at this point, is simply a 25-page document of suggestions. Legislators have not even begun drafting it. That means dollar totals and specific allocations could change.  But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a comment Wednesday himself noted that the Biden plan includes much more than infrastructure.  ""Addressing infrastructure, climate and environmental justice together, and creating millions of good paying jobs, is just the right combination to meet head on the challenges that America now faces,"" Schumer said. ""This will not only make clean energy and clean transportation affordable, it will create millions of new jobs with good wages, which always occurs when we invest in infrastructure and manufacturing as we will be doing here."" Cato's Edwards, meanwhile, says his biggest gripe with the Biden plan is that the money being spent, no matter how it is defined, is largely going into the pockets of big corporations. ""It's hugely ironic because the leading Democrats have bashed corporate welfare and corporate subsidies for years, and they always claim that Republicans do corporate subsidies,"" Edwards told Fox News. ""But in fact, Biden would subsidize corporations hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars with this plan.""  ""Manufacturing, $300 billion. Electric vehicles, $170 billion. Broadband, $100 billion. Electric power grid, $100 billion. This is completely unneeded and it's also very dangerous because we don't want the federal government manipulating what broadband companies do, what electric power companies do,"" Edwards said.  He added: ""One of the interesting political things in coming weeks and months will be will the Democrat left, like Sanders and Warren, kind of come to the realization that, 'Hey, this is massive corporate subsidies here, which we're supposed to be against.'"" Edwards also said that the corporate tax hikes used to fuel the $2 trillion-plus spending plan would be counterproductive to its goals, hurting the massive private companies like ""AT&T and Verizon and other companies that do broadband and invest-- you know infrastructure investment."" ""Biden would be taking with one hand in taxes what he's giving on the other end, subsidies, which makes no sense,"" Edwards said.  Biden and the White House, of course, would dispute Edwards' points.  ""It's time to build our economy from the bottom-up and the middle-out, not the top-down,"" Biden said in remarks unveiling the plan in Pittsburgh Wednesday. ""And this time when we rebuild the middle class, we're going to bring everybody along regardless of your background, your color, your religion, where everybody gets to come along.""  ""The American jobs plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads and Main Streets that are difficult, difficult shape right now,"" Biden added. ""It will fix the nation's 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement."" ""Altogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs, estimated by some Wall Street outfits there will be 18 million jobs over four years, good-paying jobs,"" Biden also said in Pittsburgh. ""It also works to level the playing field to empower workers and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs, that you can raise a family on, and ensure a free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively."" The White House and press secretary Jen Psaki have indicated that they are open to negotiating with Republicans over Biden's spending plan. But it remains unclear how much Democrats would actually be willing to compromise on in order to secure Republican votes. ""I'm not going to give you red lines from here,"" Psaki told reporters on Thursday.  If Republicans and Democrats cannot come to the kind of agreement that can get the support of 10 Republicans and reach the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate, Democrats will likely be forced to move the package ahead via budget reconciliation. That process allows them to circumvent the filibuster and therefore avoid negotiating with Republicans,  ""I support improving America’s aging roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure. And we can do so in a bipartisan way,"" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. But, he said, Biden's plan includes ""these broad policy priorities that are a far cry away from what we’ve ever defined as infrastructure."" Psaki on Thursday, meanwhile, said she believes there is a lot to agree on in the White House's initial proposal when asked about comments from McConnell opposing it.  ""Does he disagree that our nation's infrastructure is outdated and needs repair? Does he disagree that we need to do more to put American workers back to work and to invest in industries that have growth potential over the long term? Does he disagree that one-third of the country who doesn't have broadband access should have access to broadband?"" Psaki said. ""There are a lot of areas where there is agreement with across the political spectrum.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-spending-plan-billed-as-infrastructure-bill-spends-non-infrastructure
Ingraham: Corporations who speak out against Georgia law should be treated as 'enemy of fair elections',"Democrats and big corporations like Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola and Apple are aligned with   and against Americans, Laura Ingraham warned Thursday.  All three companies have gone on the record against what "" "" host described as a ""common-sense""   election law that strengthens identification requirements and expands early voting opportunities across the Peach State. Those mild reforms, Ingraham said, didn't keep Delta CEO Edward Bastian and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey from firing back at Georgia in stark terms. ""We realize that this was restricting ... people's access, particularly in the Black community,"" Bastian said in a recent clip played by Ingraham. ""This is something that's more than money. This is about protecting the voices of our people."" By contrast, the host noted, companies like Coca-Cola recently lobbied against legislation that would have cracked down on imports from countries using slave labor, including China.  ""The love for democracy stops at the U.S. border,"" Ingraham said. Turning to Biden and his support for moving this year's Major League Baseball All-Star Game out of Atlanta, Ingraham asked viewers: ""Remember when Biden claimed he didn't want to wade into the culture wars during the campaign? He was going to unify the country, be the president of all Americans? ""That's obviously out the window. As I warned, they're going to use terms like 'Jim Crow' and they're going to lie but they will never talk about what's actually in the law,"" she added. ""The law requires voter ID for absentee ballots. It eliminates signature matching. It expands early voting opportunities. It keeps ballot drop boxes. It shortens the time between the general election and a runoff. It gives the state bar the power to remove corrupt election officials. These rules benefit Americans of every race."" Ingraham claimed the far left was ""working hand in glove with Hollywood, sports personalities, and big business to bully and intimidate Georgia for passing a law that they believe threatens Democrats' dreams of permanent rule."" In response, she said, ""every Republican member of Congress -- every single one, the House and the Senate, even Mitt Romney, every Republican governor -- should immediately speak out against this campaign."" Then, she said, ""it's time to teach corporate America that if they attack Georgia or any state like it for doing what they did to secure their right to vote, these corporations are going to face the wrath of GOP officials as well as the tens of millions of American consumers who support them. ""We will analyze every benefit you get under state and local law and eliminate as many of them as possible. If you threaten to leave for a blue state, we will hold open the door and bid you farewell. Pay their huge taxes. See if we care,"" she warned. ""Enjoy trying to comply with their antibusiness regulations. But don't ever ask us for help again when the left comes after you. Because you're going to be the enemy of fair elections and you're going to be treated as such.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/laura-ingraham-georgia-election-law-biden-delta-apple-coca-cola

Former Trump aide Max Miller raised 500K in one month in House race vs GOP member who voted to impeach," Max Miller, the former   aide mounting a primary challenge to     Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, raised more than $500,000 in approximately the first month of his campaign, Fox News has learned.  The four-week total underscores the powerful fundraising draw of the former president, who held an event for Miller at Trump International in Palm Beach. The average House campaign in 2018 cost about $2 million, according to  . Fox News has learned that Miller received contributions from more than 2,500 donors in all 50 states.  Miller announced his campaign against Gonzalez after the incumbent joined 10 other Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump for incitement of an insurrection over the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Shortly after Miller entered the race on Feb. 26, Trump enthusiastically endorsed his former aide, whose past roles include a spot on Trump's 2016 campaign, work in the Office of Presidential Personnel and as Deputy Campaign Manager for Presidential Operations.  ""Max Miller is a wonderful person who did a great job at the White House and will be a fantastic Congressman,"" Trump said in a statement through his Save America PAC. ""He is a Marine Veteran, a son of Ohio, and a true PATRIOT."" ""Current Rep. Anthony Gonzalez should not be representing the people of the 16th district because he does not represent their interest or their heart,"" Trump added. ""Max Miller has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" A representative for Miller, asked about the total the campaign raised at Trump's Palm Beach fundraiser, said the campaign is not disclosing the amount raised at specific events.  As first-quarter 2021 fundraising numbers streamed in on Thursday, it was clear that high-profile support or opposition to Trump helped multiple candidates raise money. Punchbowl News reported that Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., one of Trump's biggest supporters, raised about $500,000 in just four days during a visit to his home state.  Meanwhile, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who voted to impeach Trump and has made his name as a vocal Trump critic,   in the first quarter of 2021 -- $1.1 million for each his campaign and his political action committee.  Trump has said that he plans to back primary challenges to a variety of Republicans who have not been loyal enough to him. He's publicly called for voters in Wyoming, for example, to oust House GOP Conference Chair  Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in 2022.  Cheney is also the state's lone House member in Congress.  ""The good news is in her state she's been censured and in her state her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I've ever seen,"" Trump said in his speech at CPAC. ""So hopefully they'll get rid of her with the next election.""  Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile,   at CPAC that there are ""plenty"" of Senate Republicans he would like to see primary challenges against and that his father will ""get involved in picking individual races and individual people that have been supportive of him, and not others.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/former-trump-aide-max-miller-raised-500k-in-one-month-in-race-against-gop-member-who-voted-to-impeach

""I absolutely oppose and reject any notion of boycotting Georgia,"" Ossoff said. ""Georgia welcomes business, investment, jobs, opportunity, and events. In fact, economic growth is driving much of the political progress we have seen here. Georgia welcomes the world’s business. Corporations disgusted like we are with the disgraceful Voter Suppression bill should stop any financial support to Georgia’s Republican Party, which is abusing its power to make it harder for Americans to vote."" Ossoff first made the comments during a press conference in Atlanta Thursday and the senator's office confirmed the statement to Fox News on Friday.  Biden has called the new voting law ""sick"" and ""Jim Crow on steroids."" After a record-breaking turnout that led to Democrats winning Georgia in the presidential race and two Senate runoffs, the GOP-led Georgia legislature passed the new voting rules that supporters say will add integrity to the election system, but Democrats fiercely opposed as voter suppression tactics. The recently enacted law places new restrictions on voting by mail, adds voter ID requirements and limits ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting ahead of general elections, an increase from just one, and leaves two Sundays as optional. The law also bans outside groups from handing out food or water to those waiting in line to vote.  In addition to the pressure on sports, leaders of Coca-Cola and Delta, both headquartered in Atlanta, have made public statements in opposition to the new voting law.  Georgia's other newly elected Democratic senator, Raphael Warnock, on Sunday declined to oppose potential boycotts of Georgia-based corporations and sporting events, saying, ""We will see how that plays out."" In an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Warnock said he's ""not focused"" on the boycotts. ""I am focused on what I can do as a United States senator.""

Experts giving COVID 'lab leak' theory second look after mainstream media cried it was 'debunked',"Once dismissed by the   as a ""fringe"" and ""debunked"" theory, the suggestion that the devastating   leaked from a   superlab instead of jumping from animals to humans is no longer considered outlandish. Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director   said last week   the pathogen unintentionally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, a city known as a center for Chinese viral studies. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has also been known to perform experiments on bat coronaviruses. A repeatedly delayed joint World Health Organization-China investigation   the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"" last week, but experts are already questioning its conclusions due to the influence of the notoriously deceitful Chinese government. Even the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, much maligned for his   toward China at the outset of the pandemic, said the research team’s assessment on whether the virus entered the human population following a laboratory incident was not "" "" and requires further investigation. Numerous media outlets dismissed the idea last year, however, when it was initially   by  , R-Ark. The pushback against Cotton occurred during denunciations of Trump administration figures framing COVID-19 as a ""Chinese"" or ""Wuhan"" virus. Stories published by The   (""conspiracy theory that was already debunked""),   (""fringe theory""),   (""debunked fringe theory""), and   (""conspiracy theory"") aggressively disputed Cotton's hypothesis.  MSNBC host Brian Williams cited the Post on his program on Feb. 17, 2020, saying, ""Arkansas Republican Senator and loyal Trump ally Tom Cotton has waded into trouble by commenting on the coronavirus, which is proving virulent and deadly and is spreading fast. The Washington Post headline puts it this way: 'Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.'""  linked the theory to efforts by President Donald Trump to attack China over the virus outbreak, declaring it ""added a scary new layer to Donald Trump’s blame-China strategy."" HuffPost   that Cotton made ""unfounded allegations"" against the Chinese government for failing to stop the spread of the coronavirus, one of the most embarrassing examples of a liberal news outlet parroting pro-China propaganda to ding a conservative. Indeed,   China's authoritarian government silenced physicians and whistleblowers in the critical early weeks of the pandemic. The outlets at times conflated Cotton's belief it could have come from a lab with the notion China purposefully engineered a bio-weapon, which Redfield and Cotton have said they do not believe occurred. Rather, Redfield said the coronavirus's highly effective transmission ability suggested to him it had been experimented on in a laboratory. Liberal media figures, such as the Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin and Daily Beast's Molly Jong-Fast, delighted in piling on Cotton. ""The far right has now found its own virus conspiracy theory,"" left-wing CNN host Fareed Zakaria said on March 8, 2020, of Cotton's remarks. Three days later, CNN's John Vause declared Cotton's comments ""misinformation"" while interviewing infecious disease expert  . ""Well, I'm not going to comment about what any individual says. But in general, I can tell you that theories that are not based on evidence and facts often can really mislead people,"" Fauci said at the time.

""Tens of millions of Americans have had their lives upended over the last year. They have lost jobs. Their businesses have closed,"" he said. ""They have lost loved ones. I don't think those Americans want to simply turn the page and let bygones be bygones. We need to get to the bottom of what happened in Wuhan and how the Chinese Communists unleashed this plague on the world and we need to hold them accountable.""

A different Augusta National await newcomers from November,"Paul Casey needed only 11 holes to realize a Masters in November was an experience unlike any other at Augusta National. He had a 6-iron to a left pin on the par-5 second hole at Augusta National. Any other year — any April, really — he would have aimed well right of the flag. On this soft, autumn day, he took on the pin. The ball plopped down 6 feet away. ""You can't hit that shot in April,"" he said. ""That shot in April would have one-hopped over into the patrons."" Consider that a warning. For all but 19 players in the field, the Masters back in April should feel like it usually does. There are pins to attack. There are pins to avoid. It doesn't take much to get out of position. For someone like Sebastian Munoz, who made his debut last year, it could be about starting over. Munoz is among 13 players who played the Masters for the first time last November when it was postponed seven months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He had gone to Augusta National once before for a scouting trip after qualifying by winning the Sanderson Farms Championship. Just his luck, that practice round was in November, too. ""I think that's why I played good. I knew what to expect,"" Munoz said. He was 9-under par through 54 holes until closing with a 75 to tie for 19th. Sungjae Im set the record for lowest score by a newcomer at 15-under 273, a score that would have won all but eight of the previous 84 Masters. Munoz still recalls what Jon Rahm told him in the final round after one particular shot, a 4-iron into the par-5 15th that landed just in front of the hole and settled not far behind it: ""Anything you learn today, this week, forget about it."" ""I'm looking forward to it and debuting again,"" Munoz said with a laugh. Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 was the last player to win the Masters in his debut. Only three professionals — Carlos Ortiz, Robert MacIntyre and Will Zalatoris — and three amateurs are first-timers at this Masters. As for the 13 who have never played in April? It's not like they didn't gain any experience at all. ""I don't think we played a golf course that was similar,"" said Max Homa, who missed the cut. ""It was still nice to get out there and get the jitters over with. It's also a golf course I think everyone has watched more than any golf course on tour. You know a lot of spots where you need to leave it. You still saw where it can get you. ""I don't think it was rocket science that it was playing different,"" he said. ""I threw a 3-iron into 15 and it stopped on a dime. We knew that would happen. The best players in the world are really good at adapting."" The 15th hole gets most of the attention. That's where Rahm hit the 4-iron and Homa hit the 3-iron that stopped. Johnson spoke of one player in his group to hit a 3-wood that stopped where it landed, a shot he said that without an abundance of rain ""is not possible."" Adam Scott considered what the newcomers learned last year, such as the severe slope on the 13th fairway with the ball above their feet (for right-handed players) and various lines off the tee. ""Certainly, they're going to be seeing a few new shots that they'll have an opportunity to play, and some that you absolutely can't play,"" he said. The soft conditions of autumn — along with rain that forced a three-hour delay at the start — were reflected in the record scores, from the 20-under 268 by Johnson to the 1,122 birdies for the week. Justin Thomas believes Johnson would have won in any conditions. He was playing that well. What stood out to Thomas was the number of newcomers who did so well. Along with Im sharing second place, C.T. Pan tied for seventh and Abraham Ancer was in the mix until closing with a 76 to tie for 13th. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that some first-timers or younger guys played well, because a lot of the past experience was engrained in my memory,"" Thomas said. ""But at the end of the day, everyone had the same amount of time to prepare. Everyone knew what the golf course was, and it just about execution. But you had to go about differently than you do in April when it gets firm and fast."" Lanto Griffin played the opening two rounds with former Masters champion Vijay Singh, with whom he plays and practices at home in Florida. The stories were familiar. Griffin spoke of a 5-iron from the rough on No. 5 that came out hot, landed in the middle of the green and rolled harmlessly to the fringe. Singh told him that ball would have gone into the magnolia trees in April. ""I think it's easier when it goes from being really firm and fast to softer, versus soft and slow and then it speeds up,"" Griffin said. ""I know this year will be a completely different animal.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/a-different-augusta-national-await-newcomers-from-november
"Jones, Smith, Harris reconnect at Alabama's pro day No. 2","DeVonta Smith was there for quarterback Mac Jones once again, this time it was at Alabama's latest pro day. The Heisman Trophy-winning wide receiver seemed to have little left to prove for NFL teams on the field, but showed up Tuesday to help Jones out. Jones threw a series of different routes, including some deep balls, to players like favored targets Smith and tailback Najee Harris in his second outing before NFL personnel that included several head coaches and general managers. Smith was a late addition to the target list, though he's already regarded as a likely Top 10 pick. ""He didn't have to do that,"" Jones told the SEC Network, which aired the pro day. ""You watch the tape and he's great. But he called me this morning (Tuesday) and was like, ‘Dude, I got you. Let’s just get a couple of routes in.'"" Jones showcased his arm strength a week after participating in the  . He had a scripted series of some 60 throws, about a quarter of them deep ones. Jones said he had different plans prepared in case Smith and/or Jaylen Waddle participated, or if neither of them did. Waddle, also one of the top receiving prospects, didn't work out at the pro day. Smith had earlier indicated that he didn't plan to, either. Jones and Smith connected on several deep balls, continuing the smooth connection they displayed in the regular season. Smith said he wanted to show a finger he injured in the national championship game was healed. It kept him from playing or practicing at the Senior Bowl. At pro day, he said, ""The competitiveness came out in me."" So did the loyalty. ""Mac was just on me like, ‘Bro, come catch, come catch, come catch,’"" Smith told the network. ""And then I just eventually gave in and was like, ‘Ok, I’m going to do it for you, bro.'"" The head coaches in attendance included the New England Patriots' Bill Belichick, Sean Payton of the New Orleans Saints, Kyle Shanahan of the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago's Matt Nagy. Belichick was among a group of five general managers on hand, joined by the 49ers John Lynch, the Saints’ Mickey Loomis, the New York Jets' Joe Douglas and the Bears' Ryan Pace. Harris displayed the hands that helped him catch 43 passes as a senior before doing individual running back drills. He won the Doak Walker Award given to the nation's top running back, and joined Smith and Jones among the top 5 in the Heisman race. All four are projected as first-rounders in a draft when Alabama could have as many as six, including center cornerback Patrick Surtain Jr. and defensive lineman Christian Barmore. Most of Tuesday's session featured Jones launching passes with an array of routes, including a number of deep balls, to teammates like Harris, Smith and tight end Miller Forristall. He finished up by catching a short pass in the end zone from Harris. Jones also wanted to show he could make throws on the move, including a couple of off-balance, across-the-body passes. ""At Alabama, they told me to sit in the picket and rip it, so that's what I did,"" Jones said. ""That's what you're supposed to do when you're at Alabama. ""But when the NFL comes, I'll do whatever they tell me to do. I showed today that I can do everything that they want me to do.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/jones-smith-harris-reconnect-at-alabamas-pro-day-no-2
WWII vet knits wool hats during COVID-19 pandemic for Salvation Army,"A 96-year-old World War II veteran has dedicated the past 24 years of his life to   for those in need.  Once they're complete, Tom Cornish told Fox News he would send them to food shelters, hospitals, churches and to the homeless men and women he would see on the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota.  However, for the past six years, he's been directing his efforts to help the Salvation Army, which has been in desperate need of volunteers throughout the course of the pandemic.  Over the last year alone, Cornish said he's created at least 350 wool hats for the organization.  ""[Tom Cornish] believes that there is no retirement in your service,"" his daughter-in-law Marilyn Cornish told Fox News. ""You can serve all your life. There is no reason you should stop giving and serving."" Tom Cornish lives in the Twin Cities and has been volunteering since he was in high school. Knitting, however, was something he picked up 24 years ago after one of his kids bought him yarn and some loom, his son, Gerald Cornish, told Fox News.  On a good day, Tom Cornish can create a little more than two hats. Each one takes about four hours to complete, he says.  It's no easy task, but if you asked him, he'd joke: ""I've got nothing else better to do.""  His biggest motivation is giving back.  ""If I sit and look out the window, I would get something out of it but no one else would,"" he said. ""When I make hats or once in a while scarfs, someone is going to get a big benefit out of that."" And he's got plenty of yarn to do it. He said he still has three full boxes with other bags in his closet.  The Salvation Army, which has been giving the hats to hundreds of individuals within the Twin Cities, is in awe of his efforts.  ""Tom is an inspiration to us,"" added Lt. Colonel Dan Jennings, commander of The Salvation Army Northern Division. ""Here is a man who just wants to help people, and he is doing it the best way he knows how."" Jennings said Tom Cornish is evidence that ""everyone can do something to help those less fortunate."" And Tom Cornish has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.  ""I'm going to do this until I take my last breath,"" he said. ",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//us/wwii-vet-covid-pandemic-weaving-wool-hats-salvation-army
High court sympathetic to college athletes in NCAA dispute,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to give college athletes a win in a dispute with the NCAA over rules limiting their education-related compensation. With the   in its final stages, the high court heard arguments in a case about how   who play Division I basketball and football. Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and the scholarship money colleges can offer is capped at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA defends its rules as necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports. But the   including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, say the NCAA’s rules are unfair and violate federal antitrust law designed to promote competition. The outcome will help determine how college athletes are compensated and whether schools can offer tens of thousands of dollars in education benefits for things such as postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad opportunities and vocational school payments. During an hour and a half of   conducted  , both liberal and conservative justices   to students. Justice Elena Kagan suggested that what was going on sounded a lot like price fixing. ""Schools that are naturally competitors ... have all gotten together in an organization,"" she said, and used their power to ""fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed. He told a lawyer for the NCAA that ""it does seem ... schools are conspiring with competitors ... to pay no salaries for the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing."" Kavanaugh said that was ""somewhat disturbing."" A ruling for the former players would not necessarily mean an immediate infusion of cash to current college athletes. It would mean that the NCAA could not bar schools from sweetening their offers to Division I basketball and football athletes with additional education-related benefits. Individual athletic conferences could still set limits. Still, if the athletes were to win, there would be pressure on schools to offer additional benefits, and that could create bidding wars for the best players. The NCAA says that could turn off fans and erase the distinction between professional and college sports. Whatever happens at the high court, changes seem on the way for how college athletes are compensated. The NCAA is in the process of trying to amend its rules to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses. That would allow athletes to earn money for things like sponsorship deals, online endorsement and personal appearances. For some athletes, those amounts could dwarf any education-related benefits. The former college athletes have some big-time supporters. The players associations of the NFL, NBA and WNBA all urged the justices to side with the ex-athletes, as did the Biden administration. So far, the former players have won every round of the case. A decision in the case is expected before the end of June, when the high court traditionally breaks for summer.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/high-court-sympathetic-to-college-athletes-in-ncaa-dispute
Psaki doubles down on Biden's Georgia voting comments after major fact-check," press secretary Jen Psaki furthered the president's criticism of   new voting law even after a fact check determined his line of attack was false. President Biden had claimed that Georgia's law blocked people from providing voters with food and water while the stood in line. He also accused the Republican-led state was ending voting at 5 p.m., ""when people are just getting off work."" Georgia's law actually standardizes what's considered ""normal business hours"" to mean 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but still allowed counties to extend their voting hours to as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. It also allows poll workers to provide self-service water from an unattended receptacle within 150 feet but prohibits people from actively distributing food and drink within that distance.  On Thursday, Psaki didn't back down from Biden's comments, but rather defended them. ""It standardizes the ending of voting every day at five, right?"" Psaki asked FOX Business' Edward Lawrence while referring to the law. ""It just gives options. It gives options to expand it, right, but it standardized it at five. It also makes it so that outside groups can’t provide water or food to people in line, right?"" Her comments came after   gave Biden four pinocchios for his claim about voting times. ""Biden framed his complaint in terms of a slap at working people,"" The Post's Glenn Kessler wrote. ""The law would 'end voting at five o'clock when working people are just getting off work' or 'ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over.'"" ""Many listeners might assume he was talking about voting on Election Day, not early voting. But Election Day hours were not changed. As for early voting, the law made a modest change, replacing a vague 'normal business hours' — presumed to be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — to a more specific 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time period. But that's the minimum.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/psaki-doubles-down-georgia-voting-law

"Trout, Pujols lead Angels' late rally past White Sox, 4-3","Mike Trout smacked a single down the left-field line to drive in David Fletcher in the eighth inning, and Angel Stadium rocked with the roar of a crowd much bigger than the 13,207 masked people in attendance. The  ' first opening day win since 2013 felt big in almost every way to a team and a sport that could use some good news. Trout delivered the tying single and Shohei Ohtani scored the go-ahead run on Albert Pujols' groundout in the eighth inning, leading Los Angeles' rally to a 4-3 victory over the   on Thursday night. Max Stassi homered and Justin Upton had an RBI single in the Angels' first opening day at home since 2016. The Halos' late surge for two unearned runs thrilled Angel Stadium's first crowd since 2019, ended their embarrassing losing streak on opening day — and even spoiled the second debut of White Sox manager Tony La Russa. ""Felt like big league baseball again. It was great,"" Angels manager Joe Maddon said. ""(The) 13,000 fans felt like 40, 50, 60,000. ... Just a brilliant performance. For an opening night, that’s as good as it’s going to get with your team. If we keep playing that type of baseball, we’re going to win a lot of games."" Trout and Pujols came up big in the eighth against powerful Chicago reliever Aaron Bummer (0-1) in front of the biggest sports crowd in the Los Angeles metroplex since the start of the pandemic. ""It was nice having the fans back in the stands,"" Upton said. ""There was a lot of energy, and it kind of locks you in. Bummer has got great stuff, and we were just trying to fight him."" Fletcher opened the eighth by beating out an infield single off Bummer's glove. Second baseman Nick Madrigal then made a throwing error on a hard-hit grounder from Ohtani, and Fletcher took third on a passed ball before Trout smacked a single to left. Upton drew an 11-pitch walk to load the bases for Pujols, whose high-bouncing groundout easily scored Ohtani. Pujols’ RBI was the 16th of his career on opening day, the most among active players. ""(Bummer) does his job, gets groundballs, and the last run scored was on a chopper,"" La Russa said. ""That’s baseball. If you put the ball in play, good things happen, and it happened for them."" Mike Mayers (1-0) pitched the eighth, and Raisel Iglesias needed just eight pitches in the ninth to earn the save in his Angels debut. Adam Eaton hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in his first game back with the White Sox. Lucas Giolito retired the Angels’ first 11 batters and pitched two-hit ball into the sixth inning for Chicago. The Southern California native baffled the Angels’ lineup his first time through, striking out six of nine largely with his changeup. Giolito left with a 3-2 lead, but the Angels jumped on Bummer and kept new closer Liam Hendriks out of the game. ""Giolito threw a heck of a game and put us in position to win,"" Eaton said. ""Trout is barreling on 96 (mph), and Upton comes up and puts a really good at-bat together. Circumstances were tough, but that’s kind of how we drew it up for our (pitchers)."" Dylan Bundy yielded six hits and three runs with six strikeouts over six innings in his first opening day start for the Angels. White Sox: OF Adam Engel went on the 10-day injured list with a strained right hamstring, and LHP Jace Fry was placed on the 10-day IL to recover from a microdiscectomy. Angels: Ohtani’s potential blister on his throwing hand shouldn’t affect his ability to pitch Sunday, Maddon said. The 76-year-old La Russa is back in Chicago’s dugout 34 years after he was fired and nine years after he last managed in the majors with Pujols and the Cardinals. La Russa was a special adviser to the Angels’ front office last season. La Russa’s first significant strategy decision of the season perhaps showed a willingness to change with the times: He pulled Giolito after 87 pitches in the sixth inning so he wouldn’t face Trout a third time. Pujols went 0 for 4 with one huge RBI in the 21st opening day start of his career. The 41-year-old Pujols matched Eddie Murray and Al Kaline for the second-most opening day starts in baseball history, trailing only Pete Rose’s 23. Pujols is one of five players to make at least 10 opening day starts with the Angels. Garret Anderson holds the franchise record with 13, while Trout has started the last nine straight. Fletcher began his fourth big league season by going 1 for 4 with two uncharacteristic strikeouts as the Angels’ leadoff hitter and second baseman. He signed  earlier in the day. Dallas Keuchel looks to extend his career-long mastery over the Angels when he takes the mound against Andrew Heaney. Keuchel is 12-2 with a 3.36 ERA in 18 appearances against Los Angeles.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/trout-pujols-lead-angels-late-rally-past-white-sox-4-3
Emmert promises WBCA he will work to fix 'stark' inequities,"NCAA President Mark Emmert promised the Women's Basketball Coaches Association he will work with coaches to fix the ""stark difference"" between the Division I men's and women's tournaments. While Emmert noted that a major hurdle was trying to hold both basketball tournaments in kind of identical format required by the coronavirus pandemic, he added nobody liked the results and nobody wants to see similar issues crop up in other sports in coming months. ""I, too, believe that it’s exactly the right moment to do it,"" Emmert said. ""You got my commitment, my personal commitment to spend an enormous amount of time and energy on on this problem and and making sure that we don’t lose the chance."" Emmert and the NCAA's heads of basketball Dan Gavitt and Lynn Holzman discussed the conditions in San Antonio on Wednesday with members of the WBCA, including two of the Final Four coaches — UConn's Geno Auriemma and Dawn Staley of South Carolina. Several differences surfaced over the past two weeks, starting with female players, coaches and staff in San Antonio criticizing the NCAA for not initially providing a full weight-training area to the women’s teams, noting the men’s teams in Indianapolis did not have the same problem. Questions during the coaches' meeting with Emmert ranged from the use of ""March Madness"" for branding, the number of NCAA staffers for both basketball tournaments (12 for the men, six for the women), the budget for both tournaments and why the NCAA doesn't own the WNIT as it does the NIT. The WBCA sent a letter to Emmert last week saying the external review he proposed to look into potential gender equity issues wasn't good enough. In the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, the WBCA asked for a ""Commission on Gender Inequity in College Sports"" led by people chosen by both the WBCA and NCAA. Staley asked for assurances that the law firm hired by the NCAA to review potential gender equity issues is truly independent. ""Whoever is paying the piper, more than likely they’re going to give you what you want to hear,"" Staley said. Emmert said the Kaplan, Hecker & Fink law firm specializes in Title IX issues nationally and has no prior relationship with the NCAA. E  the firm would review potential gender equity issues in all men’s and women’s championship events with basketball a key focus. Muffett McGraw, who retired as Notre Dame head coach last year, said the WBCA has total confidence in Holzman. The former Irish coach noted the NCAA added a rule a few years ago holding head coaches accountable for anything that goes wrong and asked why Holzman doesn't report directly to Emmert. ""In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio,"" McGraw said. ""This is way deeper than that."" Auriemma said the bigger issue isn't an NCAA problem but exists on individual campuses with presidents and athletic directors. He asked Emmert what he could do to make sure those people give women's basketball the same advantages and opportunities. The UConn coach also mentioned how football coaches broke away from NCAA control. ""Maybe that’s what has to happen in women’s basketball?"" Auriemma said. ""Maybe women’s basketball has got to separate itself from the other women’s sports? But then that would be unfair because we would be leaving a lot of people behind that need our help."" Georgia Tech coach Nell Fortner, who  , asked about the use of the March Madness logos. Emmert told her he's been studying the branding but there currently is no legal or contractual restraints. Fortner said the use of ""March Madness"" and other branding was like ""eye candy"" that makes a viewer stop and watch on TV. Yet for the women's Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, only ""NCAA Women's Basketball"" was in the middle of the court. She also argued the women are a huge potential revenue stream with TV numbers backing that up. ""We're going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we really don’t step up to the plate at the NCAA as a whole to really water this sport, to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,"" Fortner said.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/emmert-promises-wbca-he-will-work-to-fix-stark-inequities
NFL veteran Colt McCoy linked to 'Eyes of Texas' alumni pressure on university to keep song,"Veteran NFL quarterback Colt McCoy was reportedly a part of an alumni-charged effort to persuade the   to keep its spirit song ""Eyes of Texas"" amid pushback over alleged racist ties. McCoy, along with former NFL player Jordan Shipley and several other powerful alumni, was a part of emails discussing the backlash against the song in June, the   reported, citing emails the publication obtained. McCoy was reportedly on a conference call with energy entrepreneur Bud Brigham and other alums to talk about the song and come up with other ideas to remedy the situation. Scott Ingraham, another Texas alumnus, told those on the email chain the group should contact school president Jay Hartzell and athletic director Chris Del Conte and steer them away from making an immediate decision, according to the Texas Tribune. Ingraham also suggested that the school create a task force to review the song. ""A diverse group to illuminate the history and also the value of the song for ALL the stakeholders would be a healthy and beneficial process, as opposed to what is happening now with demands, or else,"" Brigham reportedly wrote to Hartzell on June 29. According to the newspaper, Brigham also wrote that the former Longhorns quarterback might suggest a task force to Del Conte. The committee was formed and a determination was made, but University of Texas at Austin spokesman J.B. Bird told the newspaper that the committee wasn’t formed due to alumni suggestions. McCoy did not comment on the story and the extent of his influence was not clear. He recently signed a one-year deal with the  . Hartzell declined to comment. On Monday, the Texas NAACP, along with Black Texas elected officials, some civil rights leaders, and Texas students and alumni held a press conference to announce their fight for the school to stop using the song, according to  . Critics of the song have said the ""Eyes of Texas"" has Confederacy ties. A 58-page report on the song was released by the university in March. A 24-person panel that convened to determine the meaning behind the song’s roots, lyrics and history   and striving toward excellence. The title of the song was reportedly taken from a favored saying of a former school president who had mimicked remarks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and was performed by musicians in blackface at minstrel shows. However, the panel could not find a direct link to the line ""the eyes of Texas are upon you"" and Lee. While alumni expressed issues with players not standing and participating in the playing of the song, Hartzell said in March that no student-athlete would be mandated to do so. ""Nobody has been, or will be, required to sing the song,"" Hartzell said. ""That's going to be going forward the way we continue to operate. We hope that as people go through the report, read through the facts, they'll find ways to participate in some way. Whether it's the case of the athletes standíng on the field, or the fans in the stands as we sing, there's going to be no punishment, no mandate, no requirement if people choose not to participate.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-colt-mccoy-eyes-of-texas-alumni-pressure-song
"Some cars are cheaper than they used to be, Consumer Reports study finds","The average price paid for   and trucks in the U.S. has reached record levels, but that doesn’t necessarily mean cars have gotten more expensive. In some cases, they’re technically cheaper than they were decades ago,  . The organization took a look at the 1,900 cars it has purchased for testing over the past four decades and discovered that, when adjusted for inflation, the prices for most had dropped significantly or stayed the same. For example, in 1996 it bought a   Camry for $20,509.31 that would be $33,220.09 now, while the latest Toyota Camry Hybrid it purchased cost $29,000.

The report noted that the prices paid for trucks have gone up considerably, but that the vehicles are more retail-oriented and packed with more comfort and convenience features than in the past. The growth in high-end truck and luxury vehicle sales is largely behind the increase in average transaction prices that have made headlines and are now near $38,000, according to  .

"CBP projects 184,000 migrant children will cross border in fiscal year 2021","Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is projecting that as many as 184,000   could reach the border in the fiscal year 2021 -- the latest insight into the dramatic and continuing   facing the Biden administration. Two sources familiar with internal data confirmed the estimate to Fox News, with one agent saying: ""We’ve never seen anything like this before."" While only a projection, if accurate it would be the highest number of UACs on record, and more than twice the 76,020 encountered during the 2019 border crisis -- during which the Trump administration was hammered for its handling of the crisis and detention of children.  The Biden administration has declined to call the surge in numbers -- set to eclipse the 2019 crisis on multiple metrics -- a ""crisis,"" describing it instead as a ""challenge"" and blaming the numbers on deteriorating conditions in Central America and the overwhelming situation at the border on the Trump   of legal asylum pathways. There are currently nearly 5,000 children in Border Patrol custody and more than 13,000 in Health and Human Services custody. CBP, meanwhile, encountered more than 100,000 migrants in February, and that number is expected to have risen in March. President Biden has also downplayed the number of migrants coming to the border. ""The truth of the matter is nothing has changed,"" he said at a recent press conference. ""It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year."" Republicans have insisted that it is a crisis, and blamed it on the rolling back by Biden of Trump-era border protections such as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which kept migrants in Mexico while they awaited their hearings, and asylum cooperative agreements signed with Northern Triangle countries. His administration has also limited Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) priorities and halted construction of the border wall. There has been increased scrutiny of the administration’s handling of child migrants in recent days as both Republicans and journalists toured the facility in Donna, Texas, which is at 1700 percent capacity and images showed migrants packed in tiny ""pods.""

Data from Realtor.com shows that sales of homes built more than 100 years ago rose by 16% in 2020 in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) compared to last year, with a median sale price of $236,000. During the same period, New York City saw a sales decline of 6% overall. ""The biggest ask right now is ‘something old with character’ — newer homes have none of the richness or the stories of something built in 1814,"" New York-based Compass agent Adam Carroll told The Post. Viral social media accounts like Elizabeth and Ethan Finkelstein’s   feed on Instagram — which spotlights dilapidated properties for sale for less than $100,000 and boasts 1.5 million followers — fanned the flames, galvanizing real estate markets in historic areas across the country. But while ""cheap old house"" buyers may see ""good bones"" when they pick up a stunning Queen Anne or a cool Craftsman bungalow, experts warn that restoring these money pits to their former glory requires serious know-how and a fat checking account. Four months ago, attorney Stephen Simcock, 58, found out firsthand. He purchased a 170-year-old waterfront fixer-upper in the Hudson Valley when the pandemic changed his work/life balance. He declined to reveal the exact cost of his new retreat, but he paid more than three times the area’s median listing price of $775,000, according to Realtor.com. ""I might have legal title, but I’m joining its story,"" said Simcock of the Greek Revival property in the hamlet of Barrytown, New York. A 4,200-square-foot former ice store, complete with the ghost foundations of demolished storage houses dotted across its 1½-acre grounds, the four-bedroom home boasts a torrid history. ""In its various iterations, this house has been a store, definitely a hotel, maybe a brothel, a halfway house, a college dorm and then a single-family house,"" he paused, laughing, ""I like to think I bring a little of all of that."" Simcock said he knew what he was getting into when he bought the house. For instance, he knew that he would add bathrooms, open up the kitchen and replace the small, heat-conserving windows, typical of their time, with large frames to maximize his water views. ""The goal is for it to become a really beautiful country house, having accreted so much charm over the years, but with more creature comforts,"" he said. All of those elements came with costly challenges. But it was the antique beadboard (vertically grooved wall panels) that caught him by surprise. The decorative wood molding, which runs down his stairway, had been stripped from most of the walls. Simply identifying the specific style of board has been a challenge; finding matching replacements has been a head-scratcher. Hunting down matches for rare newel posts and spindles (the decoratively turned supports on a staircase or railing) was also difficult. ""I’m a dilettante, but I’m doing it with as much rigor as I can."" Simcock said. ""I’m poring over books of architecture and design to find the perfect, perfectly authentic pieces.""",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//real-estate/homebuyers-old-houses-unaware-costs

"Jen Shah’s house—the infamous ‘Shah Ski Chalet’—is an alleged fraud, too",""" "" star  , was   for  . But her alleged victims weren’t the only ones getting faked out — so were Bravo fans. The 47-year-old breakout star quickly became notorious for her flamboyant fashions and her friendship faux pas — both equally loud — on Season 1 of the latest entry in the ""Real Housewives"" franchise. However, the $3.9 million Salt Lake City rental she grandly passed off as the ""SHAH SKI CHALET"" actually never belonged to Shah, The Post has learned.  Instead the 9,420-square-foot home featured on the show is owned by the Texas-based real-estate rental company, Univesco Inc., which is under the limited liability company RJW Capital Investors.  Yes, it was (GASP!) a rental: Property records discovered by The Post reveal Univesco Inc. has owned the home since 2014. And as any true fan knows, in the ""Real Housewives"" universe, few things are more shameful than renting your own home. After all,  once   those who choose to rent. ""I don’t understand the concept of renting at all,"" the ""Real Housewives"" executive producer, 52,   in 2019. ""It’s just throwing money away. Especially a huge home. I don’t get it."" Steven Frey of Univesco told The Post she had no idea that Shah had been hyping the property as her own on the show. A separate spokesperson handling their Utah properties exclusively is expected to provide more details at a later time. Bravo itself may have also been deceived, considering they did not shy away from promoting the chalet on the show, including a  (Reps for the network declined to comment to The Post, but insiders told The Post they were well aware of the rental status.) ""On the November 11 series premiere … Jen Shah hosted a lavish fete at her house, but even before she transformed the abode (which she calls the ""Shah Ski Chalet"") for her castmate Meredith Marks’ birthday, our jaws dropped over her insanely gorgeous home,"" the article gushed. Although it went largely unnoticed at the time, speculation that one of the housewives from the show was renting a property to film   and podcasts. But there was even gossip in the housewives’ inner circle: On a Feb. 12, 2020 episode of  hosted by ""Real Housewives of Dallas"" star Brandi Redmond and Stephanie Hollman, Redmond revealed that she knew someone from the ""RHOSLC"" was renting. ""I do know that one of those ladies is renting a house,"" ginger-maned Redmond teased ominously. ""I don’t know [who it is] because I don’t know the cast but I do know that one of them is a renter because they’re renting some friends of mine’s home."" Shah reacted in her signature over-the-top style to Redmond’s comments on Instagram — after a helpful fan page shared an audio clip of her comments. ""Is this what everyone is getting their g-string up their a** about bcuz [sic] their irrelevant? Or is it bcuz they wish they could afford to pay the rent plus own 4 other homes and have an apt in NYC?"" Shah wrote in the comment section of a now-deleted Instagram post at the time. In a later post she continued to wax poetic: ""You want to come for me with your red hair and bulls–t, come harder honey. You’re about to get a taste of SHAH SQUAD and I don’t mess around. PERIODT."" Note: The Post could find no documentation to substantiate Shah’s claims of owning four other properties and an apartment in NYC. However, the sprawling chalet home featured on Bravo was up for sale in 2019, until the five-bedroom, six-bathroom spread was taken off-market — apparently during the time Shah began filming for the show, according to documents. According to the listing, the timber frame home is equipped with ""three substantial master suites, each with its own fireplace and sitting area, and two additional bedroom suites."" However, off of reality TV, and in actual reality, Shah’s longtime home is located in Sandy, Utah, which she owned with her husband, Sharrieff Shah, from 2004 until she sold it at a loss in June 2020. They initially purchased the home for only $302,069. It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states. Her on-set debacle is a far cry from January, when Shah  , announcing she was launching a program dubbed ""Social Commerce,"" to assist women in need amid the  . ""We’re helping women pivot and shift their business through the quarantine and COVID,"" she explained at the time. ""To helping them still stabilize their business through online sales because their brick and mortar stores are closed… We’ve been working with some ladies, so you’ll see some of that coming out and hearing their stories and seeing how we help their businesses grow.""

YouTube star James Charles addresses allegations he sexted with teen boys,", known best as a personality on YouTube, has addressed allegations he was   in a recent video. The 21-year-old uploaded a new   on the platform Thursday taking full responsibility for flirting or sexting (sexually explicit texting) with minors. ""I was being reckless,"" he said, confirming that at least two interactions with minors took place. ""These conversations should have never happened.""  He explained how he added both minors on Snapchat and ""asked how old they were right away, was told that they were 18, believed them, engaged in flirty conversation and then, later on, found out that they were 16."" Charles said he's ""embarrassed"" and when the truth came out about their age, he ""blocked both people."" ""I needed to take accountability for my actions and more importantly apologize to the people that were affected by them,"" the Internet personality said.  In March, multiple minors came forward on social media and shared screenshots of their alleged conversations with Charles. Some claimed he asked them for nude photographs and/or sent them explicit photos and messages.  The beauty guru, who has over 25 million YouTube subscribers, admitted he believed the individuals were older. ""I trusted the information that was given to me rather than the information I could have and should have gotten myself,"" Charles said. ""As I did more research on this topic and self-reflected, I realized that the receipts and the screenshots and the specific details of the interaction don't matter, because I f---ed up and I need to take accountability for my actions and apologize to the people who were affected by them."" The makeup artist added how he's now understanding the unbalanced power dynamic between a celebrity and a fan. ""A power imbalance can happen even when it's not intentional,"" he reasoned. ""What I wasn't getting before is that the excitement that comes with talking to a celebrity is literally enough to make somebody do or say something they normally wouldn't. Even if that celebrity isn't even intentionally weaponizing their fame, money or power. That's a concept I just wasn't getting, but I now do.""  Charles concluded his video by announcing he's going to take a break from social media to ""further reflect and educate myself on these topics.""",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//entertainment/youtube-james-charles-addresses-allegations-sexted-teen-boys
NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei readies for April flight to International Space Station,"   Mark Vande Hei is set to lift off aboard the Soyuz MS-18   on an April 9 mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The flight engineer and Expeditions 64 and 65 crew member will launch that Friday from   Baikonur Cosmodrome alongside   cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov. Speaking with Fox News last week, the 54-year-old said his team had completed the final examinations for activities on both the   and the ISS. Vande Hei noted that   has had a ""big impact"" on the astronauts' training, from wearing masks around others to making sure the virus is not carried up to the space station.  ""We'll be in quarantine, we'll get monitored very frequently to make sure that we're staying  . And then, we'll have time to  , relax, walk around outside. I'm going to try to make sure I spend as much time outside as possible while I still have the chance. And, just make sure I have everything in order before we go,"" he said. ""In addition to that, we will also review a lot of the procedures that we'll be using to actually get to the space station. We'll do those pretty frequently."" Once the three have arrived at the space station, the veteran astronaut expects the first month to ""feel a lot different"" than his previous expedition in 2017.  ""I had a lot of adjusting to do, a lot of lessons to learn how to operate in an environment where the way I normally behave wouldn't work. I lost a lot of things in that first month [and] it was very frustrating and so many things that I could do without any conscious effort on the ground required me to concentrate completely,"" he explained. ""So, I'm hoping a lot of those lessons I learned will come right back to me and I'll be able to start sprinting this time."" Vande Hei has been with the agency since 2006, when he joined   Johnson Space Center as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center. , Vande Hei served as an ISS CAPCOM for Expeditions 15 to 20 and STS-122, 123, 124, 126 and 127.

Vande Hei told Fox News that he perceives his   aboard the ISS as being like a laboratory technician and that it's ""interesting work."" ""There are scientists that put a lot of thought into what experiments they want to get done. They're doing the data gathering and the data analysis and writing papers. My job is to facilitate if those things work when it's up there,"" he said. ""I need to make sure that they have the resources they need. If something needs to be troubleshot, I'll help out with the troubleshooting,"" Vande Hei continued. ""Sometimes those scientists will be looking over our shoulder with a video camera and will actually be coaching us on what they want us to do to try to help make things work."" The applied physician pointed out that he himself is ""part of the science experiment"" when discussing NASA's upcoming   to the   and companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and   SpaceX testing commercial spaceflights.  ""So, when we are on the space station that's a capability that we need to maintain somehow. But, we also want to start having these new capabilities, like you mentioned, with the Artemis program,"" said Vande Hei. ""It's going to be really hard if we can't do both of those things, all of those things, if all of the burden of that falls on the  ."" ""So, having ways where we can facilitate this continued capability to put people in lower   orbit both to do science and to train for longer duration missions and to learn about how to have people survive on long-duration missions and function well ...the only way we're going to be able to do that is if we can have that be commercially successful,"" he added.

"Judge grants restraining order on Lil Nas X collaborated 'Satan Shoes,' puts end to planned giveaway","Apparently you can tell   something, at least when it comes to his ""Satan Shoes."" U.S. District Court Judge Eric Komitee granted   a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.  It is meant to stop American art collective MSCHF Product Studio from   ""Satan Shoes"" that use Nike Air Max 97 as a base, according to court documents obtained by  . The controversial   were a collaboration with the 21-year-old rapper, which MSCHF and Lil Nas X promoted on Monday, March 29, via  . MSCHF modified the shoes with prints that read ""1/666"" and ""Luke 10:18"" along with a gold pentagram and a liquid-swishing sole that reportedly contains a single drop of human blood. The company quickly sold out of the 666 pairs it made for $1,018 each. Nike filed a four-part complaint against MSCHF on Monday, including trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition, trademark dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. Lil Nas X is not named a defendant in the lawsuit, according to documents uploaded by  . In a statement sent to Fox News on Thursday, MSCHF asserted the Satan Shoes were created as an artistic commentary much like the holy water-filled Jesus Shoes it debuted in 2019. ""Over a year ago we released the Jesus Shoes. As a manifested speculative artwork Jesus Shoes conflates celebrity collab culture and brand worship with religious worship into a limited edition line of art objects,"" MSCHF’s statement reads. ""Last week’s release of the Satan Shoes, in collaboration with Lil Nas X, was no different. Satan Shoes started a conversation, while also living natively in its space. It is art created for people to observe, speculate on, purchase, and own. Heresy only exists in relation to doctrine: who is Nike to censor one but not the other?"" Lawyers for Nike reportedly argued that MSCHF’s Satan Shoes are damaging to the sneaker giants brand and have caused confusion among customers who believe it is an original Nike creation, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, a lawyer for MSCHF   on Wednesday that opposed Nike’s application for a temporary restraining order. The art collective argues that it made it clear the Satan Shoes were a collaboration with Lil Nas X and not with Nike, according to defense attorney Megan K. Kannigan. ""There is not imminent or immediate threat of irreparable harm related to the Satan Shoes,"" the letter reads before explaining, ""all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped."" The final shoe was being held for a giveaway but MSCHF is reportedly holding off due to the current litigation. MSCHF will not be producing additional Satan Shoes, the letter explains. Representatives for Lil Nas X and Nike did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. The release of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes coincide with Lil Nas X’s music video ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name),"" which debuted Friday and shows the rapper dancing with the devil and taking his crown. In an explanation video Lil Nas X provided to  , the young artist said ""Montero"" is partly about his attraction to a man and the dark temptations that are in Hollywood.

When   Trooper Joshua Morris was out in Wilmington last week, he didn’t hesitate to shoot some hoops with local kids who asked him to join some pickup basketball,   reports. One of the youngsters, Ra’kir Allen, acted as the cameraman, commentator and cheerleader for the officer, who played in uniform. ""YAY!"" Allen screamed with glee in a now-viral  , as Morris scored a shot. The nine-year-old hollered, laughed and followed the state trooper’s every move as he showed off his game at the park. ""Oh that's Curry, that’s Curry, that's Curry!"" Allen cheered as the officer made a jump shot, and the two shared a high-five. ""His charisma, his character...I just loved,"" Morris told   of the pure-hearted kid. ""That reeks through his pores. I loved it."" Because Allen kept comparing him to Steph Curry of the NBA, Morris was inspired to treat the boy to a new pair of basketball kicks from the Golden State Warriors player’s Under Armour line. The state trooper got in touch with the fourth grader's mom, Elveria Griffin, to coordinate the sweet surprise, which was also caught on camera. ""My video is going viral because of you, you know that right? You is the man, everybody is talking about how you is the man, the best hype man ever,"" Morris told Allen in the heartwarming video that hit Instagram on Sunday. ""So I wanted to gift you with something. Do you remember what you said when I hit the jump shot and turned around? Curry, right?"" ""Since you was my hype man, I’m going to be your hype man right now,"" Morris said, opening his patrol car and taking out the shoebox. ""A fresh pair of Curry’s!"" Allen’s jaw dropped, and the trooper laughed, directing him to look in the left shoe. ""Is Curry in there?"" the boy joked – and found $50 in cash. ""I appreciate you, man, for you being the best hype man ever,"" Morris said, and Allen gave him a hug.   ""Anytime you see me, it’s all love,"" Morris explained. ""I always got your back, no matter what."" ""When we play on the basketball together that’s a common ground you and I can meet on so we can build these relationships. That breaks that barrier, so we can be friends, so from here we grow, we build a relationship,"" he added. Griffin told WPVI it was ""beautiful"" to see her son’s reaction to the generous gesture from his new friend. Law enforcement should never be strangers in the communities they serve, Morris stressed. Now, he hopes the kicks remind Allen he’s made a forever friend. ""When he laces up those sneakers, he has somebody who believes in him. He has somebody who loves him. He has somebody that will be kind to him,"" he said.

TikTok user takes issue with luxury NYC skyscraper in viral videos: 'Worst building in the world',"Another day, another TikTok  A fast-talking teen is building a following the video platform for  , most notably voicing disdain for a dramatic skyscraper in New York City she’s christened the ""worst building in the world.""

FDA approves 2 rapid coronavirus tests to be sold over-the-counter for at-home use,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this week approved two rapid, over-the-counter   tests that will soon hit drugstore shelves for easy, at-home testing capabilities.  The FDA in a Wednesday   said it has approved Abbott’s BinaxNow and Quidel’s QuickVue tests that the public will soon be able to purchase without a doctor’s prescription. ""Screening testing, especially with the over-the-counter tests authorized today, is an important part of the country’s pandemic response—many schools, workplaces, communities, and other entities are setting up testing programs to quickly screen for COVID-19. With the FDA’s authorization of multiple tests, the public can be assured these tests have met our scientific standards for emergency use authorization. As we’ve said all along if it’s a good test, we’ll authorize it,"" said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement.  Both tests require the user to collect a sample via a nasal swab that is then inserted into a test strip. Results take between 10 and 20 minutes.  Abbott said its test would be priced in the ""single digits"" per test and should be available in ""coming weeks"" at pharmacies, supermarkets and other chains. The company can produce about 50 million tests per month. Quidel did not disclose pricing for its test. Both companies said they would sell their tests in two packs. Repeat testing is important to reduce the chances of false results. Both tests can be used by adults to test children 2 years and older. While the move by the FDA is expected to vastly expand the availability of cheap home tests that many experts have advocated since the early days of the outbreak, the announcement came as U.S. testing numbers continue to slide, even as the number of new coronavirus infections is rising again. Still, frequent self-testing is considered key to help reopen schools, universities and offices as vaccinations ramp up. Dr. Michael Mina of Harvard said the expanded testing options would be critical as new virus variants spread and researchers study how long protection from vaccines lasts. ""Vaccines are incredibly important but they are not the end-all, be-all to this pandemic,"" Mina said. ""We need other tools in our arsenal and the widespread availability and rapid scale-up of tests for people to use in the privacy of their homes is going to be an extraordinary gain."" Last month, the FDA eased its standards for reviewing rapid screening tests, after months of criticism from Mina and other experts that they were delaying the introduction of increased testing.",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//health/fda-approves-2-rapid-coronavirus-tests-over-the-counter-at-home-use
Tucker investigates: Do highly-processed and sugary foods cause tobacco-like addiction?,"In the latest episode of Fox Nation's "" ,"" host Tucker Carlson and food and health journalist Michael Moss discuss whether highly-processed and overly sugared foods affect free will in the way vices like alcohol and nicotine do. Carlson recounted an experience in a supermarket several years ago, soon after he had completely given up consuming alcoholic beverages. ""There's a physical compenent to this,"" he said. ""I'd never felt it until I quit drinking 20 years ago and I was walking through a grocery store ... and saw a display of donuts -- and I've never been a big donut eater -- and my mouth started watering involuntarily,"" he said. ""And, I thought: 'this is the weirdest thing that's ever happened.'"" Carlson added that with such popular confections, the human brain must then view the starch and sugar as a replacement for the same qualities it found in alcohol. ""I remember thinking that there's soething about this experience that's challenging my view of free will,"" he said. In response, Moss agreed, obliquely comparing Oreos with heroin: ""Where's the ability to say no? These products by design or intent deprive us of free will."" Carlson further explored the idea, noting that fast food and confections can seemingly make someone a ""slave of your own compulsion"" -- adding that the health detriments brought on by overconsumption of such foods seems to be a taboo subject; compared to how the public decried Big Tobacco in the 199'0s and prior. He noted that, despite the proverbial experts' recommendations for various coronavirus mitigation options, they never brought up how closely obesity is tied to death or grave illness from COVID. ""We spent a year talking about COVID -- I dont remember 10 robust public conversations about obseity in the last year,"" he said, adding that an estimated 78% of coronavirus cases resulting in intubation or death were of individuals with clinical obesity -- which he and Moss linked to such foods. ""We dont want to belive these friendly things are problematic for us,"" Moss replied. ",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//food-drink/tucker-investigates-do-highly-processed-or-sugary-foods-cause-tobacco-like-addiction

"Ultra-processed foods, drinks linked to higher colorectal cancer risk: study","A   high in ultra-processed   was linked to an increased risk of colorectal  , according to a study conducted in Spain. There was no increased risk for prostate cancer, but breast cancer patients who smoke, or used to smoke, saw a higher risk.  Scientists from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), and other institutes,  findings in the Clinical Nutrition journal. Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses. The questionnaire assessed how often participants consumed ultra-processed foods and drinks over a one-year period. The team then used the Nova classification system, which divides foods into four categories, from unprocessed foods to processed ingredients, and beyond to processed foods and ultra-processed foods and drinks. Examples of ultra-processed products would include ""sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods,"" a related   from ISGlobal notes. ""Ultra-processed foods — those that undergo the most processing — are industrial formulations with more than five ingredients which usually contain additional substances, such as sugar, fats, salt and additives,"" reads the release. The team ultimately found that a ""10% increment in the consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks was found to be associated with an 11% increase in the risk of developing colorectal cancer."" Study author and ISGlobal researcher Dora Romaguera said diets low in fruits and vegetables are missing out on protective benefits against colorectal cancer and suggested the heightened cancer risk is fueled by ""additives and other substances with carcinogenic potential typically used in processed food products."" Common ultra-processed foods consumed by participants included sugary drinks, sugary products, ready meals and processed meats. For breast cancer patients with a history of smoking, or who currently smoke, Romaguera says smoking and a diet high in ultra-processed foods compound to increase the risk of developing cancer. Given the health risks associated with these sugary, processed foods and drinks, Pilar Amiano, a researcher at the Guipúzcoa Public Health Service, said the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( ) should already incorporate the findings into policies and dissuade consumption of these foods.",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//health/ultra-processed-foods-drinks-linked-higher-colorectal-cancer-risk-study

NFL legend Ray Lewis tackling new challenge – the Professional Fighters League,":   legend Ray Lewis is taking his skills off the field and into the cage. The Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker, 12-time Pro Bowler and two-time Super Bowl champion is teaming up with the Professional Fighters League (PFL) in a new role aimed at advancing the sport of mixed martial arts (MMA). ""There’s not a lot of options – only 1% make it in the National Football League, the NBA and so on – but when you have these people with these types of skills, I have an eye for that. I have an eye for people who have the will but don’t have the opportunity, people who have the skills but not the right platform,"" Lewis told Fox News in a recent interview. ""So, from a leadership side, it’s like me coming in giving all the motivation I’ve been given for years and empowering people to succeed."" Lewis joins MMA legend Randy Couture as the second member of the Athlete Advisory Board, which will be comprised of MMA champions, sports icons and experts in the medical field. Additional announcements are expected in the coming months. ""Ray is a champion, a true athlete and leader. Ray started his athletic journey as a wrestler, and MMA inspires him and so it’s a great fit,"" Peter Murray, PFL CEO said. ""He’s so passionate about the sport of MMA, its growth and ultimately the PFL’s vision."" As a member of the advisory board, Lewis, who spent his entire 17-year NFL career with the   and was one of the league’s top defensive players of all-time, will identify new talent and help drive the fighter-first culture of the PFL. ""Every day you have to have an edge, every day you have to be motivating yourself in life to lead. If you can get more people in these sports, as opposed to doing other things, then we win,"" Lewis said. ""That’s where I think me working with Randy Couture will be really exciting because it's combining our skills and life experiences."" Since its debut in 2018, the PFL has been a rising star on the MMA stage. Unlike the UFC, which features a handful of fights during each event, including preliminary bouts, the main card and a marquee fight usually for a title – the PFL operates much more like an NFL season would. ""It's a format built on meritocracy that works for every major athlete from the NFL to the NBA,"" Murray said. ""Fighters win to advance, those who lose go home. There is a regular season, a playoff and a championship."" The playoff-style format and the chance for the best athletes to advance and earn the million-dollar championship prize are what really drew Lewis to the PFL. ""The format is way better than what the MMA gives us right now. I just love that you have this real avenue to be successful – they want the same thing any NFL player wants. They want chances to be noticed, to go against top people in the business and make some good money,"" Lewis said. In just a few years since its first season, the PFL has already 25% of the audience of the UFC, according to  . ""What’s driving that success is a couple of factors – there's an underserved fan base of 550 million fans around the world, 80% of those fans are outside the U.S., 20% in the U.S.,"" Murray said. ""It is the youngest fan base of all major sports and half of this overall fan base they're not watching stick and ball sports, they want access to more premium quality MMA and the PFL delivers that."" Murray added that the PFL format provides another layer of success, being easy to follow with great narratives and big stars. ""With our sports season format, it’s actually complimentary to the UFC. It is distributed on ESPN on a different night of the week for those avid MMA fans as well as the casual fans,"" Murray added.    is still the heavy hitter, being valued at $7 billion, according to president Dana White, and highlights some of the biggest names in the sport like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. But with new sponsorships lined up, initiatives to expand its global reach, and new stars like Anthony Pettis and Kayla Harrison, the PFL is excited about its future. ""From Anheuser-Busch InBev, Geico to the armed forces are our current sponsors and we’ve partnered with IBM and many other major brands,"" Murray said, adding that there will be some major announcements ahead of the 2021 season from ""brands in some of the top spending categories in sports who have never sponsored MMA properties or events before.""

UFC's Francis Ngannou wants Jon Jones next: 'I am ready',"After his impressive knockout victory over Stipe Miocic in the second round of   260, Francis Ngannou was crowned the new heavyweight champion on Saturday night in Las Vegas. What’s next for Ngannou? A possible date in the octagon with UFC great Jon Jones. Ngannou, who is on a five-fight winning streak, addressed what could be one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport during his post-fight press conference. He said that it ""makes the most sense for me."" ""In my opinion, Jon Jones is the greatest of all time in mixed martial arts,"" Ngannou said via  . ""Him moving up is going to be a challenge I will take. It'll be a very good challenge. ... But this time I am the champ, he is coming up and looking for me. I am ready any time soon."" Jones, who last fought in February of 2020, will need to make his debut as a heavyweight in order to fight Ngannou, after spending all of his career in the light heavyweight division. After Ngannou pulled out the incredible knockout win over Miocic, Jones took his thoughts to Twitter, addressing the rumors that he may meet ""The Predator"" in the octagon next. Jones initially tweeted, ""Let's play baby"" after the fight. But he immediately deleted it and replaced it by saying, ""Show me the money."" After UFC president Dana White said Derrick Lewis would be a possible contender to face Ngannou next, he added that the ball is in Jones’ court if he wants to fight him. White said earlier this year that Jones will take on the winner of the Miocic-Ngannou fight. ""If I'm Jon Jones and I'm home watching this fight, I start thinking of moving to [middleweight],"" White said when hearing of Jones' tweet. ""What's 'show me the money' mean? You can say you want to fight somebody – but do you really want to?"" Jones fired back at White on Twitter after hearing what he had to say. ""I quit the light heavyweight division, literally gained a massive amount of weight. And now people are saying I'm afraid?"" Jones tweeted. ""Everyone but me claiming that I'm afraid. All I asked was to get paid."" Jones continued his rant on Twitter into early Sunday morning.

Francis Ngannou becomes new UFC heavyweight champ after Stipe Miocic knockout,"Francis Ngannou knocked out Stipe Miocic in the second round of   to become the new heavyweight championship on Saturday night in Las Vegas. Ngannou landed a couple of nasty punches early in the second round and appeared to corner Miocic against the cage. Miocic got back up and hit Ngannou and thought he had the advantage in the moment but opened himself up for more damage from the Cameroon native. Ngannou landed a nasty hook and caught Miocic by surprise and stayed on top of him for the win. It was a complete 180 from their first match at UFC 220 in 2018 when the fight went the full five rounds.

American Airlines offering 'quarantine free' travel between NYC and Italy," is offering   travel"" on certain flights from New York City to Italy in a bid to boost international travel and recoup revenue lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Soon, passengers who test negative for the virus will be able to travel from flights marketed and operated by American Airlines from New York City's John F. Kennedy airport to Milan and Rome without having to quarantine, the airline announced Thursday.  The major U.S. carrier fell short of specifying when this will occur but indicated it would be within the ""coming days and weeks.""  Prior to travel, customers will still need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Upon arriving in Italy, passengers will have to test negative again. The double testing will effectively allow those to ""forgo the local post-travel quarantine requirements, enabling customers to maximize their time while in Italy,"" the carrier said.  American plans to resume service to Milan starting April 4 and limited service to Rome on May 8 after being suspended for a year. After the onset of the pandemic prompted worldwide lockdowns, air travel was forced to a near standstill.  Industry officials say it was a ""catastrophe"" for the once-lucrative industry and ""there is no other way to describe it."" ""What recovery there was over the Northern hemisphere summer season stalled in autumn and the situation turned dramatically worse over the year-end holiday season, as more severe travel restrictions were imposed in the face of new outbreaks and new strains of COVID-19,"" International Air Transport Association CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in February. Global passenger traffic demand in 2020 fell by 65.9% compared to the full year of 2019, which the IATA says is ""by far the sharpest traffic decline in aviation history."" However, now that vaccines are being rolled out, the airline industry hopes to see the lifting of broad restrictions on travel between the United States and Europe, China and other regions that former President Donald Trump imposed last spring to curb the spread of the virus.  Meanwhile, U.S. air travel is already picking up. The number of passengers screened at U.S. airports has surpassed 1 million for 19 days in a row as of Monday, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  . This marks the most prolonged   rebound amid the pandemic.  To help, American has also upped its in-person pre-flight testing options for travelers across the country including at the airline’s hubs in Charlotte, North Carolina and New York City.  Customers now have access to testing at more than 150 local urgent care facilities or hospitals through GoHealth Urgent Care, the airline said. ",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//travel/american-airlines-offering-quarantine-free-travel-between-ny-and-italy
Matthews scores 24th goal as Leafs earn 3-1 win over Jets,"Auston Matthews scored his league-leading 24th goal and goaltender Jack Campbell stayed unbeaten this season and the   downed the   3-1 on Wednesday to extend their lead atop the North Division to three points. Adding to the Jets woes, captain Blake Wheeler did not play after the first period. There was no immediate word on a reason for his absence. ""We’ll get it looked at (Thursday). ... He just wasn’t feeling it right so we want to be careful with him,"" Jets coach Paul Maurice said. ""Truly I don’t know. He may be back on the ice full-on next game,"" he added. ""It’s not COVID-related."" The teams meet again Friday at Bell MTS Place as Toronto continues its four-game road trip. Zach Hyman and Alex Kerfoot also scored for Toronto. Mitch Marner, with two assists, earned his13th multi-point game of the season. ""I don’t know what the numbers are, but I’d imagine if you go up 2-0 in a game you’re going to win most of the time. It’s hard to come back in this league, especially that early,"" Kerfoot said. ""It’s nice to have that cushion."" Josh Morrissey scored for the Jets. The Leafs went 0-for-5 on the power play, extending a drought that goes back to March 9. But they did score short-handed. Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe opted to pass on the power-play deficiencies, choosing instead to see the positives. ""It’s a big road win here for us. There’s a lot of things you could pick out about it that we could do better,"" he said. ""We’ll certainly get to work on that (Thursday). But just focus on the fact that we had a really good start here to set us up for a chance to win the game and we did exactly that."" Winnipeg, back home after a seven-game road trip, had won four of its previous five, including a 5-1 win Monday in Calgary. But it trailed 2-0 after a sluggish first period that saw Toronto dominate despite going 0-for-3 on the power play. ""I was worried about this one right from the day the schedule came out,"" Maurice said. The Leafs were coming off a 3-2 overtime loss to visiting Edmonton on Monday. Toronto had won its previous three outings, including two in overtime, rebounding from a poor stretch that saw it lose six of seven. With No. 1 goalie Frederik Andersen back in Toronto awaiting further injury evaluation of a lower-body injury, Campbell started for the fourth time in the past five games. Campbell, who missed the Edmonton game Monday with a lower-body injury, made 26 saves for the win. He improved to 7-0-0 on the season. It was career game No. 299 as a Jet for goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who stopped 23 shots. Only Ondrej Pavelec (379) has played 300-plus games for the franchise. Matthews opened the scoring at 4:40 to punctuate a sharp Leafs opening. Hyman drove to the net and Winnipeg’s Pierre Luc-Dubois and Derek Forbort ran into each other, leaving Matthews to score from close range. Forbort, in pain after the collision, briefly went to the Jets dressing room. Matthews has scored the opening goal of the game six times this season. Marner, with an assist on Matthews’ goal, ran his points streak against the Jets to five games this season, the first Leaf to have a five-game point streak against Winnipeg. Hyman made it 2-0 at 10:47, poking the puck in from in-close after Matthews hit the post following a nice move by Marner as the Leafs top line swarmed the Winnipeg net. The Jets unsuccessfully challenged for goalie interference on Hyman. Toronto held a 13-2 edge in shots before Winnipeg closed the margin to 14-6 at the end of the first. Hyman had six shots alone in the period. The Jets had more life in the second, outshooting Toronto 16-7 in the period. But despite three straight Toronto penalties, they had to settle for exchanging goals with the Leafs. Paul Stastny appeared to lose a tooth after taking T.J. Brodie's stick to the mouth late in the period. Kerfoot scored short-handed on the ensuing double-minor penalty, outpacing Morrissey after the puck got out of the Toronto zone. Morrissey redeemed himself by scoring on the same power play, his shot beating Campbell through traffic at 17:15, with 6 seconds remaining in the first of Brodie’s two minors. Toronto played a controlled third period to preserve the win. NOTES: The Leafs were the last team in the North Division to visit Winnipeg this season. The teams split the first four meetings in Toronto. ... After playing 12 of 14 games on the road, the Jets play 10 of the next 15 at home starting Monday. The teams play again Friday night.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/matthews-scores-24th-goal-as-leafs-earn-3-1-win-over-jets
White Sox's Eloy Jimenez tribute on opening day raises eyebrows,"Eloy Jimenez was on the mind of   players as they took the field Thursday for their opening day game against the  . The odd tribute to the outfielder, who is set to miss about six months of the season due to a torn pectoral muscle, made it seem as though he had tragically passed away. He didn’t, fortunately, but fans took notice about Chicago keeping his jersey in the dugout and taking it out on the field with them. Jimenez injured himself last month in a spring training game. White Sox players acknowledged Jimenez being out leaves a hole in the lineup. ""It’s not like we think he can do stuff,""   told   on Wednesday. ""No, we know what he can do on the field."" Luis Robert, who has developed a friendship with Jimenez and will have a lot expected of him in 2021, told The Athletic that being around Jimenez helped him break out of his shell a bit. ""I’m a shy person, and just being around him and seeing the things he does has helped me to be more open and interact with more people,"" he said. ""He’s always happy and he’s always smiling, and that’s something that’s contagious. As a teammate, that’s something that gets you.""

The outfielder acknowledged he needed to do better in big moments. ""I let the team down twice there and even the ball over my head,"" he   in the 10th inning that allowed the game-winning run. ""That’s another opportunity we could’ve at least held them or at least caught that or cut the guy off to keep him from scoring. Lot of missed opportunities from my part."" Judge had been the focal point of concern throughout spring training. Anonymous scouts were concerned over Judge’s swing specifically. ""Judge goes to some hitting guru in the winter and to me his swing has gotten longer,"" one scout told   in March. ""He needs to go back and talk to Dave Winfield like he did in 2017 when he got to the big leagues."" Another scout added: ""That swing was really long. Judge has to get back to driving the ball into the right-center gap, which is when he’s going good."" Judge can still pack a big punch with the bat, which was proven with a long home run in spring training. But he’s not hit anywhere close to the 52 home runs he had during his rookie season in 2017.

Asian-American woman in Texas upset after Chick-fil-A wrote 'China' on her receipt,"An Asian-American woman in Texas is demanding answers from   after the   printed ""China"" on a recent receipt in lieu of her name, Tina. Last week, Tina ordered from the drive-thru of a Houston restaurant, telling   she annunciated her name while wearing a face mask. The customer claims an employee, with whom she spoke face-to-face, jotted down her name in the chain’s iPad ordering system, and that she scanned her Chick-fil-A app, which also lists her name, while placing the order. However, when she was handed the bill, she was shocked to find they wrote ""China"" instead. Tina added that she’s ordered from this Houston Chick-fil-A dozens of times before, too. Contacting the chain, she received the following response via email from the restaurant’s general manager the next day, per Business Insider: ""We want our customers to have a great experience, but it sounds like that didn't happen this time. We know we can't undo what happened, but we'd love another chance to get it right,"" the manager wrote. ""I spoke with my team members from that shift and they informed me that they misheard 'Tina' as 'China' and that it had nothing to do with your ethnicity."" Tina was reportedly offered a free meal as well, but claimed she didn't care ""about free stuff,"" and would have been satisfied if the restaurant pledged to ""offer more training and reassure that they'll do more."" A supervisor for Chick-fil-A reached out with another apology, claiming that they chain's ""young"" employees did not necessarily realize how hurtful their mistakes can be. Though Chick-fil-A did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News, a spokesperson told outlet that Tina’s name was misheard and that the drive-thru employee involved was sorry.

"Barzal has 3 goals, 2 assists as Islanders beat Capitals 8-4","Mathew Barzal had three goals and two assists, Jordan Eberle scored twice, and the   beat the   8-4 Thursday night. Brock Nelson, Casey Cizikas and Josh Bailey also scored to help the Islanders improve to 14-1-2 at home and move back into a tie with Washington and Pittsburgh atop the East Division with 50 points. The Capitals have a game in hand on both the Islanders and Penguins. ""These games are fun because you’ve got two intense teams,'' Islanders coach Barry Trotz said. ""Fortunately we were able to score some goals tonight."" Semyon Varlamov made 22 saves for New York, improving to 8-3-1 in his last 12 decisions while allowing only 30 goals over that span. Varlamov is 15-7-3 overall this season. John Carlson had two goals, and T.J. Oshie and Daniel Sprong also scored for the Capitals. ""I don’t think we played hard enough to win a hockey game tonight,'' Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said. ""Certain situational things I don't think we did a very good job on. We just lost a game and gave up eight goals. You look to fix that and be better tomorrow night."" The game featured a chaotic first period, beginning during the initial minute when Washington’s starting goaltender Ilya Samsonov had to leave the ice just 30 seconds in after Oshie collided with him behind the net. Oshie’s shoulder made contact with Samsonov’s head, and the goalie skated off for precautionary reasons. Vitek Vanacek temporarily took over in the crease. ""He had to go and get checked out. He was cleared,'' Laviolette added in reference to Samsonov returning to action. ""it was his game so he was going back in."" Carlson quickly opened the scoring at 1:01, blasting Washington’s first shot past Varlamov with assists credited to Tom Wilson and Conor Sheary. Eberle tied it at 5:02, taking a cross-ice pass from Leo Komarov and rifling the puck past Vanacek. The fleet Barzal then put the Islanders ahead 2-1 with a spectacular end-to-end rush, skating through the entire Capitals on-ice quintet and finishing off the solo effort at 16:09 with a high shot past Vanacek while somehow balancing on his right skate blade. ""I knew I had I had picked it up deep and had a little bit of a step,'' the 23-year-old Barzal said. ""I felt like I had some ice that I took advantage of."" Samsonov returned with just over three minutes remaining in the period, just before Nelson scored his 13th goal at 17:32 to make it 3-1. Sprong narrowed the deficit 48 seconds later before Barzal scored again at 18:53 by sliding the puck past Samsonov from a near-impossible angle below the left faceoff circle to make it 4-2 before the first intermission. The Islanders outshot the Capitals 13-7 in the six-goal first period and had a 9-7 shots advantage in the second when the scoring continued as Cizikas made it 5-2 with his seventh goal at 3:03 before Oshie closed the deficit with a power-play goal at 6:47. Eberle then added his second goal of the night at 8:08, one-timing a pass from Barzal for his 13th before Carlson added his second of the game and ninth of the season at 19:01 of the middle period. For the Islander squad that prides itself on winning tight low-scoring games, the rare romp was a relief. ""The importance of this game was huge after dropping two to Pittsburgh. We knew we needed to win,'' Eberle said. ""When you’re scoring, it makes the game fun ... It's nice to know we can put the puck in the net. All in all, it’s two points and that’s what we needed."" Bailey scored at 3:13 of third to make it 7-4 before Barzal completed his fourth career hat trick at 18:54, swatting a puck out of the air past Samsonov as the Islanders set a season high in goals. Barzal’s five-point performance gave him a team-best 33 points through 37 games. He is tied with Eberle and Nelson for the team lead with 13 goals. ""I think aside from my three, we were just playing good hockey all night'' Barzal added. ""I think we could have had two or three more."" The Capitals had won the first three meetings this season at home, outscoring the Islanders 12-6 in that trio of victories. The teams will meet three more times on Long Island and once in Washington. Washington had won 10 of last 12 games entering the contest with the only two defeats coming against the Rangers during that span. The Islanders were 11-4-0 in March, matching the 1981-82 Stanley Cup winning squad for the most wins in March. Since becoming the coach of the Islanders before the 2018-19 season, Trotz is 5-7-0 in the regular season against the team he led to the Stanley Cup in 2018.

""We’ve played a lot of hockey and pucks have not been going in as easily,’’ Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""It’s games like this when you’re battling back and down one with six (minutes) to go ... you just have to keep working to come out of these.’’ Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 36 saves to pick up the win. Eric Robinson and Zach Werenski scored for Columbus, which has one win in the past six games. Elvis Merzlikins finished with 31 saves for the Blue Jackets. ""I thought 99 percent of this hockey club played their (butts) off tonight,’’ Columbus coach John Tortorella said. ""I’m frustrated for the guys because I think they’ve really concentrated on how we’re trying to play right now. To get belief you need results and just to get nothing tonight ... it’s a tough one to eat.’’ Point scored the winner and his second of the game coming in on a 2-on-1 rush and as he tried to backhand a pass over to Tyler Johnson, the puck ramped off the stick of Columbus defenseman David Savard and into the net at 15:54. ""I felt like I had some jump tonight, I think our team had some jump and when we’re skating that’s when we’re creating chances,’’ Point said. ""When Columbus goes up they do a good job of shutting it down.’’ Colton tied the game 66 seconds earlier with a wrist shot from the middle of the left circle. ""I had passed up on a shot like that earlier in the game when I tried to cut to the middle,’’ Colton said. ""So that time I just wanted to get the puck on net and I was lucky that it went in."" The goal answered Robinson’s breakaway conversion at 10:54 that put Columbus in front for the first time in the game. ""It felt really good at the time,’’ Robinson said. Tampa Bay took the lead when Columbus was whistled for too many men on the ice while on the penalty kill to give the Lightning 62 seconds of a two-man advantage. Point cashed in with 15 seconds remaining on the 5-on-3 chance with a shot from the bottom of the left circle that powered its way through Merzlikins at 15:45. The Blue Jackets pushed back in the second period and found the equalizer as Werenski cut across the top of the crease to swat in a rebound off his backhand for the defenseman’s fifth of the season at 9:04 of the second period. ""We played good ... found a way to lose,’’ Werenski said. ""It’s tough right now. It’s one of those things where I thought it was one of our better hockey games and we find a way to lose again. Right now we need results.’’ Tampa Bay D Ryan McDonagh returned to the lineup after missing the previous four games with an undisclosed lower-body injury, but the Lightning remain thin on defense. Erik Cernak missed his fourth consecutive game since taking a puck off the inside of his knee on March 22 in Dallas while Jan Rutta was placed on injured reserve after leaving Tuesday’s game against Columbus with a lower-body injury. Tampa Bay called up D Ben Thomas from the Syracuse Crunch and assigned him to the taxi squad. While Columbus G Joonas Korpisalo returned to the lineup after missing three games with a lower body injury, he dressed as the backup to Elvis Merzlikins, who made his fourth consecutive start, his longest stretch this season.

Fiala's shootout goal gives Minnesota wild win in Vegas,"Kevin Fiala scored in the shootout and the   beat the   3-2 on Thursday night. The victory snapped Minnesota’s five-game road losing streak. ""We’ve been playing so well at home, it hasn’t translated on the road,"" said Wild goaltender Cam Talbot, who played his best road game of the season, stopping 35 shots. ""Every game is a four-point game this year. Every game is a big game, and when you come into a building like this, you know you’re going to have to go through this team to make it out of our division for the playoffs. This is a tough building to play in and this gives us confidence moving forward."" Talbot, who is a perfect 7-0-0 at home and improved to 3-5-2 away from St. Paul, is now 6-1-1 with a 1.72 goals-against average and a .948 save percentage in his last eight starts. He leads NHL goalies in saves and shots against, and is tied for second in wins since March 1. Kirill Kaprizov and Jared Spurgeon scored for Minnesota. Fiala was the only skater to score in the shootout, as he banked his shot off the post and then off Vegas goaltender Robin Lehner. ""He’s a big goalie so I didn’t know what to do to be honest,"" Fiala said. ""I decided to go low block and got lucky there. Hit the post and off his pad and in. It was lucky but I’ll take it."" William Karlsson and Brayden McNabb scored for the Golden Knights. Lehner had 35 saves but dropped to 3-0-1 with just six goals allowed since his return from a concussion. Vegas couldn’t capitalize early in the overtime during a 4-on-3 power play opportunity, as Talbot turned away three shots on goal. The Wild nearly got a last-second overtime win but Kaprizov’s wrap-around was denied by Lehner. Playing with just 10 forwards on the second of back-to-back nights, missing injured Ryan Reaves and suspended Chandler Stephenson, Vegas appeared to have a little more jump off the opening puck drop than it did one night earlier in a loss to the Los Angeles Kings. It marked the first time Vegas lost consecutive home games since early last season, when it lost three in regulation from Jan. 7-11, 2020, under then-coach Gerard Gallant, and a fourth in overtime, on Feb. 8, after Peter DeBoer took over. ""I thought we handled it well, I thought it was a non-issue,"" DeBoer said of playing with a shortened roster. ""Guys are always looking for a few more minutes every night. It was nice not to have that as an issue. I thought we had a great effort. Just unfortunate we didn’t get the two points."" The one point Vegas did earn moved it into a first-place tie with Colorado, as both are atop the West with 50 points. Karlsson opened the scoring when he grabbed a loose puck and fired it over Talbot’s right shoulder, marking the first time in four games the Golden Knights scored the game’s first goal. It didn’t take long for the top-scoring rookie in the NHL to tie the game, as Kaprizov was able to get position in front of the net in time to redirect Jordan Greenway’s shot past Lehner. It was the Russian forward’s 13th goal of the season. The second period turned into a highlight reel for both goaltenders. Talbot stopped rookie Keegan Kolesar, who had a beautiful look at the top shelf but had his wrist shot robbed. Just seconds later, after a faceoff to his right, Talbot blocked Kolesar’s backhand from the doorstep. Shortly after Lehner turned away Joel Eriksson Ek’s wrist shot from the slot, it was Talbot once again, this time stopping speedy Alex Tuch on a breakaway. McNabb snapped a 66-game scoring drought when he took a pass from William Carrier and lasered a wrist shot from near the top of the right circle through traffic and past Talbot. It was McNabb’s first goal since Nov. 21, 2019, against the San Jose, when DeBoer was still in charge of the Sharks. Minnesota took advantage of a 4-on-3 situation when Spurgeon blasted a one-timer from the left circle to make it a 2-2 game. Minnesota forward Mats Zuccarello played in his 600th career game. Golden Knights defenseman Nic Hague had just six penalty minutes over his first 28 games. He’s been plagued in the sin bin the last four games, accumulating 14 penalty minutes, including four against the Wild. Stephenson served the first of a three-game suspension, handed down by the league’s player safety department for elbowing Los Angeles Kings defenseman Tobias Bjornfot on Wednesday. Stephenson will forfeit $71,120.70, all of which will go to the players' emergency assistance fund.

Passengers cruise through Italy's Easter festivities on MSC Grandiosa amid country's coronavirus lockdowns," may be in a strict   lockdown this Easter with travel restricted between regions and new quarantines imposed. But a few miles offshore, guests aboard the MSC Grandiosa   are shimmying to Latin music on deck and sipping cocktails by the pool. In one of the anomalies of   that have shuttered hotels and resorts around the world, the   this winter with seven-night cruises, a lonely flag-bearer of the global cruise industry. After cruise ships were early sources of highly publicized coronavirus outbreaks, the Grandiosa has tried to chart a course through the pandemic with strict anti-virus protocols approved by Italian authorities that seek to create a ""health bubble"" on board. Passengers and crew are tested before and during cruises. Mask mandates, temperature checks, contact-tracing wristbands and frequent cleaning of the ship are all designed to prevent outbreaks. Passengers from outside Italy must arrive with negative COVID-19 tests taken within 48 hours of their departures and only residents of Europe’s Schengen countries plus Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria are permitted to book under COVID-19 insurance policies. On Wednesday, the Grandiosa left the Italian port of Civitavecchia for its weeklong Easter cruise, with 2,000 of its 6,000-passenger capacity and stops planned in Naples and Valletta, Malta, before returning to its home port in Genoa. Passengers welcomed the semblance of normalcy brought on by the freedom to eat in a restaurant or sit poolside without a mask, even if the virus is still a present concern. ""After a year of restrictive measures, we thought we could take a break for a week and relax,"" said Stefania Battistoni, a 39-year-old teacher and single mother who overnight from Bolzano, in northern Italy, with her two sons and mother to board the cruise. The pandemic has plunged global cruise ship passenger numbers from a record 30 million in 2019 to more than 350,000 since July 2020, according to Cruise Lines International, the world’s largest cruise industry association representing 95% of ocean-going cruise capacity. Currently, fewer than 20 ships are operating globally, a small fraction of CLIA’s members’ fleets of 270 ships. The United States could be among the last cruise ship markets to reopen, possibly not until fall, and not until 2022 in Alaska. Two Royal Caribbean cruise lines that normally sail out of Miami opted instead to launch sailings in June from the Caribbean, where governments are eager to revive their tourism-based economies despite activist concerns about the health and environmental impact. On the MSC, extra cabins are set aside to isolate suspected virus cases. Because of the contact tracing wristbands, if a passenger tests positive, medical personnel can identify anyone with whom they were in contact. Once the situation is clear, anyone who is positive is transferred to the shore. According to an independent consulting firm, Bermello Ajamii & Partners, just 23 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on ships since the industry began its tentative relaunch last summer, for a passenger infection rate of 0.006%. But cruise industry critics say the risk isn’t worth it and add that cruise companies should have taken the pandemic timeout to address the industry’s long-standing environmental and labor problems. ""All large cruise ships burn huge volumes of the dirtiest, cheapest fuel available,"" said Jim Ace of environmental group Stand Earth, a member of the Global Cruise Activist Network. ""Cruise ship companies could have used the COVID shutdown to address their impacts on public health and the environment. Instead, they scrapped a few of their oldest ships and raised cash to stay alive."" On board, though, passengers are relishing the chance to enjoy activities that have been mostly closed in Italy and much of Europe for a year: a theater, restaurant dining, duty-free shopping and live music in bars. The rest of Italy is heading back into full lockdown over the Easter weekend, with shops closed and restaurants and bars open for takeout only to try to minimize holiday outbreaks. In addition, Italy’s government imposed a five-day quarantine on people entering from other EU countries in a bid to deter Easter getaways. ""Let’s say that after such a long time of restrictions and closures, this was a choice done for our mental health,"" said Federico Marzocchi, who joined the cruise with his wife and 10-year-old son Matteo. The European cruise industry is looking to expand the reopening this spring. Cruises are circulating on Spain’s Canary islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, including the company AIDA catering to German tourists. Costa Cruises, which with MSC is one of Europe’s largest cruise companies, will resume cruises on May 1, with seven-night Italy-only cruises. Costa plans to begin sailing in the western Mediterranean from mid-June. Britain is opening to cruise ships in May, with MSC and Viking launching cruises of the British Isles, among several companies offering at-sea ""staycation"" cruises aimed at capturing one of the most important cruise markets. The cruise industry is hoping Greece will open in mid-May, but the country hasn’t yet announced when it will reopen tourism. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a ""framework"" for resuming cruises in the U.S., but the industry says the health agency hasn’t spelled out the details that companies need to operate their ships. Once the CDC provides technical requirements, industry officials say it takes about 90 days to prepare a ship for sailing. The cruise companies complain that last fall’s CDC framework is outdated and should be scrapped. They say it was issued before vaccines were available and before the restart of cruises in Europe, which they say have safely carried thousands of passengers under new COVID-19 protocols. And they complain that cruising is the only part of the U.S. economy that remains shuttered by the pandemic. The Cruise Lines International Association trade group is lobbying for an early July start to U.S. cruising, noting that loyal cruise customers will just go to elsewhere. ""Cruisers love to cruise, and they will go where the ships are sailing,"" said Laziza Lambert, a spokeswoman for the trade group. Still, environmentalists pushing back against an earlier restart say the timeout imposed by COVID-19 provides a window to address the industry’s issues. ""Large cruise ships pollute our air, our water, and contribute to climate change. They are toxic to port communities. And they spread COVID. They exploit workers and put passengers at risk,″ said Jim Ace, a Washington state-based campaigner who is part of the Global Cruise Activist Network. ""Why should large cruise ships be allowed to return before they have addressed these concerns?""",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//lifestyle/italy-takes-the-easter-festivities-to-sea-amid-the-coronavirus-lockdown
"Bueckers, McDonald propel UConn and Arizona to Final Four","One is a freshman who stepped into the job of leading the most successful program in women’s basketball. The other is a senior who accepted the call to build one of the worst into one of this season’s best. Together, UConn’s Paige Bueckers and Arizona’s Aari McDonald are two of the most dynamic scorers in the country heading into their Friday night clash in the women’s NCAA Tournament Final Four. UConn won the River Walk region and rides into its 13th consecutive Final Four as Bueckers this week became the first freshman to win The Associated Press national player of the year award. The challenge for Bueckers this season was learning how to lead a program that had already produced some of the game’s greatest players — including Rebecca Lobo, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Breanna Stewart — in the Huskies' charge for a potential 12th national championship. Before the season began, UConn coach Geno Auriemma considered bringing her off the bench just to ease her into the role. Two weeks of watching Bueckers in practice tossed that idea ""out the window,"" he said. Bueckers led the Huskies (28-1) in scoring, assists and steals this season and scored 28 points in their 69-67 regional final win over Baylor. Auriemma this week called Bueckers ""dominant"" in ""the biggest games we played."" But she’s still a freshman playing in her first Final Four at a program where winning it all is the annual demand. UConn hasn’t made it to the championship game since 2016. ""She’s still a young kid who was playing against high school girls last year, so yeah, this is big. Nothing that I say is gonna change the bigness of it,"" Auriemma said. ""I’m sure there’s a part of her that, you know, is anxious, nervous, all the things that you would be if you were her in a game like this ... But somehow, someway, she finds what all great players do. She finds that thing that she has inside of her that very few people have, that allows to her to function in those big moments."" McDonald’s burden was to build a winner at a program stuck in a basketball desert. Coach Adia Barnes put that job on her as soon as McDonald transferred from Washington in 2017 when the Wildcats were living at the bottom of the Pac-12. McDonald sat out the 2017-2018 season and watched at Arizona won just six games. Now she is the conference player of the year and has the Wildcats on level ground with the Huskies for at least one more day. ""It’s crazy. We really started at the bottom,"" McDonald said. ""Coach (Adia) Barnes and the other coaches. They do a great job recruiting. They changed the culture since I’ve been here. My teammates have put in so much work and it’s exciting to see it all pay off."" The Wildcats (20-5) won the Mercado region as a No. 3 seed. McDonald has scored at least 31 points in each of the Wildcats previous two games. Against Indiana in the regional final, she twisted her left ankle with 2:35 left, but limped back on to put the exclamation on the win with a 3-point play. She said the ankle should be fine Friday night. ""Nobody thinks we can win. We’re the underdogs We’re going to play loose and free"" McDonald said. The UConn-Arizona winner advances to Sunday’s final against the winner of Friday’s other semifinal matchup between Stanford and South Carolina. Auriemma and Barnes met in the 1998 women's NCAA Tournament when Barnes the point guard led Arizona to the Sweet 16, in what had been the school’s deepest tourney run. UConn won 74-57, but Auriemma remembers Barnes, who was the conference player of the year that season, as an ""impossible matchup."" ""You couldn’t guard her with a guard, you couldn’t guard her with a forward,"" Auriemma said. ""(Now) she has made women’s basketball at Arizona supremely important. She’s just, I think, a coach for the future who’s having tremendous success in the present."" UConn’s Christyn Williams has the difficult job of defending McDonald, who uses the quick bursts in her 5-foot-6 frame to blow by defenders on drives into the lane or sneak through traffic for wide-open 3-pointers. McDonald made five of six from long range against Indiana. She also grabbed 11 rebounds. ""She’s a great player, very quick, she can get to the basket, she can create space for herself,"" Williams said. ""She’s a handful."" Williams drew a similar assignment in the Sweet 16 and was able to contain Iowa’s Caitlin Clark, the nation’s leading scorer, holding her to 21 points, six below her average. Arizona is the first women's team to make the Final Four after missing the previous 10 NCAA Tournaments. They likely would have made the tournament last season but it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Barnes is the sixth coach to lead their alma mater to the Final Four. She also joins South Carolina’s Dawn Staley in the first time two Black women head coaches have made to the national semifinals.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/bueckers-mcdonald-propel-uconn-and-arizona-to-final-four
Tar Heels turn attention to hiring Williams' successor," now faces the challenge of finding Roy Williams’ successor. The Hall of Fame coach is retiring from the Tar Heels’ storied men’s basketball program, opening the job for the first time in nearly two decades. That leaves athletics director Bubba Cunningham directing the highest-profile coaching search of his nearly decade-long tenure at UNC, with Williams set to have at least some input. ""I believe we’ve got the best job in college basketball,"" Cunningham said. ""This job doesn’t come open very often. We need to spend a great deal of time thinking about who is the right person right now."" Williams  , saying he no longer felt like ""the right man"" for the job over the past two difficult seasons. That ends an 18-season run that included three NCAA titles since he returned to his alma mater after a 15-year run at Kansas. In a virtual news conference Thursday night, Cunningham said he and chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz would handle the process instead of using a search firm or committee. He said he has sought input from a numerous former players as well as Williams, who Cunningham said had already shared his opinion. Williams mentioned that, too, during his news conference earlier Thursday. ""I’m putting a lot of load on he and the chancellor’s shoulders because I’m giving my opinion very strongly about what I want to happen with the program,"" Williams said. Cunningham said he prefers head-coaching experience but it isn't required. The same is true of hiring someone with UNC ties, which worked with longtime assistant Bill Guthridge taking over after Dean Smith's 1997 retirement and Williams’ return in 2003 – but didn’t work during the tumultuous tenure of Matt Doherty after Williams turned turned down the job following Guthridge's retirement in 2000. ""The history and tradition here is winning,"" Cunningham said. ""We’ve had it in the family for a long period of time. That is important. But it’s not the only factor in trying to make a decision like this."" Cunningham said there is no specific timetable, though he noted UNC moved quickly in hiring Mack Brown for a second stint as football coach after firing Larry Fedora in a process taking only a few days in November 2018. He mentioned an urgency for a new coach to deal with large numbers of college players pursuing transfers, a list that includes UNC freshman 7-footer Walker Kessler. ""It’s going to be a very different environment in coaching, recruiting and retaining students to play on the team,"" Cunningham said. ""And quite frankly, college basketball is better when North Carolina is good. We need to be good and we’re committed to being good. And now we have to find the right leader that can maintain the standards that we’ve become accustomed to.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/tar-heels-turn-attention-to-hiring-williams-successor
Nuggets lead all the way in beating Clippers 101-94,"Jamal Murray scored 23 points and the   led all the way in beating the   101-94 on Thursday night for their fourth straight victory. The Nuggets dominated the first three quarters on a night when Nikola Jokic didn’t reach double figures until hitting a 3-pointer with 5:20 left in the game. He finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. ""We expect 30, 20 and 15 from him every night,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said of Jokic. ""He didn’t play poor but he didn’t play to the level he’s played at in the last 15 games."" Jokic’s supporting cast came through. Michael Porter Jr. added 20 points and Will Barton had 19 points. Aaron Gordon added 14 points as Denver improved to 3-0 since Gordon arrived last week via a trade from Orlando. ""We set the tone and were able to sustain that,"" Murray said. ""We were in control and especially on the road that’s a big deal."" Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 24 points and 12 rebounds. Paul George had 17 points and eight rebounds in his return after missing two games with a sore right foot. Terance Mann added 18 points off the bench. George said the soreness and swelling in his foot is related to the bone edema issue that sidelined him earlier. ""It’s a day-to-day process, but I’m doing better,"" he said. ""Some days it’s more sore than others."" The Clippers made a run in the fourth, opening with a 13-3 spurt that left them trailing 84-83. But Denver outscored them the rest of the way. Jokic’s 3-pointer extended the Nuggets’ lead to six and Murray’s 3 made it 96-88. ""That’s back-to-back games that we’ve led wire-to-wire which is really impressive when you consider who we played, with Philadelphia being a very good team, as are the Clippers,"" Malone said. The Clippers, who lead the NBA in 3-point shooting, were 10 of 34 from long-range. Leonard scored 11 points in the third, when the Clippers trailed by 18 early on. He set up a dunk by Patrick Patterson and a 3-pointer from Mann before Leonard hit just his second 3 of the game. They trailed 81-70 heading into the fourth. Jokic was the only Denver starter not in double figures by halftime. He had four points on 2-of-7 shooting, five rebounds and four assists. The Clippers were out of sorts from the start. They were just 6 of 17 from the floor in the first quarter when Denver led by 13. Their foibles continued in the second. George was out on the break and missed an easy dunk. Nicolas Batum came in to clean up and also missed. Nuggets: Gordon had 13 and six points in his first two games. ... They dished out 28 assists, the 14th straight game they’ve had 25 or more. Clippers: They held Denver to 39 points in the second half after giving up 62 in the first half. ... They got outscored 42-40 in the paint. ... The ball got stuck behind the backboard in the fourth and Batum’s height came in handy in getting it dislodged. Newly acquired Rajon Rondo is injured, but he’s still contributing to the Clippers from the sideline acting as a coach.

"Players hear 'a lot of talk' from Emmert about Title IX, NIL","A trio of men's basketball players asked NCAA President Mark Emmert during a video call Thursday to abide by, and enforce, Title IX gender equity rules and to create a waiver that would let college athletes start earning money from use of their names, images and likenesses this year. What did the three students say they heard in return? ""A lot of talk,"" according to Iowa’s Jordan Bohannon. Another player involved, Rutgers’ Geo Baker, said Emmert repeatedly referred to waiting for Congress to intervene and summed up the session this way: ""What it really sounded like was that the NCAA doesn’t really want to be the first to make action."" ""We brought up a lot of our points, and it’s kind of like he would say the same thing and kind of agree with us. But that really wasn’t going anywhere,"" Michigan’s Isaiah Livers said. ""And obviously, from what I hear, he likes to kind of talk about points instead of make action."" Emmert's take: ""We had a really good, really constructive conversation,"" he said during an availability later Thursday, ""and I look forward to continuing to work with them and others."" In coordination with the National College Players Association, the athletes used a social media campaign — with the Twitter hashtag #NotNCAAProperty — during March Madness to protest rules that deny NIL rights and to put a spotlight on differences between the men's and women's basketball tournaments wrapping up this weekend in Indiana and Texas. ""Let this be the last NCAA tournament designed to treat women’s basketball players as inferior to men’s basketball players. Let this be the last NCAA tournament that generates a billion dollars from the talents of predominately black basketball players who aren’t allowed to make one dime off their own name,"" Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, said on a call with reporters after the three players spoke with Emmert and, in a separate video meeting, Sens. Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal. ""This is why we’re all here today — to call for an end to the economic, racial and sex-based discrimination NCAA sports imposes on college athletes,"" Huma said. Title IX says schools that receive federal funding must provide equal opportunities to men and women. But even if the trio that met with Emmert knows the rules do not specifically apply to NCAA action, they think its principles should be followed by the group that oversees college sports, especially in light of  . ""It wasn’t a mistake. It was almost like it was clearly done that they didn’t want to put as much effort (into) the women’s that they did for the men’s,"" Bohannon said. ""So us requesting that is further hopefully understanding in the future that this situation will never happen again."" In addition to the Title IX and NIL topics, Emmert was asked to give players more of a voice in the process, including in front of the Division I Council and Board of Governors. Huma said miscommunication led to there not being any female athletes present for the video meeting with Emmert, who said: ""We need to do the same thing with women’s athletes, by the way. Obviously, I haven’t talked to any athletes on the women’s side but want to do that as soon as possible."" There were women's basketball players who spoke to the media along with Bohannon, Baker and Livers. They said they were upset about the much-discussed differences between the two basketball tournaments. They also wanted to look forward and make the case for how NIL rights can help college athletes. ""I’m here just because I’m not sure that anything will change by the time I leave here,"" Michigan junior forward Naz Hillmon said, ""but I hope to see some change."" The blanket waiver would permit players to seek NIL endorsement deals as soon as July, before any full action comes on Capitol Hill, where there is legislation pending. And Emmert's response on that? ""Basically he said he’s going to get back to us. There wasn’t a direct answer. That was one of the times where he kept talking about Congress, you know? Needing help from Congress. What can Congress do first?"" Baker said. ""And then he basically said, ‘Well, if Congress doesn’t do anything, then we can discuss the other possibilities, like a blanket waiver.’ Kind of going around the question a little bit, basically just saying he’ll get back to us about it.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/players-hear-a-lot-of-talk-from-emmert-about-title-ix-nil
"Chargers playing family feud, not football, in fight over sale of NFL team","The   have had mixed success on the field since their return to the City of Angels in 2017, but now off the field, the team finds itself in the middle of a family feud with the future of team ownership at stake. Controlling owner Dean Spanos is facing a court challenge from his sister Dea Spanos-Berberian to force the sale of the team. Both are co-trustees of the Spanos Family Trust which controls 36% of the Chargers. The four children of late owner Alex Spanos -- Dean, Dea,  Alexandra Spanos Ruhl and Michael Spanos -- each own 15% of the team.  The family trust, which is reportedly in debt, cannot honor its commitments for its charitable contributions. So Spanos- Berberian contends the only way the trust can pay off that debt is by selling its share of the team. ""Dean refuses to consider a sale of the Trust’s Interest of the Chargers, insisting that the Co-Trustees continue to borrow more and more, and to force the charities and beneficiaries to wait for years and to ‘hope’ while Dean speculates further on a football team,"" Spanos-Berberian’s court filing said according to  . Spanos' sister argues that he ""has failed to present any plan to address the Trust’s bleak financial picture because there is no other plan ... His plan is hope."" According to Spanos-Berberian, the debts and expenses are over $353 million. Dean Spanos reportedly agreed to retain an investment bank at the end of the 2024 season to find a new owner for the team, but his sister contends that the debt is so high that the trust can’t wait any longer. After 56 seasons in San Diego, the team has a hard time finding its fan base in Los Angeles. The Chargers began in LA in the old AFL in 1960 and played their one season before moving south. With quarterback   as the face of the franchise for the near future, the Chargers are certainly an attractive team to purchase. The move to Los Angeles is another reason why someone like Jeff Bezos may be interested in buying the team. Forbes recently valued the Chargers at $2.6 billion. Spanos- Berberian says that the team is a ""rare trophy asset"" and says that ""the price a buyer is willing to pay is often not dictated by any economic metric."" Since the NFL recently agreed to a new media rights deal that could be worth more than $10 billion per year, Spanos- Berberian claims that the Chargers ""will certainly attract potential buyers.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/chargers-playing-family-feud-not-football-in-fight-over-sale-of-nfl-team
NFL considering changing onside kick and overtime rules,"The NFL is considering a rule change that would allow teams to maintain possession of the ball after a score by substituting one offensive play for an onside kickoff attempt. The proposal submitted by the Philadelphia Eagles is among 11 that will be voted on at the spring league meetings. This one would allow teams to keep the ball by converting a fourth-and-15 from their 25-yard line. Another proposal from the Baltimore Ravens changes the overtime format and eliminates overtime in the preseason. It allows the winner of the overtime coin toss to choose where to spot the ball for the first play or start on offense or defense from the designated spot. According to the proposal, ""regardless of which privilege is chosen by the winner of the toss, privilege (a) is to be exercised before privilege (b), so that the selection of whether to play offense or defense is made after the starting field position is chosen."" Other potential changes include adding a loss of down for a second forward pass from behind the line and for a pass thrown after the ball returns behind the line and to ensure the enforcement of all accepted penalties committed by either team during successive try attempts. A proposal by the Kansas City Chiefs would allow single-digit numbers to be worn by defensive backs, linebackers, running backs, fullbacks, tight ends, H-backs and wide receivers. Currently, quarterbacks, kickers and punters are the only players allowed to wear single digits.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-considering-changing-onside-kick-and-overtime-rules

Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert and Baylor’s Jared Butler each earned two votes. Garza ranked second nationally by averaging 24.1 points with 8.7 rebounds. He improved shooting percentages across the board – including going from 36% on 3-pointers last year to 44% – and his assist-to-turnover ratio after working on passing ahead of double- and triple-teams he knew would come all season long. Garza led the Hawkeyes to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, then accounted for nearly half their points (36 of 80) in a second-round upset loss to Oregon. The native of Washington, D.C., finished as the career scoring leader (2,306) at Iowa, which will retire his No. 55 jersey. ""We may never see another one like him,"" coach Fran McCaffery said. Sure, he had the big numbers and helped the Hawkeyes spend nearly the entire season in the top 10 nationally. But Garza figures the daily ritual of resetting his mind while focusing on something as simple as his breathing led to all of that — particularly in a season altered by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You had to be in your house quarantined, going to the gym, going home,"" Garza said. ""There’s no distraction. If you play a bad game, that’s all you’re thinking about. So you need to be in a healthy mental space or you would just let it eat at you – especially a person like me who thinks as much as I do. ""I needed it to be a daily thing because I faced this anxiety every single day. It definitely became something that helped me out a lot and contributed to my being able to be there and be in the moment every single game and every single day."" Garza was second to Dayton’s Obi Toppin for last year’s award. It was during that season that he began gameday meditation at the suggestion of his father, a former player at Idaho. As Frank Garza put it: ""It’s worth taking the mind to the gym."" ""Every player deals with that performance anxiety and overthinking, so he was not immune to it,"" the elder Garza said. ""But what happened as the stakes got higher, and the performance requirement was higher, the pressure becomes at the same level. And if you’re not dealing with it, that will consume you. That will eat you alive."" As a senior, Garza moved to daily meditation, typically 20 to 25 minutes via Zoom with his father and Frank’s business partner, GuruGanesha Khalsa. Pregame sessions sometimes included some teammates, and Luka also used the Calm meditation-and-sleep phone app. ""I got to a point where I was waking up and I did a meditation every single day throughout the season because it was a daily thing that I was dealing with,"" he said. ""I’d turn on the TV and my name was being talked about. I needed to be able to just focus on what I wanted to accomplish as a team."" Some of that bled into games, too, with Garza practicing breathing exercises before free throws or during timeouts. He's sticking with meditation, too, as he pursues an NBA career. He has all the proof he needs that it can work. ""There's a lot of things in life that you want to happen or want to go better than they are and everything like that,"" he said. ""So it's going to hit somebody at some point, and it's just a very useful tool for really anybody.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/iowas-luka-garza-named-ap-mens-college-player-of-the-year

ETSU players allege men's basketball coach's resignation was due to protest support; AD denies,"The   (ETSU) men’s basketball team was embroiled in controversy during the season when players knelt for the national anthem. The move sparked a fervent reaction that went all the way to the Tennessee Statehouse. Coach Jason Shay resigned earlier this week and players who were on his team have spoken out about his departure, alleging the university forced him out over the kneeling protest during the season. ""I personally feel like him resigning is crazy,"" Buccaneers guard Truth Harris told   on Thursday. ""It shows a lot of what is going on in this town, and in this country right now."" Another Buccaneers guard Jordan Coffin added: ""All this about us kneeling, and then Coach Shay supporting us through all of that. People should want a coach that stands behind the players through anything. For that to be a part of why he has to resign, then I don't want no part of that."" Shay was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall award, which is given to the top first-year Division I Basketball Coach but lost to UC Riverside’s Mike Magpayo. Shay said in a statement it was in the ""best interest"" of himself, the family and the program to resign. ""This past year has been extremely challenging for me in many different ways,"" he said. ""It is the right time for a new challenge and an opportunity to reset my personal and professional goals."" East Tennessee State athletic director Scott Carter denied Shay was forced to step down. ""I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the speculation that appears in the news and on social media. ETSU did not fire Coach Shay nor force Coach Shay to resign. As outlined in the terms of the separation agreement, in Coach Shay’s statement and in my previous statement, Coach Shay decided to resign,"" Carter said. Carter added that Shay will receiver $450,000 per the parties’ separation agreement, according to  . Shay supported the team’s national anthem protest during the season. In February, Tennessee Republicans put ETSU and other Tennessee schools on notice after the team knelt. ""The National Anthem is a symbol of pride for America,"" a letter to the schools read. ""It lifts our spirits toward the ideals upon which our great country was founded: that all are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" The senators added: ""During athletic competitions, our student athletes represent not only themselves, but also our universities and all the citizens of this state, many of whom view this form of protest as offensive and disrespectful to the very thing our National Anthem represents. While we recognize our student athletes may express their own views on a variety of issues in their personal time, we do not condone any form of protest that could be viewed as disrespectful to our nation or flag while they are representing our state universities. ""When they don the jersey of a Tennessee university, they step out of their personal roles and into the role of an ambassador for our state. We expect all those who walk onto the field of play representing our universities to also walk onto the field of play to show respect for our National Anthem."" The lawmakers urged school officials to implement rules against kneeling during the anthem.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/etsu-players-mens-basketball-coach-resignation-protest-support-ad-denies

""I've never been a part of a game where a team basically had the same shooting numbers on free throws and on threes,"" Brooks said. ""We were 6 for 19 from the line and 5 for 19 on threes. You've got to step up and make free throws."" The Pistons shot 49% percent in the first half and held the Wizards to 20% on 3-pointers to take a 63-44 halftime lead. Detroit also went 10 for 10 from the free-throw line while Washington missed all five of their attempts. ""We let a hungry player take shootaround shots all night,"" Brooks said.

Len missed two free throws midway through the third quarter, dropping Washington to 0 for 7 from the line before Lopez made one with 3:13 left in the period. Washington took fewer 3-pointers in the third quarter, missing all three attempts, and still trailed 87-68 at the quarter's end. Wizards: Bradley Beal (hip) missed his third straight game.

"At last, Oladipo finally gets his chance to play with Heat","Victor Oladipo got swept out of the first round of the playoffs last season by  , and when that series concluded he had no doubt the Heat would end up in the NBA Finals. He was right. And now, he’s got a chance to help them make this season’s playoff push. Oladipo has been an offseason Miami resident, and now, he’s finally an in-season one as well. He started in his Heat debut Thursday night, helping Miami get over the .500 mark with a 116-109 win over the Golden State Warriors. ""He’s a veteran guy, he’s played in good programs on good teams, so he knows how to fit in,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I think defensively, it’s extremely natural, the fit. And offensively, he gives us that downhill attack, another guy that can make plays, another guy that can put pressure on opposing defenses in the paint."" It’s a fit that has been a long time coming. Oladipo is close with Miami legend Dwayne Wade — Oladipo played at Indiana for Tom Crean, Wade’s coach at Marquette — and that’s just one of many hints that this pairing was inevitable. Oladipo trains in Miami, his name somehow always seems to get linked to the Heat in trade or free-agent talks, and above all else he sees himself as a fit for the Heat. The buzzword they use in Miami is ""culture."" Spoelstra often says it’s not for everybody. Oladipo has craved being a part of it. ""I come from high-cultural basketball: DeMatha Catholic High School, to Indiana University, and now being on the Heat,"" Oladipo said. ""It’s a culture. It’s a way of life and it’s playing for something bigger than yourself. It’s sacrifice, it’s winning at the ultimate level. That’s what I’m used to. That’s what I flourish in. ""I feel like being a part of this and walking around that locker room every day and seeing those championships, and walking around and seeing what winning looks like, it’s going to help me be a better player, be a better person, and help me help this team win at the highest level."" That, and he’s already had a taste of that culture from the workouts he used to share with Wade. The three-time NBA champion with the Heat thought nothing of sharing secrets and advice with Oladipo, who soaked up every word. Oladipo came to Miami at the trade deadline last week, the Heat adding him — a two-time All-Star, a 21-point-per-game scorer this season and someone only three years removed from All-NBA status — from Houston in exchange for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick swap in 2022. ""It gives them another presence defensively, gives them another scoring option,"" Golden State guard Stephen Curry said. ""It’s a good pickup for a good team. Obviously, they’re the defending Eastern Conference champs and they got better and I’m sure he’ll enjoy his time here playing with the guys he gets to play with."" Oladipo didn’t enjoy playing against them last year, when he and the Indiana Pacers endured that first-round sweep. But even then, he knew the potential. And now that he’s in Miami, he’s eager to see if another deep Heat postseason run can happen. ""I felt how they clicked, what they were doing out there, I felt it,"" Oladipo said. ""I felt something special there. So, to be a part of this group now, it’s truly a blessing.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/at-last-oladipo-finally-gets-his-chance-to-play-with-heat
"Biden uses ESPN to slam Georgia voting law, wants All-Star Game moved","Barack Obama went on ESPN to unveil his March Madness brackets. Donald Trump regularly attacked NFL players for their anthem protests. And now Joe Biden is taking a swing at it. In an interview on ESPN’s ""Sports Center,"" Biden made news by backing efforts to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta as a protest against Georgia’s new voting law. It’s striking that co-host Sage Steele chose to ask about the controversial law, which Biden described as ""Jim Crow on steroids."" In the past, ESPN has drawn flak for being too political and too liberal, particularly when it came to Trump. Former host Jemele Hill caused an uproar when she attacked the former president as a white supremacist. But there is an effort by the baseball players’ union to use the All-Star Game to punish Georgia, whose restrictions on voting and ID requirements for mail ballots were signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. So Steele may have had little choice but to raise a controversy in which politics and sports had already melded. While Trump, a onetime USFL team owner, was often at odds with pro athletes—some of whom refused to make the traditional White House visit when they won a championship—Biden is eager to side with the players. ""I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" he told the network. ""People look to them. They’re leaders."" There is some precedent, as the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of Charlotte in 2017 to protest a North Carolina law limiting anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. In setting up another question for the president, Steele noted that Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has repealed his state’s mask mandate. He asked about the decision by the Texas Rangers to allow its stadium to be filled to capacity for its home opener Monday—more than 40,000 people--although masks would be required except when eating. ""That’s a decision they made,"" said Biden. ""I think it’s a mistake. They should listen to Dr. Fauci and the scientists and the experts, but I think it’s not responsible."" Most baseball franchises are limiting attendance. In the latest sign that MLB isn’t any more immune from this virus this season than the last one, yesterday’s Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets was postponed after five people in the Nats organization tested positive for Covid. Trump made his attacks on pro football players into part of the culture wars. In one tweet four years ago, he pulled a page from ""The Apprentice"": ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!"" Another time, the 45th president wrote: ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired.’"" Trump also told Mike Pence to leave an Indianapolis Colts game if a number of players took a knee, which the vice president did. And Trump taunted the league when the ratings declined. Also in 2017, Trump withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors after Steph Curry and others criticized him. The team visited Obama instead. It’s hardly shocking that Biden, a self-proclaimed ""union guy,"" would back the baseball players’ union. The All-Star controversy was also a slow pitch over the plate for him, given his repeated denunciations of the Georgia voting law. But Biden is unlikely to insert himself into numerous sports controversies. Meanwhile, Georgia politicians are also taking a baseball bat to major corporations. After Delta’s CEO slammed the voting law as ""unacceptable,"" the state House passed a bill repealing the airline’s tax break on jet fuel.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-uses-espn-to-slam-georgia-voting-law-wants-all-star-game-moved
"22 states fight California gun restrictions, urge Ninth Circuit to rule against large-capacity magazine ban",": A coalition of 22 states, led by the Republican attorneys general of Arizona and Louisiana, is urging the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to   California’s controversial attempt to ban high-capacity magazines, after the court agreed to reconsider its decision to rule it unconstitutional. ""California politicians are at it again, convinced that their agendas should override the Constitutional rights of the people,"" said Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, in a statement, announcing the filing of an amicus brief. ""Attempts to undermine the Second Amendment or any of our civil rights and liberties should be met with deep skepticism and vigorous opposition."" California passed a ban on magazines of 10 bullets or more in 2016. A ruling by a federal judge that it was unconstitutional was upheld by a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit last year. In February, the court agreed to have an 11-judge panel rehear the case. ""Large-capacity magazines have been used in many horrific mass shootings around the country, including right here in California,"" said then-California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, in February. ""That’s why today’s decision by the Ninth Circuit to rehear this case is critical; it is the next step in the defense of our state’s commonsense gun laws."" The 22 states have filed an amicus brief in support of the pro-gun rights side, arguing that it violates Americans’   right to bear arms. They say it bans the possession of arms even for self-defense, since the magazines that are banned are integral to some of the most popular firearms. ""California is trying to turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals simply for owning the magazines that come standard to many of the most popular firearms in our country,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in a statement. ""As radical leftist lawmakers in California and beyond persist in their attempts to legislatively overrule our constitutional rights, I will continue to stand strong in defense of our right to keep and bear arms."" The 22 states with Republican state attorney generals signed onto the amicus brief include Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia. Oral arguments are scheduled to begin on the case in June. The states argue that the right to bear arms protects those in disadvantaged communities, and in high-crime areas where law enforcement may be unable to respond in time to crimes being committed. ""California should not be allowed to invade its own citizens’ constitutional rights, and this Court should not imperil the rights of citizens in this Circuit and other states with its analysis,"" the brief says. California has argued that such a ban is necessary since guns with more than 10 rounds have been used in a number of mass shootings. California banned the manufacturing, sale and transfer of such magazines in 2000. But in 2016 the state tried to ban even the possession of those magazines. But it was struck down after the lawsuit, which was launched by the National Rifle Association and a coalition of gun owners. The review comes as   to act on gun control measures -- including a ban of large-capacity magazines, after shootings in Boulder, Colo., and Atlanta Georgia.  Biden urged Congress to ban ""assault weapons"" as well as high-capacity magazines.  ""I got that done as a senator. It brought down mass shootings, we can do it again,"" Biden said during remarks at the White House. ""We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/22-states-ninth-circuit-californias-large-capacity-magazine-ban

The then-president elect was caught on camera in November telling the pair ""in my Oval Office, mi casa, you casa,"" when it appears he meant to say ""mi casa es su casa,"" which means my house is your house. The flub took place at an early meeting about combating the pandemic. As  , it was Jill Biden this week who mispronounced the phrase ¡Sí Se Puede!"" ‒ which translates to ""Yes we can"" in Spanish ‒ during a speech in Delano, California honoring the birthday of labor leader and civil rights icon César Chávez. The phrase was popularized by Chávez and his United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta, and was used as a motto by the group in the  . It has also been adopted by other activist groups. Jill Biden did, however, pronounce the phrase correctly elsewhere in her speech. Politicians have been encouraged to learn Spanish, which is the second most common language in the U.S. DuoLingo announced in February that it had partnered with Voto Latino to urge newly-elected officials to continue efforts to learn Spanish beyond the campaign trail. However, there are many instances of misunderstanding translations as politicians attempt to learn the language. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, found himself in hot water after he quoted revolutionary leader Che Guevara during his unsuccessful campaign for the presidency. He used the phrase ""hasta la victoria, siempre,"" which means ""until victory, always"" and is associated with Guevara. De Blasio was also criticized for attempting to nickname President Donald Trump  , which can translate to condom in Spanish.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/jill-joe-biden-spanish-mishaps
"Tucker Carlson: Biden's 'infrastructure plan' is not about infrastructure, but you'll still pay for it","If you watched   sputter through his announcement of   $2 trillion ""infrastructure plan,"" you may have been left with some questions. First, is this really about infrastructure? Bridges? Roads? Airports? Things we could actually use? Or is it yet another weird climate scheme/power grab/race-based redistribution plan? What exactly is this? And by the way, $2 trillion sounds like a lot for anything. Won’t that kind of spending cause hyperinflation? If you print money like it’s not worth anything, doesn’t the value of that money decline? Normal people may have had questions like that. Thankfully The   was on the scene to quell all doubt. The Times approached Biden’s plan with the calculated enthusiasm of   applauding yet another record Soviet potato harvest. ""Biden Plan Stresses Jobs, Roads, and Growth"" read one of the Times'   Thursday morning. ""$2 Trillion for 'Once in Generation' Fix of Infrastructure"" read another.  , the tech lobbyist-turned-White House chief of staff, was so grateful for the backup he tweeted out the front page himself. What does the future look like that Ron Klain wants to win? Well, let’s be clear from the outset that this plan will not make your commute easier. Only about 5% of that $2 trillion will actually go to roads and bridges. So, 5% on infrastructure, 95% on social engineering. That’s what Joe Biden calls a once-in-a-lifetime infrastructure bill. He’s right about part of it: It is once in a lifetime. If this passes, the next generation will life in a very different country. Before we tell you what’s in the bill, a word about who will pay for it. In fact, we only need one word: You. Taxes are going up dramatically. They didn’t have to, actually. Tax revenues no longer fund the ambition of our political class. The Federal Reserve does. When politicians want something, they just print the money. It’s called Modern Monetary Theory. They’ve been doing this for years, and it’s accelerating. There’s no actual reason to raise taxes anymore, for anything. But Joe Biden wants to, just to punish you. And he plans to do that. The administration is calling for a tax increase of about $3 trillion over ten years. That includes taxes on individual income and investments, as well as corporations. That would make this the first major tax hike in 28 years. But it's actually a much bigger tax increase than anything we saw under the Clinton administration. In 1993, taxes amounted to only around 0.5% of GDP. This plan would come to roughly three times that – about $300 billion a year, or 1.36% of GDP. You'd have to go back to 1968 to find a bigger tax increase. It’s a big deal. Have any questions? No questions allowed. Joe Biden doesn't want to answer questions. This is an emergency. And in emergencies, you do what you’re told. ""We can't afford not to spend $2 trillion,"" says Joe Biden, like the used car salesmen he is at heart. Biden knows he won’t be paying a dime. People like Joe Biden avoid taxes. Joe Biden himself avoids taxes, in fact. In 2017 and 2018, Joe Biden and his wife dodged payroll taxes on more than $13.3 million they earned through speaking fees and book royalties. How did they do that? The   reported that the Bidens ""classified the income as S-corporation profits rather than taxable wages."" Surprised? Come on. You also shouldn't believe a word about how corporations are going to pay for this. We’d support it if that was the case. But they’re not. Corporate interests put Biden in the White House. They designed his policy, they sign off on every part of it, just like the credit card companies in Delaware once did. They’ll be fine. Corporations shelter most of their money from taxes by passing the costs along to workers (in the form of lower wages) and customers (in the form of higher prices). That's not a secret. Economists know that, and so does Joe Biden. None of this will hurt Amazon, that’s why Amazon is for it. Joe Biden isn’t interesting in getting into those details, like the math. He’d like you to know that this bill is going to turn America into a scene from ""The Jetsons."" Flying cars? Teleport machines? Sadly not. We're going to ""modernize those highways."" Quite honestly, a lot of them could use it. But what does modernizing highways mean exactly?  A piece in The   gives us some idea. According to the Post, an activist by the name of Amy Stelly has been demanding the removal -- not the building, the removal -- of a highway that cuts through her neighborhood in the city of New Orleans. She thinks the highway, known as the Claiborne Expressway, is bad. It’s an eyesore and contributes to pollution. For years, she's demanded local leaders get rid of it. But they refused. People use it. It’s an important stretch of road. But now the White House, and Joe Biden's infrastructure plan, have decided that highway is an example of ""historic inequity"" that can be solved by ""billions in new spending."" In other words, it’s a racist highway, and we’ve got to pay to tear it down. Amy Stelly was enthused by this. ""I'm floored,"" she said. ""I’m thrilled to hear President Biden would call out the Claiborne Expressway as a racist highway."" Presumably, the highway is sexist, transphobic and dog whistles for White supremacy, not to mention QAnon insurrections. Gotta tear it down. Expect a lot more highways to meet this fate. People who believe highways are racist will get tens of billions of dollars as part of this plan, as long as they're in what the Biden administration calls ""underserved communities."" The entirety of this ""infrastructure plan"" is more like a mashup of intersectional theory from Weslyan and some kind of South Africa-style racial spoils system. We saw a taste of that earlier in the year, when Joe Biden sent billions of dollars to African-American farmers in this country purely because of how they looked. Now, that’s illegal, immoral and completely divisive, but it’s just the beginning. In his infrastructure bill, Joe Biden calls for sending $25 billion to ""historically [B]lack universities"" and other ""minority-serving institutions for research and development."" You may think it’s a good idea (and you should have to explain why), but it’s not infrastructure. He also wants to ""eliminate exclusionary zoning"" and ""needless barriers to producing affordable housing."" So your neighborhoods may have to make way for ""multi-family dwellings."" You don’t want multi-family dwellings in your neighborhood? Doesn’t matter. It’s equity. Shut up, racist. And there’s more where’re that came from. Joe Biden also wants $100 billion for workplace development to, ""reduce racial inequities in job training and hiring."" Huh? That doesn’t sound like eliminating racial discrimination in hiring, it sounds like mandating it. ""Wait a minute,"" you might be wondering. ""What does hiring people with certain skin colors have to do with infrastructure? Sorry to keep bringing us back to the point, but the point was supposed to be infrastructure."" It’s not, really. And Democrats aren’t really pretending it is anymore. Democrats are in charge, this is their chance to take total control of the economy, and they're going to use it. This is why you don't want the ""theory"" people in charge of anything. Sleazeball politicians of old would make the case: ""Vote for me and I’ll fix the potholes."" They may have stolen some of the money you sent them, but in the end, they had to fix the potholes. They promised they would, and your commute got a little better. These people are not about fixing the potholes. It's about ""saving our democracy"" and evolving into a ""multi-racial democracy,"" as if we don't have that already. It's also about something called the ""Green New Deal.""  And it's not simply one deranged theory-addled member of Congress admitting it. According to Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, former Mayor of South Bend, Rhodes Scholar and McKinsey consultant, we need this infrastructure bill to end hurricanes. . So according to climatologist Pete ... Hold on, we thought he was a McKinsey consultant? No, he’s a climate expert. Not even the climate experts understand the climate, that’s how complex it is, but Pete Buttigieg does, and he’s telling you it’s the roads that are causing hurricanes. We never had hurricanes before roads. He’s going to fix that. That explains why there's $46 billion in the bill for the federal government to buy electric vehicles. Now, FBI agents can arrest you for sedition while driving Teslas. ""But, wait a second,"" you ask. ""Aren’t those Teslas powered by electricity made in part by coal plants?"" Yeah, whatever. Shut up, insurrectionist. Another $2 trillion goes to tax credits for ""clean energy generation and storage."" I wonder who owns those firms. Could they be Biden donors? I think so. There's a plan for building 500,000 electric vehicle chargers, an allocation of $174 billion to expand the market of electric vehicles – no one wants to buy them, but the government is going to make you want to  buy them – and another $10 billion for a ""Climate Conservation Corps"" to ""boost climate resilience."" Are they going to buy umbrellas? That would be a useful form of climate resilience. But they’re thinking bigger than that. This is about transforming our democracy. You’ll notice that none of the spending goes towards aiding the oil workers put out of business when Joe Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. They can learn to code. According to the people who are really running the Democratic Party, though, none of this goes far enough. We’ve humiliated the Keystone XL workers and spent $2 trillion, but we need to go further. According to Sandy Cortez, pampered sciion of Westchester, we need to spend a lot more money or else you’re racist. Another math lecture from Sandy. She doesn’t care, by the way. None of them care about the consequences of this. What are the consequences of this, exactly? What happens if all this money gets into the system? Could it affect your life?  Take a look at a chart of commodity prices, and that will give you one sense. The government injected trillions of dollars into the economy, and what happened? The cost of almost every durable good, the things you need to live with, went way up. The price of lumber jumped more than 250%. Crude oil jumped 188%. Sugar, 50%.  Copper and tin went up by more than 80% each, and so on. It became a lot more expensive to live here. That’s fine if you’re Joe Biden or Sandy Cortez. Not fine if you’re you. The cost to buy a home jumped by 11%. According to the United Nations Food Price index, the cost of food has just reached its highest level in seven years. In other words, just by spending a lot of money they didn’t make, the people in charge are making it for much harder for most Americans to live here. That’s the cost of inflation. It’s a tax, and it’s insidious, and it’s impossible to control once it starts. Meanwhile, the most powerful people in the country have never been happier. The cost of apartments in San Francisco has gone way down. The Dow Jones is up by 50%.  Private equity is booming. Cryptocurrency investors are also seeing huge returns. Some of them have so much money they’re making up things to buy. They're investing in things called ""non-fungible tokens,"" or NFTs -- which are literally useless digital tokens. The Nyan Cat meme just sold for $590,000 in ""NFT format."" Now, it’s not the art that was sold. It’s the useless digital token.   if there ever was one. Those are the people who benefit from another $2 trillion in spending. And by the way, the tax increases won't offset all this spending. Joe Biden plans to tax what economists call ""savers,"" which don't bounce around as much in the economy. Taxing savers isn't an effective way to curb inflation, because the money isn't affecting as many transactions. It’s punitive. But the party in charge isn't concerned about inflation. They don't care if it's harder for you to get gas or buy dinner. They're just upset you feel so entitled to drive your vehicle to work on their roads. So the real problem with America is gas prices are too low. So people who don’t live in cities, people who drive for a living, just aren’t paying enough. That’s the problem, and those ungrateful Americans don’t even know it. What’s going on here? Trillions of dollars changing hands. This is looting. Just as their supporters did in Minneapolis last summer, the Biden people are looting the country. They’ve done nothing to build America. Susan Rice, Barack Obama, Ron Klain, and the rest of the people making these decisions haven’t created a single thing. They’re not creators. They’re takers, and they’ve gotten rich doing it. How much did Susan Rice make in the last few years, and how did she make that money? They’re just stripping the corpse. And when it falls apart, they’ll be gone. In the meantime, welcome to hyperinflation.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-infrastructure-bill-not-about-infrastructure
"Media root for Biden’s massive infrastructure plan, casting him as FDR","Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr
"Nets get strong debut from Aldridge, rout Hornets 111-89","LaMarcus Aldridge made his   debut and found playing in the post to be a breeze on a team so potent from the perimeter. ""It was easy for me, so I had fun tonight for sure,"" Aldridge said. Easy for the whole team, actually. Jeff Green outscored   by himself in Brooklyn's overpowering first quarter before finishing with 21 points, and the Nets got a strong first outing from Aldridge in a 111-89 rout of the Hornets on Thursday night. Aldridge started at center and had 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists, looking like a good fit for a Nets team that won for the 20th time in its last 23 games. They signed him last month after he reached a buyout agreement with San Antonio. With All-Stars Kevin Durant and James Harden sitting out with hamstring injuries, the Nets led 32-11 after one quarter behind 12 points from Green. A night earlier, they had to climb out of a 24-6 hole against Houston. ""Tonight we did just what we expected to do coming out of the gate,"" Green said. ""We got stops and defense turned into offense and that’s how we were able to get rolling."" The Nets made 20 3-pointers and put six players in double figures in their season-best seventh straight home win. Landry Shamet scored 17 points in his return from a five-game absence with a sprained right ankle and Kyrie Irving had 15 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Gordon Hayward and Devonte Graham each scored 13 points for Charlotte. Terry Rozier had 12. A game televised nationally on TNT was already watered down by the absences of some of its biggest stars, with Harden and Durant sidelined in Brooklyn and Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball lost to a broken right wrist. Those who still watched didn't have reason to do so for long, Charlotte missed 19 of its 23 shots in the first quarter. The Nets then began featuring Aldridge, who had seven points and assisted on the other basket in a 10-2 spurt that pushed the lead to 47-18 in the second quarter. Brooklyn led by 32 in the third quarter, when Charlotte had another miserable period with only 17 points. ""I mean, we just could not find any offensive rhythm,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""It was a rough night on that end of the floor."" Harden left the Nets' victory over Houston on Wednesday with right hamstring tightness. Coach Steve Nash said Harden was day to day and should return within the next few games, but Durant's absence will last at least into next week. He's been out since mid-February with a strained left hamstring. Hornets: Malik Monk returned after a two-game absence with a sore right foot but had to be helped off the floor in the fourth quarter with what Borrego said was a sprained right ankle. He scored 11 points. Nets: Brooklyn rested Blake Griffin on the second night of the back-to-back. ... With Aldridge starting, DeAndre Jordan, the Nets' starting center in 36 of their first 48 games, didn't play. Durant spoke before the game and said he isn't in much pain and is looking forward to rejoining his teammates soon. He also   he used in private messages to Michael Rapaport that the actor shared on Twitter this week. Harden was voted Eastern Conference player of the month for March after also winning the award in February. He is the first player to win player of the month honors in both of his first two full months with a new team since the award’s inception in 1979-80. Ball won the Eastern Conference rookie of the month despite playing in just eight games. It was the third consecutive monthly win for the guard. Hornets: Visit Indiana on Friday.

"Trump, Biden, Fauci, Birx: Why finger-pointing is surging as COVID-19 cases rise","Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise

"California, New York localities push reparations through Universal Basic Income","Race-based universal basic income payments are starting to gain steam in the U.S. as a form of reparation. Last week, Marin County in California   payments of $1,000 per month for all women of color. In New York,   mayor has also suggested leveraging revenues from   legalization to pay reparations to Black and Brown residents. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren on Thursday sent a letter to a Latino-focused nonprofit requesting it to join her administration on an exploratory committee to look into the issue. Warren suggested utilizing a universal basic income (UBI) or home ownership program for assisting certain communities. ""Beyond changing policies and procedures, we must do more to close the wealth gap between Black and Brown people and our White residents,"" Warren said in the letter to the Ibero-American Action League. ""With marijuana legalization on the horizon in New York, we have an opportunity we never had before to bring real resources to bear to uplift our families and improve, not just their financial wellbeing, but their very future."" Marin County is contributing $400,000 to its program, with the remainder of the estimated $3 million coming from the Marin Community Foundation.  The program is slightly modeled after a similar one that ran from February 2019 to February 2020 in Stockton, California. The Marin County program, however, has a couple of conditions for residents to receive payments: recipients must be women of color and have a child under the age of 18. When asked by Fox News for comment on the program and whether or not the Marin Community Foundation believed the program was discriminatory, foundation president and CEO Thomas Peters said that this ""initial program"" is directed at women of color who carry a ""double-weighted burden in their path to self-sufficiency."" He also said the reason to target women of color specifically was ""not for any reason of exclusion, but because we are laser-focused on an area of greatest need."" ""Our pilot program is the next phase in a research study we conducted last year focused on low-income Moms who are struggling to care for their families and better their educational and economic standing.  No surprise but still quite dismaying, we found that the women who are grappling with the most serious difficulties of all are Moms of color, who face not only financial challenges but the daily imposition of overt and covert discrimination,"" said Peters. Warren's letter comes after last week's report by the Commission on Racial and Structural Equity, which argued that racism is ""deeply embedded in the culture and practices of Rochester and Monroe County."" The report   that it found hardly any laws in the city and county ""which created and sustained racist policies.""  However, the commission added they had found ""practices and conditions where diversity of race, ethnicity and gender are nearly non-existent; where people of color are unable to fully participate and are implicitly or explicitly excluded from opportunities that could enhance their economic, social and mental health; and where people of color are denied the opportunity to participate in the rule-making and decision-making that shapes our lives, from birth to death."" According to Warren's letter, the exploratory committee would review UBI and reparation pilot programs in other cities. It specifically mentions Evanston, Illinois, and   both of which are pursuing monetary assistance for Black families. In Oakland, the payments consist of $500 in monthly payments for 18 months to 600 families who are Black, indigenous, or people of color. Mayor Warren's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/california-new-york-reparations-universal-basic-income
"US to have indirect nuclear deal talks, Iran quickly pushes back","The   administration announced Friday that it would begin indirect   deal talks with   next week, with other   powers acting as intermediaries. The U.S. plans to meet Tuesday in Vienna, Austria, with representatives from Europe, Russia and China to ""identify the issues involved in a mutual return to compliance,"" a State Department spokesperson told Fox News.  A diplomat familiar with discussions says they’ve managed expectations heading into the meetings, but Iran quickly pushed back that there were no direct talks planned for Iranian and American officials. The indirect talks are a sign that the Biden administration plans to move in the opposite direction of former President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from the   in 2018 and has long said the agreement with   is one of the worst, ""decaying and rotten."" Talks with Iran -- even indirect ones -- would be a major geopolitical step forward for the administration, which has tried to bring the Middle East power to the negotiating table since President Biden took office. ""These talks will be structured around working groups that the EU is going to form with the remaining participants in the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action], including Iran,"" the State Department spokesperson said.  ""We do not anticipate presently that there will be direct talks between the United States and Iran through this process, though the United States remains open to them."" However, Iran has already indicated that it will reject any indirect talks or ""step-by-step lifting of sanctions,"" its state-run Press TV reported on Friday, quoting an unnamed source.  ""In line with the unchangeable guideline of Iran's [Supreme] Leader, any result of the [nuclear accord commission] which would be based on the idea of a step-by-step removal of the sanctions or indirect negotiations with the U.S. will not be acceptable,"" the source said, according to Press TV's website. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif immediately stressed that no meeting was planned between officials from Iran and the U.S. In a tweet, Zarif said the aim of the Vienna session would be ""rapidly finalize sanction-lifting & nuclear measures for choreographed removal of all sanctions, followed by Iran ceasing remedial measures."" Trump faced immediate criticism for his decision to walk away from the deal, which had been brokered in 2015 under then-President Barack Obama. Supporters applauded Trump’s decision as a ""strong statement,"" but media scrutiny claimed that Trump’s decision would ""isolate"" the U.S.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/us-indirect-nuclear-talks-iran-not-acceptable

""I don't have any idea, I have no idea whether or not."" Asked whether it ""could"" have been his laptop, Hunter Biden responded: ""Of course certainly. It, it, there could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the — that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me."" Hunter Biden's answer at least partially contradicts a comment President Biden made as recently as December that he thought the laptop and the information on it were the products of a Russian smear campaign.  ""Yes. Yes. Yes,"" Biden told Fox News' Peter Doocy on Dec. 22 when asked if he thought the laptop was Russian disinformation. ""God love ya man. You are a one horse pony."" In a separate interview with CBS, Hunter Biden delved into how his family's handled his addiction troubles, including telling the story of a time his father chased him down the family's driveway to keep him from leaving an intervention.  ""And your father chased you?""

No, no.’ This was the hardest part of the book to write."" ""And he grabbed me in a hug,"" Hunter continued, referring to his father. 'He grabbed me, gave a bear hug, and he said — and just cried and said, ‘I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. Please —’"" At that moment, Hunter Biden told CBS, he struggled to appreciate the gesture because of the grip of his addiction. ""I thought, ‘I need to figure out a way to tell him that I’m going to do something so that I can go take another hit,’"" Biden said. He added: ""It’s the only thing I could think. Literally. That’s how powerful. I don’t know of a force more powerful than my family’s love. Except addiction."" The full in-depth interviews, set to air on Sunday and Monday, will also include information about the Department of Justice investigation into Hunter Biden and more, according to CBS.  The interviews come ahead of the publication of Hunter's book titled ""Beautiful Things"" later this month.

The Associated Press released new polling data on Friday that illustrated the fact that the majority of Americans are behind laws requiring photo identification to access the ballot box. The data show the vast majority of Republicans are in favor of requiring an ID to vote with over half of Democrats joining them in backing the idea. Only 24% of Democrats opposed the laws. Overall, 72% of American adults approve of requiring photo identification to vote, illuminating a sharp contrast between Democratic voters and the message the party has been pushing in the wake of Georgia’s new voting law. Georgia has taken center stage in the voter ID battle, where critics of the new law say it suppresses the vote. Progressives say that voter ID laws   the ability of minorities to vote and that the laws are racist.  The Peach State's new law expands early voting access by requiring two Saturdays of early voting as well as two optional Sundays. Additionally, it creates a mandate for vote drop boxes to be placed in each county in Georgia and requires that voters show a state-issued driver's license or ID card. Multiple political and business leaders have spoken out against the law. President   recently   four ""Pinocchios"" from The Washington Post for repeating the false claim that the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/voter-id-poll-americans-approve-georgia-bill
