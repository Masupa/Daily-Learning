0,British taxpayers funded EU factory at heart of vaccine row,"British taxpayers have invested millions of pounds into a Dutch vaccine factory at the   by the European Commission, The Telegraph can disclose. The Halix factory in Leiden was equipped to produce doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine after Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, approved a major investment last April. The money – reported to be in the region of £21 million – was meant to secure vital shipments to the UK. But Brussels has threatened to ban exports and on Thursday  , insisting that the doses should be diverted to European nations.  A leaked letter revealed that Oxford scientists urged a major EU nation to invest in the Halix factory alongside the UK last April, but the deal was never signed.  The European Union would have been likely to have secured millions of AstraZeneca doses had the Dutch government acted more decisively, sources suggested. An EU official admitted the bloc had yet to contribute a single euro towards the Halix plant. MPs suggested on Thursday night that Downing Street should ask for its money back. Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said: ""We invested in this plant. We have contractual entitlements to vaccines. If the EU disagrees with those entitlements, they have the option of going to court. ""Even in my worst Eurosceptic moments, I would never have dreamt the EU would behave like this.""  The news that Britain funded the very vaccine factory now at the centre of the EU blockade comes as a major shortfall in AstraZeneca supplies threatens to disrupt the  GPs have been told to stop administering first doses this month and focus their vaccine resources primarily on those awaiting their second jabs. Downing Street says the UK remains on target to  . The Government has entered into negotiations with the EU over the doses produced at the Halix plant, which gained approval from the European regulator last week. Sources said the factory was ready to produce five million doses of raw vaccine every month. But Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner,   until AstraZeneca had fulfilled its commitments to Brussels, even after Germany   for people aged below 60 because of fears of rare blood clots. ""If [AstraZeneca] does more, we don't have any issue, but as long as it doesn't deliver its commitment to us, the doses stay in Europe,"" Mr Breton said. ""There is no negotiation."" Whitehall sources, however, pointed out that the UK guaranteed millions of pounds to the Halix factory in April last year – before the Oxford vaccine had been proven effective. The University of Oxford signed a deal with the Dutch firm after identifying the brand new Halix plant as suitable for building up capacity for millions of doses. Scientists from the university then approached  with a request for 10 million euros to build barrels capable of holding 1,000 litres of raw vaccine. ""There will probably be a huge demand for vaccines if they successfully pass the tests,"" the scientists wrote in a letter leaked to the Dutch broadcaster NOS. ""Most likely, the quantities of available vaccines will be limited for several months. To avoid major delays, production capacity must be increased now."" But the Dutch failed to sign the deal despite entering initial talks with Halix. The failure to invest meant the EU missed the chance to secure millions of doses for itself, sources suggested. According to the Dutch media, the promised UK investment was in the region of 25 million Euros, around £21m, although a Department of Health source said the precise reported figure was ""incorrect"". On Thursday night, an EU official admitted the bloc had yet to contribute any cash to the Halix factory, saying: ""We have checked for any EU funding possibly given to Halix under EU financial instruments but could not identify any support. This does not prejudge any national funding given by member states."" Sir John Bell, Regius professor at the University of Oxford and a leading figure in the development of the AstraZeneca jab, said dealing with the EU had been like ""pulling teeth"". ""It has just been a nightmare,  ,"" he said. ""And then they turn round and say the jab isn't safe. I would say it is time for the EU to make its mind up."" The stand-off over the Halix factory is further complicated by Brussels' demand for vaccines from the  , which manufacture the vast majority of the AstraZeneca jabs used by Britain. The commission wants Boris Johnson to release AstraZeneca from  , which gives Britain first refusal on jabs. It argues that the EU contract with AstraZeneca counts the two British plants as part of the bloc's supply chain. Brussels has   and believes   for the completion of its vaccination campaign. Twenty million Pfizer jabs have been exported to the UK since December, leading some sources to claim that the British success was ""made in the EU"". UK-EU negotiations over the Halix supplies are expected to continue next week. The UK regulator is yet to grant it approval, although a million doses were exported from Halix to the UK for clearance between December and last month. Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission,   allowing Brussels to target countries with higher vaccination rates than the EU and low exports to the EU, like Britain. EU leaders, wary that the UK could block the export of raw vaccine materials to the EU, stopped short of explicitly backing her plans at a summit but insisted AstraZeneca would have to fulfil its contract before being allowed to export. A spokesman for AstraZeneca refused to comment. But the company said on Tuesday that ""the EU supply chain is overwhelmingly for the EU"". A University of Oxford spokesman said: ""We are not aware of any formal letter sent by Oxford University to the Dutch government. However, the vaccine team did approach a wide range of potential funding partners in early 2020 before the partnership was struck with AstraZeneca.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/british-taxpayers-funded-eu-factory-heart-vaccine-row/
1,Why Ursula von der Leyen won't quit over AstraZeneca vaccine row,"Ursula von der Leyen has no plans to quit after last week’s coronavirus vaccine fiasco, despite suffering the worst week of her career as president of the European Commission.  Today she  for the vaccine fiasco and instead urged Europeans to judge her in three years time at the end of her term in office.  She is facing unprecedented criticism across the EU after her gaffe-strewn handling of the row with AstraZeneca.  Brussels’ threat to  , and the slow roll-out of vaccinations across the bloc have increased the pressure on the former German defence minister.  As far as Mrs von der Leyen, who has   commissioner and is accused of centralising all power in her small circle of trusted advisors, is concerned she is going nowhere.  In truth, there is little political appetite in the European Parliament, which can remove a commission president, or in EU capitals for Mrs von der Leyen to go.  The European Commission is playing an important role in the procurement of vaccines and the coordination of coronavirus measures among the member states.  Defenestrating its president now, with the pandemic raging and a massive economic stimulus package to be rolled out, is still seen as self-defeating.  It would trigger a long process to replace her and, possibly the whole college of commissioner, which would cost valuable time.  There is no ready made replacement waiting in the wings and, even if they had the power to force her out, member states were responsible for appointing her in the first place and won’t want to publicise their error. A fragmented European Parliament approved Mrs von der Leyen with a majority of just nine votes and the fiasco has cost her some support, which could impact her ability to get EU law passed.  It is true that those EU governments less enamoured of Brussels overreach would welcome having a lame duck commission president in place.  Both EU governments and the European Parliament will also be keen to avoid a clash over the method used to choose the president.  EU leaders, led by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, ditched the Spitzenkandidat system, which tied the results of the European elections to the top job. Much to the fury of the European Parliament, they returned to the summit stitch-ups that had chosen all commission presidents except Jean-Claude Juncker.  Promises were made to return to the failed experiment in democracy in the future, which even the frequently supine MEPs would insist upon if Mrs von der Leyen was to go.  Any British politician who faced  would be expected to at least consider their position or quit, as Theresa May did.  Resignations in response to failure have sadly fallen out of fashion in Westminster but have rarely been à la mode in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.  The sole president of the European Commission to fall on his sword was Jacques Santer, who resigned in 1999 before he was removed by MEPs amid a corruption scandal  Jean-Claude Juncker stayed resolutely in post when the beginning of his presidency was engulfed by the Luxleaks scandal, which exposed his role in Luxembourg’s sweetheart tax deals with multinationals.  To British observers it may appear incredible that Mrs von der Leyen will survive her botched handling of the pandemic.  But while Europe’s capitals, grateful for a scapegoat for their own national failings in the pandemic, are more than happy to drag her over the coals, there is no political appetite to replace her. ""In this crisis the commission saw a chance for itself to act as a government but governments sometimes step down when things go wrong or at least are held accountable by their parliaments,"" one EU diplomat said.  ""Having said that, member states have allowed them to do this because they are too busy managing their own crisis.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/02/02/ursula-von-der-leyen-wont-quit-astrazeneca-vaccine-row/
2,Owen Paterson on the agony of his wife's suicide: 'It's horrifying to think she was suffering so badly without us knowing',"When the police told Owen Paterson his wife Rose had been found   of their Shropshire home, his last desperate hope was that she had been murdered. “In some ways that would have been easier to process than suicide,” admits the former cabinet minister. “That is how terrible suicide is for those left behind. It is just so hard to comprehend how someone could be so desperate that they feel this is the only way out. “Here we are, seven months on, and it’s absolutely horrifying to think that Rose was also suffering so badly without us knowing. “I miss her so much, and so often find myself on the point of calling her, as if she is still with us. The fact that we’ll never speak again is nothing short of devastating.""  The pain is etched on the veteran politician’s face as he describes how he can no longer listen to the Mozart that was played at their 1980 wedding, or Cockney Rebel, the Steve Harley song that provided the soundtrack to their days together at the University of Cambridge in the Seventies. But it is seeing their 21-month-old granddaughter, Sylvie, that brings home the  , which affects 16 families in Britain every single day.  “Rose will never see her first daubed paintings, she will never go to her first school play. It's just so desperately sad.” Owen, who has been the MP for North Shropshire for 23 years, has decided to speak candidly about Rose’s death for the first time to a national newspaper in the hope that it will help others. “If I can help stop just one family from experiencing the utter agony we have gone through, then I will have done something worthwhile,” insists the former environment and Northern Ireland secretary. With his sons Felix, 34, Ned, 32 and daughter Evie, 28, Owen is poised to launch The Rose Paterson Trust, a charity dedicated to raising money for  , suicide bereavement and projects promoting mental and physical health. The Trust has recently been awarded charitable status and will be officially unveiled on the day of the Grand National on April 10, in honour of Rose, who was chairman of Aintree Racecourse.  The Grand National has always been a big day for the family, but this year they hope that it will enable them to do some real good in Rose’s memory. “Rose was such a kind and caring person by nature,” said Owen. “We know she would want us to help others. She did so much for charity herself. We just want to make her proud.” Owen had no idea that his beloved wife of 40 years was feeling suicidal in the days before she was found dead in the early hours of June 24, his 64th birthday. When she did not answer his telephone calls from the House of Commons on the morning she went missing, he did not think anything of it.  As well as her work with Aintree and as a Steward of the Jockey Club, Rose would often be out and about, too busy to respond to messages.  But when calls to their home near Ellesmere continued to go unanswered at 6pm that evening, Owen began to worry. “I wasn’t entirely surprised she hadn’t got back to me because she would often be out in the garden or at Aintree. “But she’d nearly always be back by the evening because she was very punctilious about keeping on top of emails.” After another couple of hours went by with no word from Rose, Ned, who was the last person to see her the previous evening, watching a TV documentary on Persian history, raised the alarm. By 8.15pm, Owen had called the police. “That’s when the whole nightmare began,” he recalls. As more and more neighbours joined the effort to find Rose, he jumped in the car with Felix, who lives in south London, and immediately drove to Shropshire. Throughout the 200-mile journey north, they were in constant communication with Ned.  “We went through everything over and over: heart attack, stroke, some respiratory collapse. Had she slipped and banged her head on a rock? Had a branch fallen on her head? We had all these crazy ideas. We never, ever thought of suicide.” Arriving home as a helicopter circled overhead, the lead police officer on the case walked straight up to Owen and asked him a question he will never forget. “Looking back, he knew exactly what he was looking for,” Owen concedes. “He said, ‘Mr Paterson, does your wife suffer from depression?’ Irritated, Owen dismissed the idea and stressed the urgency of finding his wife alive.  “I said: ‘Please, I'm really worried, it’s been a really hot June day, she'll be out there dehydrating’.” By then it was half past midnight. “We could see them with their torches working the wood very methodically. We did hear some shouting and then the shouting stopped.  “At around 4am, the Police called us into the kitchen and said they’d found a female body and the appearance conformed to Rose Paterson.” At that point Owen demanded that Rose’s body not be taken down until he had had the chance to see her for a final time. “I hoped it would be anything but suicide. But when I went down there, it was quite obvious that she’d killed herself.” He then had to break the horrendous news to the couple’s daughter, Evie, 28, who was on holiday in France, awaiting Rose’s arrival the following day. West Mercia police later informed the family that Rose had been searching suicide websites a fortnight before, at seven in the morning.  “People say, ‘Oh you mustn’t beat yourself up' but of course I beat myself up every single day,” said Owen. The timing, on his birthday, only added to the family’s sense of bewilderment. Rose had been planning to travel to London that day to see an aunt who had just come out of lockdown, before organising a birthday dinner for Owen and then travelling out to France. She was also chairing a virtual meeting at Aintree.     “All the papers are still on her desk,” said Owen. “I just can’t bear to move them. “What is utterly tragic is that Rose's career was really blossoming. She’d done wonderful work at Aintree on animal welfare and making it more inclusive to women and families. She was doing some terrific stuff for Park Palace Ponies, an inner-city riding school in Toxteth."" Although the inquest into Rose’s death in  , she had not been on any medication for several years. “The coroner answers the who, what, when, where, how questions but never the why,"" said Owen. ""We will never definitively know why.” The couple had been under some pressure since the last general election, following a number of press reports about Owen’s external consultancy work. There had also been criticism of the racing industry for allowing the  . Owen believes them both catching Covid-19 at the beginning of the first lockdown may have had an impact on Rose’s mental health. “Rose didn’t like being ill and with the family at home she rallied round and seemed to get better far sooner than I did. “But ongoing research into the virus shows that, while it has a bigger, physical effect on men, women are disproportionately affected neurologically. Some it seems have had mini strokes and others behavioural changes.” He also blames the suicide websites she secretly visited for “drawing her in”. “Many of these suicides are on impulse. The narrative these sites use is so beguiling and it's written in such calm language.  “Yet these sites never talk about the damage on those you leave behind.” Citing evidence which suggests every suicide affects 135 people, he adds: “I feel quite strongly that if she had known the utter catastrophe she's brought on herself and many people – not just immediate family – she wouldn’t have done it. “Every suicide is unnecessary. Every suicide is avoidable. “The utter tragedy of this is Rose – a wonderful woman who everyone loved so very much – has lost her life and our lives have been changed forever.” Owen’s first Christmas in more than four decades without Rose passed in a “blur” with him spending two freezing cold hours at her grave side at the family home.  “I just wanted to be next to her,"" he said. ""I played Schubert and Mahler and stuff that she loved.” The daughter of the 4th Viscount Ridley, who was brought up on the Blagdon Estate in Northumberland, Rose had a fierce intellect and an unparalleled knowledge of horses.  “I miss her brain,"" said Owen. ""I had a second brain. She was incredibly well read and she kept me up to date on stuff. I can already feel all my racing knowledge slipping away because she's not here.” Admitting he had no previous experience of suicide, he is now trying to educate himself to help others. “If one person reading this, just one person, thinks twice about taking their own life, then it will be worth it. “Society has this image of someone who is caricatured as depressed, whose life has gone badly wrong. Rose was anxious but I wouldn't say she was depressed. “So if anyone reading this knows someone who is anxious, then please just talk to them. You may well be saving their life.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/29/owen-paterson-agony-wifes-suicide-horrifying-think-suffering/
3,A year of coronavirus lockdown: How Boris Johnson's hospitalisation sparked a 'jostling for position' in No10,"Ever since his   last year, debate has raged about the extent to which the experience changed Boris Johnson's approach to tackling the pandemic. His most loyal aides have always insisted it did not change him at all – but some allies now privately concede that he emerged from his hospital stay a different man. ""That whole near-death experience made him look at this through a different lens,"" said one. ""After he came out of hospital... he started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War."" Irrespective of the effect his illness had on him, Mr Johnson's   was almost certainly the closest Britain has come to losing a Prime Minister in office since Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Now, for the first time, some of those who were closest to the centre of power while Mr Johnson's life hung in the balance have spoken about both the moment they feared they might lose him and the Cabinet in-fighting his absence prompted. The Prime Minister was taken into hospital  . While he fought for his life, another battle was going on at the heart of Government. ""It became a bit of a power struggle between different ministers,” said one well-placed source. ""We were trying to keep team spirit together, but Michael [Gove] and Dom Raab were taking chunks out of each other. It was just awful. ""There was a lot of talk of how Dom was trying to consolidate power, Michael was trying to muscle in on various committees and there was just lots of this noise going on. ""The PM was the final decision-maker, meaning that while he was in hospital it all went to Raab – but Gove didn't like that at all."" Another senior source said: ""There was an element of Gove and Hancock auditioning to be PM. But Raab did an excellent job. He earned everyone's respect by standing in, but not trying to be PM."" Others disagree. “We all know that Gove can be like that but during that period he categorically wasn’t,” said one, before adding. “Admittedly, I can’t say it was all peace and harmony...there was a bit of unease from the usual suspects and Cabinet colleagues had conversations with members who were being a little bit snippy.” A Government source said the claims were ""total nonsense"" and that the Cabinet ""really rallied together"", with no tension between the ""quad"" of senior ministers in charge in Mr Johnson's absence. It was on the evening of Thursday, March 26 that Mr Johnson  , telling the nation he had ""mild symptoms"" but was continuing to lead the Government while self-isolating. ""He was working from Rishi Sunak's office because it is below the flat in Number 11 where he and Carrie [Symonds] live,"" recalled one member of his team. ""The only people allowed to see him face to face were Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary, and Lee Cain, his director of communications. ""There is a study and a private office with a door in between, and Martin and Lee would go into the other room and speak to him through the open door.""  Ms Symonds, Mr Johnson's fiancee, was   because she was heavily pregnant. But as his mandatory one-week self-isolation period neared its end, he was getting worse, not better. ""It was obvious he was getting more ill,"" said a source close to him. ""He was doing video messages for Twitter but he was taking five or six goes to get it right, where he is normally a one-take guy. Whenever people told him to take it easy, he kept saying: 'Strong like bull, strong like bull.' Except he wasn't. One time he said that and he beat his chest, which triggered an uncontrollable coughing fit."" Mr Johnson was having to manage without his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who had   on March 27, the day after the Prime Minister had tested positive, and remained there until April 13 after suffering Covid-like symptoms. By the evening of Friday, April 3 staff were so concerned about Mr Johnson that a doctor was called, and on the Sunday that followed he called his key staff to tell them he was going into hospital. At the time Downing Street said it was a ""precautionary measure"" – but behind the scenes it was a different story. ""There was such a change in him,"" said one member of his team. ""He wasn't fully engaging in conversations and he was detached."" Officials checked with him that he wanted Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary,   if he became incapacitated. He confirmed that Mr Raab was ""100 per cent"" his choice. Mr Johnson's blood oxygen levels had fallen dangerously low, and by the next day, Monday, April 6, ""the doctors were telling us it was looking pretty grisly"", one source said. Nominally at least, the Prime Minister remained in charge of the country, but at around 5.30pm that day, while Mr Raab was taking a turn to host the daily Downing Street press conference, the phone on the desk of Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, rang.  Sir Mark, who had been watching the press conference with his deputy Helen MacNamara, James Slack, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, and Mr Reynolds, answered the call, which was from St Thomas's Hospital. ""It was one of the two Nicks that rang,"" said a senior source [Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart were in charge of Mr Johnson's care]. ""They said they were going to move him to intensive care. They said it was a ghastly situation because it was 50/50 whether he would need to go onto a ventilator, and if he did go onto a ventilator it was 50/50 whether he would survive."" In fact, the survival odds for Covid patients who were intubated were even lower than that at the time. Another source said: ""Undoubtedly that Monday evening was the lowest point. Going to bed that night was a scary time because you didn't know what you were going to wake up to the next day."" After the phone call from the hospital, ""things moved incredibly quickly"", one insider recalled. After Mr Raab finished his press conference he was called into Sir Mark's office and told he was going to have to take over. Mr Cain had finished his own period of self-isolation that afternoon and drove to Downing Street, where he became ""the Prime Minister's mouth in absentia"", as one official described it. The official said: ""There was a fear that the PM could die and everybody was determined to keep the ship moving on. A Cabinet call was arranged so everyone could be updated."" One person who was in Number 10 at the time said: ""It was surreal when we found out – it hit us like a freight train. There weren't many of us in Downing Street that day because a lot of people were working from home, so there wasn't much time to process it. We just had to get on with the job in hand."" Mr Raab was sent onto the airwaves to reassure the nation that the Prime Minister was ""in safe hands"". At St Thomas's, opposite Parliament on the other side of the Thames, Mr Johnson was  , as he later said himself. He recalled in an interview last May that ""the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction"" and that ""the doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin' type scenario. ""I was not in particularly brilliant shape, and I was aware there were contingency plans in place."" Back in Downing Street, staff avoided talking about what would happen if Mr Johnson died. ""They were pretty tough days,"" said one insider. ""We were trying to source PPE [personal protective equiopment] every morning. Meanwhile, the PM was getting a lot of oxygen and it was very scary for him. It wasn't until the Thursday that the messages from the hospital started to get more positive."" Along with Mr Raab, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor were the ministers at the forefront of running the country while Mr Johnson remained in hospital. One source said the balance between saving lives and saving the economy shifted when Mr Johnson was off sick. ""The debate started when the PM was in hospital,"" said the source. ""Sedwill was pro opening up. The two big political operators are the PM and the Chancellor and when the PM is away the officials gravitate towards the big beast who is left, who was the Chancellor."" Mr Raab was helped in Downing Street by Mr Reynolds, Mr Cain, Mr Slack and Isaac Levido, a pollster who had previously worked on the general election campaign and had been drafted in from the private sector to help out in the crisis. Mr Cain, a former tabloid journalist whose previous jobs famously included dressing in a chicken costume to taunt David Cameron during the 2010 election campaign, effectively stood in for Mr Johnson in key meetings by telling Mr Raab what the Prime Minister's thinking was on any given subject. ""Lee was cited on the papers that were being sent to Raab,"" said one source. ""He got every box that went to Raab, and in the same way that he would challenge things before they got to the PM, Lee did that for Raab. He was the intermediary."" Another source said: ""Lee was basically running the joint. Raab stepped in but Lee was very much running the Number 10 operation. He was in all of the key meetings with Raab, as the PM's right-hand man in the room, saying what the PM would have done. I can't recall anything on which he and Raab disagreed."" Mr Johnson was discharged from hospital on April 12, a week after he had been admitted, and  . Although no one knew it at the time, it was the same day as Mr Cummings was making   to ""test his eyesight"" before returning to London the next day. At Chequers, Mr Johnson was soon resuming work calls with, among others, the Queen and the then-US president, Donald Trump. Mr Trump  : ""He sounded incredible, he was ready to go – it's like the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" Mr Cummings, meanwhile, was becoming ever more evangelical about the benefits of lockdown. ""He had always been in favour of lockdown, and argued for doing it earlier than we did,"" said one former colleague. ""While he was off sick he read loads of stuff about pandemics and came back telling everyone that the countries that did best were the ones that locked down early and didn't unlock too soon. He said those countries lost fewer people and took a smaller hit to their economies."" Mr Johnson  , ""probably a week too early"", one aide now admits, and told the nation there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" of the virus. Two days later, his son Wilfred was born. So what effect did the Prime Minister’s darkest hour have on him?  “I do think it changed him,” said one friend of the Prime Minister. “He had been very hesitant about putting the country into lockdown, but after he came out of hospital it’s all been about protecting lives. “He started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War.” ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Britain has already lost more people to the virus than died in the Blitz, but the war cost 450,000 British lives in total, or 0.94 per cent of the population, including 383,000 in the Armed Forces. To date, Covid has taken 125,000 lives, or around 0.2 per cent of the population. Those most loyal to Mr Johnson continue to hold to the official line that the events of last April made no difference to his policies. ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Another Johnson loyalist said: “It didn’t change him at all. Both before and after he went into hospital he kept saying it was important the cure wasn’t worse than the virus.”",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/18/year-coronavirus-lockdown-boris-johnsons-hospitalisation-sparked/
4,EU's 'most embarrassing' day: How the AstraZeneca vaccine factory raid unravelled,"It was an extraordinary story – the European Commission   to find AstraZeneca's secret stockpile of vaccines reserved for Britain. During a surprise raid over the weekend, an elite unit of Italian military police acting on EU orders  . The discovery appeared to confirm the EU's long-held suspicion that AstraZeneca was giving the UK special treatment, secretly exporting doses to its home country while failing to deliver on contracts agreed with Brussels. Yet, as EU officials  , the allegation, briefed to the Continental press, simply wasn't true. In fact, most of the doses discovered in the Italian factory were destined for the EU itself, with the remainder headed for poorer countries across the world. One former Europe minister called it possibly the ""most embarrassing day in the EU's history"". Italy's La Stampa newspaper reported that Italian officers had  , where doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are put into vials and labelled. The raid was carried out by the NAS, an elite unit of the Carabinieri which is part of the armed forces and usually investigates criminal syndicates suspected of counterfeiting food, wine and medicines. After inspecting the company's records, the officers   – roughly half AstraZeneca's delivery shortfall to the EU. EU sources briefed the newspaper that the shipment was thought to be secretly bound for the UK, despite the company having fallen far short of its promised deliveries to the bloc.  Italian authorities ordered the raid after Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market, raised suspicions during a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Leiden, the Netherlands, earlier this month.  The commission issued the alert after Mr Breton suggested the numbers provided by AstraZeneca executives did not add up, suggesting a discrepancy between the reported overall supply and the number of doses reported by individual AstraZeneca factories. The raid came weeks after the Italian government   from the same factory under the EU's new export ban rules. The explosive news of a ""hidden"" bumper cache of jabs destined for the UK was quickly picked up by newspapers across the Continent. By mid-morning, however, the story began to unravel. British Government officials quickly insisted that supplies from the Catalent factory ""haven't been coming to the UK and we are not expecting anything from there"". Mario Gargiulo, the president of European biologics for Catalent, said the inspection by the Carabinieri had found ""everything in order"". Soon afterwards,  officials in Brussels admitted that the 29 million doses were in fact destined for AstraZeneca's plant in Belgium for onward distribution around the EU. An Italian government official said: ""On Saturday, the European Commission asked the prime minister to verify several consignments of vaccine in a production plant in Anagni. ""The Prime Minister informed the minister of health, Roberto Speranza, who arranged for the inspection to be carried out between Saturday and Sunday by the Carabinieri NAS. It emerged that the inspected batches were destined for Belgium. All outgoing batches were inspected."" AstraZeneca later said 16 million of the doses were ""waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe"", while the other 13 million were to go to countries in the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme for developing countries. A spokesman said there were ""no exports currently planned other than to Covax countries"", adding that it was ""incorrect to describe this as a stockpile"". ""The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time-consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed,"" the spokesman said. Mr Breton later told the BBC that he had asked for the raid to ensure everything was on track and it had been ""helpful to understand what was happening in Italy"". But Bruno Maçães, Portugal's former Europe minister, called it possibly ""the most embarrassing day in EU history"". ""So Italian police raids a vaccine factory at suggestion of commission to find out these are vaccines for a global initiative aimed at providing equitable access to vaccines for some of the world's poorest regions? I think we're going to need an explanation of why Italian military police burst into a vaccine factory on false grounds,"" he added. However some EU officials were refusing to give up on Wednesday night, revealing that the commission had asked AstraZeneca for additional information about where the active ingredient in the vaccine vials found in Italy had been manufactured. Brussels sources indicated that the commission suspects that some of the drug substance sent to the Italian plant for packaging could have been produced in the much-scrutinised Halix plant in the Netherlands. So far the plant has not delivered vaccine doses to the EU because it does not have authorisation from European Medicines Agency. Member state officials have questioned why the approval process has not yet been completed, while the company has insisted it is ""on track"".  On Wednesday, AstraZeneca would only say that the vaccine doses had been brought from ""outside the EU"" to be packaged at the Italian plant. Other EU officials cast doubt over the doses reported by AstraZeneca to be destined for the Covax scheme, which the EU has exempted from any export bans. One told the Financial Times of suspicions that shipments ""go to some Covax countries to then be redirected to richer countries"". However, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade commissioner, was unequivocal and said the bloc would not impose any export restrictions on Covax, which plans to distribute two billion doses to poorer and middle income countries before the end of the year.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/24/eus-embarrassing-day-story-behind-vaccine-factory-raid-unravelled/
5,Jean-Claude Juncker attacks Ursula von der Leyen for 'stupid' vaccines trade war with UK,"Jean-Claude Juncker has attacked Ursula von der Leyen, his successor as European Commission president, for starting  Mr Juncker said he was “not a fan” of Mrs von der Leyen’s threat of imposing an export ban on EU manufactured jabs to the UK and warned it would “create major reputational damage” for the bloc. “We used to be the world's free trade champion,"" he said as EU leaders meet for a summit to discuss the potential ban, ""We have to pull back from a vaccine war.” Mr Juncker also criticised the EU for being too slow in approving and buying vaccines, branding the bloc as “too cautious” and “budget conscious” in an interview with BBC’s HardTalk. The veteran politician led the commission from 2014 to 2019, which included the period after the Brexit referendum.  ""We have special relations with Britain, there's room for dialogue [...] nobody in Britain, nobody in Europe understands why we are witnessing such a stupid vaccine war,” Mr Juncker said.  “What the EU is asking for cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere. We are not in war and we are not enemies - we are allies."" The former prime minister of Luxembourg added: ""I don't understand this [EU] temptation to fight against Britain, and the British temptation to fight against the EU. Let's discuss it amongst adult people. What is the image we're giving?'"" The EU summit, forced online because of the third wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe, is being held as new trade rules come into force which allow Brussels to target countries, like Britain, with higher vaccination rates than the EU.  The commission has already threatened to block the export of millions of AstraZeneca vaccines from the company's Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. It wants the UK to forego its first refusal on supplies from AstraZeneca’s two British plants so they can supply the bloc. Divided EU leaders are expected to withhold explicit backing for a ban amid fears it could spark a vaccines trade war. But the pressure on Britain is expected to build because France, Germany and Italy all support Mrs von der Leyen’s plan to threaten bans targeted at AstraZeneca. ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/25/jean-claude-juncker-attacks-ursula-von-der-leyen-stupid-vaccines/
6,1.5 million fewer Scots 'would have been vaccinated under SNP demand to join EU scheme',"More than 1.5 million fewer Scots would have been vaccinated under the SNP's plan to join the shambolic EU programme, the Scottish Tory leader has disclosed as he hailed the ""incredible success"" of the UK roll-out. Douglas Ross said the roll-out demonstrated the overwhelming benefits of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom, with around 2.5 million people having now received their first dose. If   was applied to Scotland, he said this figure would have been only 877,952 and this exposed another ""glaring weakness"" in the nationalist case for separation. Speaking ahead of an election campaign event in which he will set out his NHS spending pledges for the next parliament, Mr Ross said: ""“The SNP are in denial about how much worse off we would be if they had got their way and we were left out of the world-leading UK vaccine scheme."" A series of Ms Sturgeon's ministers demanded the UK sign up to  last year and expressed outrage when Boris Johnson refused. Mike Russell, the Constitution Secretary, warned at the time: ""This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic. It will cost lives."" Maree Todd, the Children's Minister, sarcastically tweeted: ""Of course any drug company in the world who wants to sell a vaccine will definitely come to our relatively tiny market first. Of course they will."" The decision was also publicly opposed by a series of SNP MPs. Instead, the UK Government arranged for British-based AstraZeneca to partner Oxford University to develop the vaccine last year and took the gamble of pouring tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into setting up a production line before there was any proof that the vaccine would work. Mr Johnson also put Kate Bingham, a life sciences venture capitalist, in charge of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce (VTF) and gave her wide discretion to speed up the process and lay steep bets on vaccine candidates. The VTF bought doses early from seven different candidates and has now secured deals for 407 million doses, enough to vaccinate the population many times over. According to a VTF report, joining the EU's procurement bloc would have barred the UK from making outside negotiations. The EU was months behind in signing its own deals with AstraZeneca and German company Pfizer and is now suffering severe shortages amid production problems on the Continent.  Official figures on Wednesday showed 61 deaths were registered in Scotland last week that mentioned Covid on the death certificate, a fall of five from the previous week. Scotland's Covid death toll has dropped every week since Jan 24 and deaths from all causes are below average for this time of year for the third week in a row. Thursday is the last day of the Scottish Government's ""stay at home"" order. Mr Ross said: ""The vaccination rollout has been an incredible success story across Scotland and the United Kingdom. ""My thanks go to our heroic NHS staff, volunteers in our communities and our Armed Forces who have all stepped up to deliver this astonishing achievement."" He said the Scottish Tories would ""fully"" fund the NHS over the next parliament. Pressed how many people would have been vaccinated in an independent Scotland in the EU, Ms Sturgeon admitted the UK was doing ""incredibly well"" but avoided the question by instead arguing that the country would have performed just as well without Brexit. She told ITV News: ""It would still be open to the UK to secure its own vaccines and to take the decisions it has taken."" She also argued the pandemic will only be over ""when the whole world is properly protected and properly vaccinated."" Mairi Gougeon, the SNP's Public Health Minister, said: ""While Boris Johnson apparently told his Tory MPs that the success of the vaccination roll-out is down to 'greed', we know that that isn't the case. It is down to the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and our invaluable National Health Service.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/15-million-fewer-scots-would-have-vaccinated-snp-demand-join/
7,,"It was all so highly predictable. Britain’s great unlock was always going to coincide with a mini heatwave. Starved of vitamin D, we wandered out into the world, desperate for fresh air and frivolity.  By lunchtime on Monday, you could hear a 21-cork salute ringing out across every park and beach in the land. There were picnics in the daffodils and Proseccos by the ponds. And who could blame us? We’d been incarcerated for the best part of a year, stuck at home, doing our bit for the greater good. For a few balmy hours, life felt joyously normal.  But then came the inevitable backlash from the Fun Police. And for every splash of Factor 10, there was a Covid Jobsworth looking to bring the mood down. Curiously, tourist boards began warning people to stay away, despite them not having any authority to do so. The sun was out but the mood felt oddly familiar.  There are no longer any rules restricting travel. The “stay local” message has been quietly lifted. Yet every tourism bod from Land’s End to John o’ Groats still wanted to have their voice heard. Visit Cornwall told people to “visit later” then the MP Nigel Huddleston – whoever he is – told Good Morning Britain that “this is not a free for all”. Either we’re allowed to travel or we’re not? Stop meddling in our business.  I don’t for one minute believe these people do all this out of altruism. I think they’ve just got used to seeing their names in lights. But after a year of taking them seriously, I’m afraid that now is the time for them to fizzle back into obscurity. Surely there’s a filing cabinet that needs organising in the bowels Whitehall? The Government’s culture of constant rulemaking has seeped down through our society, and travel has become the easiest target. Thirteen months ago, you might have wondered if Britain could be any more divided, but then the pandemic came along and carved out fault lines that would make Brexit blush.  We used to argue about fishing policies and blue passports but now we’re huffing and puffing at the sight of Thermos flasks and walking boots. You’ll be lucky if you can build a sandcastle this summer without a latex-gloved spoilsport asking if you’ve sanitised every grain of sand. Twitter’s keyboard warriors, especially, seem to dine out on images of busy beaches and footpaths, vilifying hikers on Snowdon like bank robbers in balaclavas. What next? Slashing the tyres of cyclists who dare head out in a peloton of seven, not six? “So selfish!” screamed one Twitter user on Monday afternoon at the sight of people enjoying themselves in a park.  But what exactly did people expect? A year of draconian lockdowns has created such pent-up demand that this will likely be our reality for years. Moreover, Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, crowds are inevitable. Get over it.  The truly selfish people in British society these days are the fame-hungry politicians, the tourism quangos and the mostly middle-aged, middle-class panjandrums who seem intent on prolonging this misery for as long as they can. The Victor Meldrews and Hyacinth Buckets of this world who have no plans to leave the house for as much as a 99 Flake.   These 30 million vaccinated individuals seem to forget just how lucky they are. They’re probably the same people currently stood in their mortgage-free gardens holding empty glasses to their neighbour’s fence, in the hope of outing a seventh voice behind the fizz of a cremated sausage.  One in eight Britons doesn’t have access to a garden. Therefore, belittling crowds on beaches, in parks, and on walking trails on the first sunny day of the year says more about you than it does them. Or would you prefer the proles to sculk back into solitary confinement for a few months longer?  Fewer people are now dying each day (from anything) than before the virus even existed. I understand the need to be cautious, but the chances of catching Covid outside are minuscule. The mental health benefits now greatly outweigh the physical risks.  This past year has normalised the constant meddling in other people’s business. But Covid Jobsworths, I hope your days are numbered.  ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/vilifying-crowds-parks-first-sunny-day-year-says-does/
8,,"The EU has said that “zero” AstraZeneca jabs   from a factory in the Netherlands to the UK if the company fails to meet its commitments to the bloc. This is protectionism in tooth and claw. It shamelessly disregards contracts and it also overlooks critical British investment in research and production. Our vaccine success is not only down to staying out of the EU procurement programme and signing contracts early – though both were a stroke of genius. We also spent heavily on research and upscaling production. As we report today, the UK invested more than £21 million to build up capacity at the Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands, before the Oxford vaccine was even proven to work. Moreover, the Dutch government, and by extension the EU, was invited to join the project and secure doses for themselves – but chose not to take part. Unquestionably, this initial expenditure should entitle Britain to its fair share of the jabs made on the site (British engineers also travelled to Halix to improve production over Christmas). The UK has spoken of “sharing” inoculations; it is the EU that is being unreasonable. Europe has paid a heavy price for failure when it comes to immunisation, as signalled by France’s humiliating extension of its lockdown, but the EU’s leadership is determined to paper over the cracks with bullying. Even some of our old Brexit sparring partners are disgusted: Jean-Claude Juncker labelled the trade war “stupid” and Michel Barnier, thought to be a Gaullist rival to Emmanuel Macron, has called for a ceasefire. Mr Barnier spent much of the negotiations lecturing us over the inviolability of the Single Market, giving every impression that its workings were logical and just. But the EU is not about free trade, as this sordid affair proves, but is really a political project, now betraying its authoritarian nature in a moment of self-imposed crisis. The world is watching and can judge the facts. Had the Dutch joined the investment at Halix, they might have been able to reserve jabs for the EU. Instead, the UK signed a contract of first refusal in return for its investment,  fair and square. There are benefits to acting fast and acting strategically, an argument Eurosceptics made often – and for which they were ridiculed by their opponents.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2021/04/01/eus-vaccine-bullying-papers-embarrassing-facts/
9,,"For someone whose passion – and livelihood – is writing about visual art, lockdown has been tough. Art isn’t about scrolling through images on smartphones, but about seeing art in the flesh and being part of a living, breathing public. So once I’ve had a pint in a pub, my next stop on April 12 will be at whichever reopened commercial gallery is nearest.  Public museums and galleries, however, victims of   of “Covid-security”, have to wait until May 17. What awaits us when we get back through their doors will bear the marks of a year unlike any other. Not only have many of our cultural institutions been pushed to the financial edge as visitor numbers have collapsed (the big London museums have seen three-quarters of their visitors disappear), but we’ve witnessed the unravelling, catalysed by the Black Lives Matter movement, of how museums and galleries view themselves and their raison d’être. This, coupled with the pressing need to balance the books, means that when they re-open they’ll be obsessed with one thing: “relevance”. Stripped of tourist footfall and fretting about their ageing demographic, museums will be looking to pull in what crowd there is, and that crowd is going to be young. The V&A’s show   had only just opened in December before the third lockdown, but the pace of bookings showed that pop culture sells museum tickets, and that luxury brand partnerships – the show is sponsored by Mulberry, which has its own section about the making of its exclusive merchandise – aren’t going to go away. There’s nothing more Instagrammable than high fashion, after all. Except, perhaps,   “Infinity Mirror Rooms”, one of the first new offerings at Tate Modern this spring. The Japanese artist’s trippy walk-in environments have long been a queue-round-the-block hit with her huge millennial fanbase – who are a perfect target audience for one of the show’s sponsors, fashion brand Uniqlo. It would be unfair to blame that growing millennial audience for being pandered to by cultural institutions, and it’s too easy to mock some of the more crass hook-ups between august museums and whatever grabs the attention of a distracted social-media-driven crowd– although the National Portrait Gallery’s pre-lockdown display of portraits of characters from The Mandalorian, a Star Wars spin-off TV series, could be hard to beat. But although there’s a trivial side to this obsession with drawing in the “kids” – and to be fair, we’re talking adults in their twenties and thirties here – it’s easy to miss a bigger ideological shift.  Our museums and galleries have been having a kind of cultural nervous breakdown, faced with a growing chorus of disapprobation driven by the tenets of woke millennial orthodoxy. These institutions, so the accusations go, are too full of colonial loot, too white, too male, not diverse enough, beholden to toxic corporate interests. Stung by the rebukes of the audience they’re trying to court, they’ve been rushing to redefine their programmes and ethos. So even though it’s shut for refurbishment until 2023, the National Portrait Gallery could announce in recent weeks that it’s “reimagining its collection”, launching the project Reframing Narratives: Women in Portraiture to enhance the representation of women in the gallery’s collection of predominantly male subjects. We should be proud to live in a culture that rejects sexism and misogyny. But   to fit the preoccupations of the zeitgeist is quickly going to create a dull conformism in museum culture. It’s as if museums had given up on trying to tell the public why we should care about all the strange old stuff in their collections, and instead had decided to find ways of remaining “relevant” to their audience’s existing concerns. As Dr Flavia Frigeri, the director of the NPG’s new initiative, remarked: “We’re celebrating women past and present, with the hopes that one day little girls who visit the gallery will see their portraits and be empowered.” It’s not good enough to find museums fascinating, pleasurable or horizon-expanding: you’re going to be “empowered”, too. And, of course, Reframing Narratives is sponsored by Chanel. Brands are equally keen to be seen responding to the ethical priorities of their visitors, and the “corporate woke” mentality is likely to drive the agendas of cash-strapped cultural institutions for some time. However much one agrees or disagrees with agendas such as these, the first casualty for the post-Covid arts sector will be   to shape their programmes – and do it free of a new orthodoxy of relevance.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/museums-going-corporate-woke-agenda-insidious/
10,Covid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will change,"Lockdown measures   - as part of the roadmap out of lockdown, the stay-at-home rule ended and the rule of six returned in England. These measures are part of the four key steps over four months to bring the UK completely out of lockdown. The plans are an attempt to kick-start the British economy and ease the societal pressures of lockdown without triggering a dangerous resurgence of the virus. The roadmap is underpinned by four key “tests” that are linked to data, which will act like a checklist that must be met before moving onto the next step of reopening. The four tests will determine whether:   is going as planned; vaccines are effective in bringing down deaths and hospitalisations;  are not rising so fast that the NHS risks being overwhelmed;   do not create unforeseen risks. Another big change is the scrapping of tiers, to be replaced with ""steps"".  Step one, part one applied to all of England from March 8, with the second part from  . Regions will enter step two no earlier than Apr 12, and step three no earlier than May 17.   Step four, which will come into force no earlier than Jun 21, should see ""all legal limits on social contact"" lifted.  The Prime Minister said it was thanks to the UK public ""that we can continue on our road map to freedom"". He said: ""We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of a vaccine to every adult by the end of July. It comes as  and deaths from the virus are at the lowest level since October, official figures reveal. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) findings, which on Mar 30  , suggest there is widespread immunity either due to previous infection or  . As of Mar 31, a total of 30,905,538 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with over 4m having received both jabs. Completing inoculation of the nearly 30m Britons between doses is the government's current priority moving forward. The third test has triggered early debate, because rising cases alone will not be enough to stop reopening. That will happen only if rising cases risk overwhelming hospitals. The four steps are separated five weeks apart. That leaves four weeks to monitor the impact of the preceding step and one week to give people notice. The reopening is designed to happen uniformly across England, so there is no return to the tier system. Below are the four steps of the roadmap. The dates are the earliest dates at which the next step could happen, with delays possible if the data takes a negative turn.  The first step, which began on Mar 8, is split into two sections, initially focusing on getting   again and reuniting families who have spent so long kept apart. All schools in England, both primary and secondary, have now reopened, with   in schools and at home.  Pupils are expected to wear face masks in the opening weeks. However, students will not be forced to wear face coverings in classrooms, as some will be ""anxious and nervous"" about wearing them, children's minister Vicky Ford has said.  School sports have also returned, both indoor and outdoor, so pupils of all ages can get back to playing football and doing PE lessons. Schools can set their own rules. ‘Wraparound’ childcare is allowed to resume, which means after school sports and extra curricular clubs can take place.  There were also  on Mar 8. Residents are now allowed to have a single visitor, and that individual can visit repeated times rather than the trip being a one-off. The visitor and care home resident will be allowed to hold hands, but other close contact is not allowed. The visitor must get a Covid-19 test beforehand and wear protective equipment. The outdoor socialising rules have changed in the second section of reopening. From March 29, six people from six different households were allowed to meet outside, meaning the so-called ‘rule of six’ returned. Alternatively, two households could also meet outside. This means two families, who potentially together total more than six people, are allowed to meet. This can happen in both outdoor public spaces and in back gardens.  has been dropped, similarly the Government has dropped its “stay local” messaging, meaning that households are no longer explicitly told to remain in their geographical area.  While people will still be encouraged to minimise travel, there will not be punishments for someone who drives a few hours for a meet-up outside, then returns that day.  Outdoor organised sports for both adults and children will also return. Outdoor swimming pools, driving and shooting ranges, riding arenas at riding centres, archery venues and climbing walls are also allowed to open. So too outdoor gyms. The return of team sports can only happen in formalised settings, meaning that five-a-side football matches are allowed but a dozen friends kicking a ball in a park is not. Indoor sports will still be off limits. Also the sports must be organised, so a large group of people cannot gather to kick around a football if it breaks the number limits explained above.  will be allowed to open from Apr 12, if the data allows. People may be urged to only go in alone rather than as an entire household. Retailers will be as the Government seeks to bolster the high street and ensure compliance with social distancing rules.  However, a tourism industry leader said it was ""extraordinary"" that visitor attractions would be forced to remain closed when non-essential retail opened. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), made the comment as he revealed major UK tourist sites suffered a 70% decline in visitor numbers last year compared with 2019. Mr Donoghue said: ""It's extraordinary to me that you can open Primark and H&M but not the Tate and V&A (Victoria and Albert Museum). Not least because, according to Public Health England, there hasn't been a single case of coronavirus transmission at a visitor attraction in the UK. They've proved to be Covid safe.""  can open again from the same date, but only outside, so pub gardens and outdoor dining will be back. Groups can gather, but with the same limits as above: either up to six people or two households.  There will be no curfews or any requirement to serve a meal with alcohol, removing the  Pubs will be allowed to serve takeaway pints.  Boris Johnson indicated on Mar 24 that   when they reopen later this year. However, Mr Johnson said it may not be feasible to implement the plans until everyone has been offered a vaccine, after publicans criticised his plans. The Prime Minister said on Mar 25 that the Government will say more on their possible use in early April, and suggested they could also be based on whether  , as well as vaccinations and negative tests. Staycations will be allowed, in a limited form. One household will be allowed to stay overnight somewhere in the UK, but not with another household. ‘Self-contained accommodation’ will be available to rent, so for example cottages or Airbnb rentals or campsites. However hotels and B&Bs cannot reopen. Hairdressers and nail salons will be allowed to open.  Outdoor hospitality venues like zoos and theme parks can also open. The limit on the maximum number of attendees at weddings and wakes will also rise from six to 15. There will be no change for funerals, to which 30 attendees are already allowed. Gyms can also open but you cannot attend with people outside of your household, because indoor socialising is barred at this point. Gym classes are not yet allowed. From May 17, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet indoors, so people can enter each other's homes from now.  The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, stated on Feb 23 that  , although people must remain ""cautious"" until this date.  Pubs and restaurants can open indoors. It is unlikely there will be strict requirements on capacity, but it must be table service. Hotels and B&Bs can open in step three,as can indoor sports and gym classes. Entertainment venues can open too, including cinemas and theatres. New rules will be in place for different sizes of venues. Normal outdoor events can open for up to 4,000 people or 50 per cent of the venue capacity, whichever is smaller.  Similarly normal indoor events can open for up to 1,000 people or 50 per cent capacity, again whichever is lower. For huge outdoor seated venues there is a special limit. Up to 10,000 attendees will be allowed or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower.  This means, for example, Wembley Stadium will be able to open with 10,000 fans attending. Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, said that coronavirus ""certificates"", were being considered as a way of getting people back to larger events ""in significant numbers"" from Jun 21. ""We're piloting the different things that will enable that to happen - clearly it will have to be done in a Covid-secure way"", he said. ""You would expect, and we will be testing these things, things like one-way systems, things like masks, things like hand hygiene and everything else. ""Another thing that we are considering is a Covid certification, and we will be testing whether we can use Covid certification to help facilitate the return of sports."" Weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events like Bar mitzvahs and christenings will be allowed to be attended by up to 30 people. This will be as close to normal as possible. There will be no attendance limits on weddings and funerals. Big venues that were unable to open last year, such as nightclubs, can finally reopen. Many of the details for what can happen now is dependent on a number of reviews. There are four reviews that have been commissioned that sit below the roadmap. They are designed to find answers that right now the Government feels it cannot give. Each has a ‘complete by now’ date, meaning we know when to expect clarity but not what the review will decide or if it will lead to a change in the rules. One review is looking at international travel. It will see whether with vaccine certificates and testing the border can be more open than it is now. This must conclude before step three on May 17 but could report back in April. That means - theoretically at least - the borders could be relaxed in time for summer holidays. However there is no guarantee the current rules, which bar anyone from travelling overseas for holiday, will be lifted after the review, meaning summer holidays abroad are not guaranteed. It comes as Boris Johnson confirmed that the UK’s holiday roadmap will be unveiled on April 5. The Government’s Global Travel Taskforce was expected to report on April 12, but at a Government press conference on Mar 28 Mr Johnson confirmed the announcement will be made one week earlier than planned , with further detail to be given on April 12. But many experts have warned that Covid variants  . New regulations that passed with the review of coronavirus restrictions on Mar 25 include a provision to ban leaving the United Kingdom ""without a reasonable excuse"", meaning those leaving the UK without a valid reason could face a £5,000 fine. Exemptions include work, volunteering, studying, elite sports, legal obligations, medical reasons, care and assistance to vulnerable person, wedding of a close family member - but   going on holiday. Matt Hancock confirmed in an interview with   on Mar 23 that this policy will come into force in the week of Mar 28. A second review will look at social distancing measures. These include the keeping of two metres apart outside (or ‘one metre-plus’ inside), wearing face masks and being encouraged to work from home. That review is due to report back before stage four, which is Jun 17. In other words, do not expect to be told to go back to work in an office until the summer at the earliest. A third review will look at Covid vaccine certificates being used domestically. This is interesting as Government ministers had previously played down that possibility.  understands that   could be introduced at theatres, football matches, business conferences, wedding venues and  . The Prime Minister has confirmed that Michael Gove has tasked in  , in which the ""deep and complex issues"" surrounding the introduction of immunity certificates will be examined. Boris Johnson skirted the issue on Mar 24, stating that the use of vaccine passports in pubs may be up to the discretion of individual landlords. It is understood that the Government remains concerned about the implications of such steps and will weigh moral and ethical implications of any moves like this. It will report back by step four, which is Jun 17. The fourth review will look at large events. It will attempt to work out when it is safe for large events to be held again. It too will report back by step four, so Jun 17. Pilots for big outdoor events will be allowed to take place from April.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/covid-lockdown-roadmap-dates-rules-lift-easing-restrictions-extension/
11,"SNP branches are repaying money after wrongly claiming Covid business support, Nicola Sturgeon says","SNP branches who claimed thousands of pounds in Covid business support were wrong and the money will be paid back,   said on Friday. The party has been urged to “come clean” on the number of branches that claimed the support, after two Angus branches were told to pay back £20,000 in help they should not have been given. The Arbroath and Montrose SNP branches each made successful £10,000 business support grant applications to Angus Council last year, but have since been told the rules don’t permit grants to political parties and have been ordered to repay the cash. Alex King, Arbroath West and Letham SNP councillor and branch treasurer, said the rules around the grants initially did not state that political parties weren’t entitled to the support. Speaking to journalists on Friday, the First Minister said she is “not aware” of other branches claiming the lifeline fund and admitted that it would not “be an appropriate use of public money”. “As I understand it the rules weren't broken but the councils have decided that it is not appropriate, and the money in one case has been paid back and in the other case is in the process of being paid back,” she said. “If I thought that it was an appropriate use and in the spirit of the rules around the use of public money it wouldn't be getting paid back.” However, the Tories have demanded that the SNP “come clean” about how much taxpayers’ money was claimed and alleged that local branches were encouraged to “play the system” by “senior nationalists”.  ""If they won't come clean, we may need a police investigation to examine if there has been an attempt at fraud here,” said Maurice Golden, the Conservative candidate for Angus South. ""This cash was designed to help honest businesses through a global pandemic which has cost thousands of lives in Scotland. Instead, the nationalists used it to line the pockets of their own selfish cause."" Hitting back, Ms Sturgeon said that ten Conservative branches in England have also claimed the support money, adding that the Tory position is “somewhat hypocritical”. “I don't know, perhaps, you know, somebody wants to ask Douglas Ross when he is commenting on the SNP whether that's all being paid back or not,"" she said.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/02/snp-branches-repaying-money-wrongly-claiming-covid-business/

France, Spain and Italy wanted the biggest stick to wave at Britain possible, while Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands were worried about triggering a vaccine trade war.  Britain exports raw materials to the Pfizer factory in EU member Belgium, which could be at risk if the EU blocked vaccine supplies to the UK.  The European Council was too divided to agree to explicitly support the new rules in their summit conclusions.  This makes little difference legally because the rules had already entered into force through a commission implementing regulation. It could be quashed by EU member states over the next fortnight but it won’t be. It is politically significant. Mrs von der Leyen (below) will think twice without the support of her masters in the Council and they have made clear she is not to put supply chains at risk.  Mark Rutte of the Netherlands said he hoped the new rules would never be used.  The gun on the table may not have a full chamber but it is still loaded.  AstraZeneca, which Brussels accuses of breaking its supply contract with the EU, and by extension Britain is not off the hook.  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Mrs von der Leyen were clear.  “Companies have to honour their contract to the European Union before they export to other regions in the world. And this is of course the case with AstraZeneca,” said Mrs von der Leyen, before adding the firm would have to “catch up” before it could export outside the EU. The commission has already threatened to block shipments of the Oxford University jab to the UK from AstraZeneca’s Halix plant in the Netherlands.  It wants Boris Johnson to drop the British first refusal on jabs manufactured in the two UK AstraZeneca plants so they can begin supplying the EU, which is foreseen in Brussels’ contract with the pharma giant.  Brussels says this is a matter of fairness because EU-based factories have exported so many vaccines to the UK. UK-EU negotiations are underway and will continue in the coming days.  The EU’s gun may not be quite as large as Mrs von der Leyen would have liked but it could still blow a hole in Britain’s vaccination rollout.  The commission has briefed member states that Britain is hugely dependent on EU supplies for the second phase of its vaccination programme.  Since December, Pfizer has sent the UK 20m doses. A further 1m came from AstraZeneca.  Just under 29m people have had their first jab in Britain. That suggests about 8m jabs in the UK were made in Britain or imported from suppliers outside the EU, which is by no means enough to fill a continental sized hole in imports.  The UK will struggle to vaccinate the rest of its population  , ensuring they are fully vaccinated, without EU supplies.  About 2.5m are fully vaccinated with a second dose, leaving about 26m people at risk of not being fully inoculated against coronavirus.  France’s foreign minister held up the EU’s gun this morning. He said the UK’s first dose policy, in which as many people were jabbed as quickly as possible meant there were no stockpiles reserved for second shots.  Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's foreign minister, said “Europe does not have to pay the price for this policy.” The UK-EU talks are the first since Britain left the transition period to not directly concern Brexit.  EU leaders have made clear their preference is for a deal rather than a trade war.  Unless the UK has a secret second shot stockpile stashed away somewhere, Boris Johnson may be forced to to find the least embarrassing way to give the EU what it wants.  That is likely to be an agreement to share supplies from the Halix factory and possibly, at a later date, from the two British-based factories as well.  That compromise will be far simpler to swallow once more and more people are vaccinated and more supplies come on stream in the coming months.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/eu-still-has-gun-table-wont-pull-trigger/
13,Exclusive: Britain to tell Brussels AstraZeneca jab would not exist without UK investment,"Britain will this week tell the European Union that it must take into account the millions of pounds spent by British taxpayers on creating the AstraZeneca vaccine as   remains. Talks to break the stand-off over jabs  , will resume as early as Monday.   The European Commission has threatened to   because British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has fallen far short of its contracted deliveries to the bloc.   Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, last week   after she disclosed that factories in the EU had sent 21 million jabs to the UK since December but received none in return.   The UK-EU negotiations will focus on defining what ""reciprocity"" means, whether it would include finished vaccines or their ingredients and whether and how a deal would take into account investment in vaccine development.   British officials will argue that the EU has benefited from £84 million in funding for the manufacturing for the AstraZeneca jab, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. Without this cash, the UK will say, there would be no vaccine at all.   The UK is pushing for Britain's per capita investment to be part of the calculations because it is a single country rather than the 27 member states of the bloc and so has proportionately invested more than some individual EU nations. According to the Government's recent spending review, it has paid more than £6 billion in total to develop and procure Covid vaccines.   The UK also exports raw materials to the Pfizer vaccine plant in Belgium. It plans significant increases in research and development, with almost £15 billion in 2021-22 including funding for clinical research to support delivery of new drugs, treatments and vaccines. Maros Sefcovic, the commission vice-president, told The Telegraph that investment in development would be one of the factors taken into consideration when evaluating reciprocity. The commission does not see reciprocity as being based on a simple dose-for-dose formula, not least because it is a major manufacturing hub for the jab. One diplomat said he was not surprised by the British demand, saying it ""seemed fair"". But the source warned that the EU would also want German investment in the development of the Pfizer jab to be taken into account.  ""And how do we subtract the European investment in Halix? And the advance purchase agreement of the EU for the production of AstraZeneca vaccines that never came about?"" the diplomat said.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/27/exclusive-britain-tell-brussels-astrazeneca-jab-would-not-exist/
14,,"Less than two months ago, in its last Monetary Policy Committee report, the Bank of England forecast that the UK economy would shrink a further 4 per cent in the first quarter of this year. It looked a reasonable enough prediction, given renewed lockdown of at that stage indeterminate length. At the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, they were more pessimistic still. In early December, the OECD warned that recovery from the pandemic would be slower in the UK than any other major economy bar Argentina, with GDP still 6 per cent smaller by the end of this year than its pre-pandemic level. Fortunately, it is not turning out that way, so much so that it is now entirely plausible that the first quarter of this year could be in positive territory, or only a little down on the preceding three months. In view of where we were, that would be a remarkable outcome. For it wasn’t just another national lockdown the economy has had to contend with; there were also the disruptions of Brexit, which have hammered exports to the Continent.  Even so, the OECD could scarcely have been more wrong.  . Instead, the supposed tortoise has turned into a hare, such that it seems entirely possible the economy will be back to pre-pandemic levels of activity by the late summer, leaving European neighbours trailing in its wake. . Mobility data, together with anecdotal evidence, suggests that even before the restrictions began to be eased, lockdown rules were being widely flouted. Try as the Government has to persuade us that we are not yet out of the woods, rapid vaccine rollout has generated a widespread sense of release. This may be unwarranted, but it is already observable in freer economic behaviour. More importantly, however, the economy has just got a whole lot better at coping with lockdown. Forecasters hugely underestimated our ability to adapt. Forms of economic activity that seemed impossible a year ago now take place with relative ease. It is only really the hospitality, non essential retail, travel and events sectors that continue to be heavily impacted. There has, moreover, been a degree of compensating growth elsewhere in the economy – surging online sales and more home consumption being only the most obvious manifestations. In any case, the narrative has shifted in a way that even a few months ago could not have been predicted. Here are six catchall reasons for confidence in the future. One. Fast declining Covid hospitalisation and death rates make it all but inconceivable that the timetable for lifting lockdown restrictions will not be met. With the possible exception of overseas travel, the economy should be operating normally again by late June, with the removal of all legal limits on social contact. Vaccine resistant variants could puncture this certainty, but for now we have seen no evidence of them. Two. The Chancellor has extended income support from April to September, which greatly mitigates the expected spike in unemployment that would have occurred when furlough came to an end. Astonishingly, given the worst economic downturn in more than 300 years, unemployment looks as if it will peak at little more than 6 per cent. The Government has seemingly done a good job at preventing wider economic scarring. Three. At least some part of the excess in savings built up during more than a year of on/off lockdown will get spent in the years ahead. This will temporarily add rocket boosters to returning levels of demand. Already we see evidence of it in buoyant house sales, holiday bookings and restaurant reservations. Four. Just as the very un-European way in which we measure public sector activity deepened the recorded size of the downturn going into the pandemic, the reverse effect comes into play as we come out. A seemingly bigger contraction is met by a sharper rebound. The vaccine programme adds further welly to public sector output. Five. The inventory cycle – accumulation of stocks followed by their depletion – used to play a big part in the wider ups and downs of the economy, but has been made all but redundant in recent decades by just-in-time supply chains. A combination of Brexit, lockdown and the Suez canal blockage may temporarily have brought it back into play. Inventories have been run down to historic lows, indicating an urgent need to rebuild, which will in turn further boost economic activity. Six. A veritable boom in investment spending can be anticipated over the next two years as businesses seek to take advantage of “super-deductions” announced in the Budget. With firms attempting to beat the higher corporation tax rate in two years’ time, the effect is only to steal investment spending from the future. Yet for a while, the new tax regime promises to turbocharge business investment. Mix it all together, and some kind of mini-boom is in prospect, albeit one coloured by deep structural change, negative as well as positive. Happy Easter.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/get-ready-britains-post-pandemic-boom/
15,Special report: Sturgeon clings to tarnished crown after inquiries ‘lift lid on the sewer’ of SNP politics,"“It’s very clear that Nicola Sturgeon is damaged goods and her days are numbered. She is by no means off the hook.” The sort of verdict you might expect from a flag-waving Unionist at the end of a tempestuous week for the Scottish National Party. Except that those words were spoken by a former deputy leader of the SNP itself, even before Alex Salmond’s The jubilation among the First Minister’s supporters after she survived two inquiries into her role in the Alex Salmond affair lasted all of three days before Mr Salmond pulled back the tarpaulin on his ultimate vengeance weapon, the Alba Party, which threatens to blow up the SNP’s chances of a Holyrood majority in the May 6 elections. If the SNP – currently a minority government – achieves an overall majority, the party’s plans to force a second independence referendum will be rapidly accelerated. There is a growing belief within the SNP, however, that the party will fall short of the mark, and that if “IndyRef2” does happen, it might not be with Ms Sturgeon at the helm. The SNP’s poll rating peaked at 58 per cent last autumn, and stayed above 50 per cent for the whole of last year, putting the party on course for a majority,   according to a recent Opinium poll, suggesting the controversy has taken its toll. The twin inquiries into the SNP’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations made against former leader Mr Salmond have exposed to public view the toxic civil war between the Sturgeonites and the Salmondites, like a manhole cover being lifted off a sewer. Mr Salmond now intends to go another round with Ms Sturgeon in a fresh court case that could reveal damaging details suppressed in the inquiries. Then, at 2pm on Friday, came that Mr Salmond is to lead a new party into the elections. Its aim, he claims, is to achieve a “supermajority” for independence in the Scottish parliament, but its effect is more likely to be splitting the vote between the SNP and Alba (the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland). Mr Salmond said on Friday that Alba was “planting our saltire on a hill” and that “in the next few weeks we shall see how many will rally to our standard”. In truth, he is parking his tanks on Ms Sturgeon’s lawn, driving a wedge into the split that already exists in the SNP, and calling on its members, MPs and MSPs to defect to his side. If he is elected to Holyrood, it will be the start of an all-out war between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond for the leadership, and the future, of Scotland.   Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader of the SNP, said: “I was a long-term critic of Alex Salmond when he led the SNP, and he of me. I take back not a word, and I expect him to be the same. “But Brexit, the pandemic, the failures of the SNP, the embarrassing stark lack of quality in its ranks in Holyrood, means we are in a new situation when old grievances need to be set aside. I welcome his return to frontline politics.” He added: “People have seen a face of the Scottish government that is unacceptable. People are not stupid. They know the government has misbehaved and engaged in a gross misuse of power. “This government is politically corrupt and the tentacles of political corruption have spread to institutions in civic society.” One serving SNP MP admitted: “Nicola’s brand has been tarnished. I think this will have an impact at the polls because people have seen the in-fighting and the rage.” For those who have not followed the labyrinthine progress of the Salmond affair, the basic facts are these: in 2018, details were leaked to a Scottish newspaper of sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Salmond, dating to 2013 when he was first minister. Mr Salmond denied the claims, accused the Scottish government of an abuse of process in its handling of the claims, and won a 2019 court case against the government, which had to pay him more than £500,000 for legal expenses. Weeks after winning the court case, Mr Salmond was charged by police with sexually assaulting nine women while he was first minister. He was cleared of 12 charges at a trial last year, the jury finding the 13th charge “not proven”. Mr Salmond accused members of the Sturgeon administration of by encouraging women to make complaints against him, which the SNP has always denied. He claimed Ms Sturgeon had known about the allegations for longer than she had admitted, and had lied to the Scottish Parliament about when she found out, a resignation matter if true. An independent inquiry by Irish barrister James Hamilton  though a committee of MSPs found  At the heart of the problem with Scottish politics is what Mr Sillars terms a “cult of personality” that began with Mr Salmond and was continued by Ms Sturgeon when she took over as SNP leader following defeat for the independence campaign in 2014’s “once in a generation” referendum. The SNP has not had a leadership election since 2004, such has been the dominance of Salmond and his former protege, but as one long-standing SNP member complained: “Any political party should be much bigger than one figure, because people always turn out to have feet of clay.” A cult is the opposite of a democracy, and the charge sheet of undemocratic behaviour by the SNP is growing. The party’s opponents cite the role of the Crown Office, the equivalent of England’s Crown Prosecution Service, which was able to  – over the two inquiries. In most democracies, the principle of the separation of powers means that prosecutors and politicians operate independently, as with England’s director of public prosecutions. But in Scotland, the Crown Office is headed by the Lord Advocate, who is also a member of the Cabinet, meaning the person who ultimately decides who does and does not face prosecution is a politician loyal to Ms Sturgeon (currently James Wolffe). As the former Brexit secretary “that leaves him conflicted and compromised, with his department’s independence undermined”. When the two inquiries’ reports were published this week, large sections were redacted on the orders of the Crown Office; Mr Hamilton himself complained that the redactions meant his own report “presents an incomplete and even at times misleading version of what happened”. Evidence given by Mr Salmond was redacted to protect the identities of complainants, according to the Crown Office, but Mr Davis, and others, have claimed the redactions did not identify the women and were designed only to protect Ms Sturgeon. Meanwhile, the somewhat toothless committee of MSPs which carried out the parliamentary inquiry complained that key evidence it requested from the Scottish government arrived with widespread redactions, with some documents “almost completely blank” and others with “pages and pages of fully redacted text”. The committee complained: “We did not know the basis on which redactions were being made.” Mr Salmond, ominously for Ms Sturgeon, has a plan to get that evidence out in the open. On Wednesday, he announced his intention to sue the Scottish government’s Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom he blamed for “catastrophic failures in this matter”. He pointed out that the courts would have “all the proper powers of recovery of documents” which the parliamentary committee lacked, and friends of Mr Salmond have confirmed that he believes those documents will implicate Ms Sturgeon’s office in what he sees as a conspiracy against him. He has also made a complaint to Police Scotland about the leaking of a story about the complaints against him in 2018, which could further embarrass the SNP if it proves to have come from someone close to Ms Sturgeon. “This could go on for a long time and could yet bring Nicola down,” admitted a senior SNP source. Amid the fevered anticipation of the inquiry reports, another potential time-bomb for Ms Sturgeon went largely unnoticed last weekend. Three members of the SNP’s Finance and Audit Committee resigned, reportedly because they had been denied full access to the party’s books by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, also known as the husband of Nicola Sturgeon. One of the departees, Cynthia Guthrie, was announced yesterday as an Alba Party candidate. The SNP has not reported or even confirmed the resignations, let alone the reasons for them, and party sources have told The Telegraph they are “having a hard time” getting to the bottom of the matter. Questions about management of the SNP’s finances are not new: the party raised £600,000 for a second referendum campaign which it claimed was “ringfenced”, but only had £97,000 in the bank in its most recent accounts, and members now report being asked for more donations for a referendum “fighting fund”. A spokesman for the SNP said three people had resigned from its finance and audit committee following concerns about leaks to the media, and denied Mr Murrell had failed to provide access to the accounts.  It said the £600,000 raised for a referendum “is allocated to our 2021 budget and will be spent in this financial year”. Despite the whiff of scandal that has hung over Auld Reekie for the past three years, relatively few public figures have dared to speak out against the SNP, such is   its power and electoral dominance have engendered north of the border. Jack Perry CBE, the former chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national innovation and investment agency, has witnessed it at first hand. “The SNP party machine is good at intimidation,” he said. “It’s implicit that if you oppose them or offend them, you won’t get much business in the future. I have been at business events where every single firm is anti-independence but when an SNP minister turns up not a single person challenges them because they are afraid to.” Glasgow-based Barrhead Travel from nationalists when it backed the No campaign in the independence referendum.  when it branded its teacakes “British” rather than Scottish south of the border. Other businesses have learnt to keep quiet for fear of a fight with the so-called “cybernats” who launch attacks via social media. Earlier this week, it emerged that former Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, not normally regarded as a shrinking violet,  in the 2014 referendum because “the people putting their heads above the parapet were getting shot at”, according to Alistair Campbell’s latest diaries. Sir Alex feared “dog’s abuse” for standing up for the Union, in which he is a passionate believer. Scots rely far more heavily on their government for employment than the English: the public sector accounts for 21.8 per cent of jobs in Scotland, compared with 16.4 per cent in England, meaning “a lot of private companies are reliant on public sector contracts”, Mr Perry said. He added that quangos which were once headed by independent-minded patrons ready to challenge the government and improve policy were now all too often populated with unquestioning SNP supporters. Even the education of Scotland’s children is up for grabs when it comes to promoting the nationalist cause, critics say. In December, Education Scotland finally withdrew a timeline of Scottish history after Sir Tom Devine, the country’s leading historian, Among its false claims was that Sir Winston Churchill “dispatched English troops and tanks” to stamp out a major protest by striking workers in Glasgow in 1919 while locking up Scottish soldiers in barracks. Other errors included a suggestion that Flower of Scotland – written in the 1960s – dated as far back as the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Academics had raised the alarm almost two years before the timeline – “clearly designed in the cause of Scottish independence”, according to one history professor – was eventually removed. Nor is the supposedly politically neutral civil service immune from the SNP’s iron grip. A taxpayer-funded Scottish Government video released at new year described the Brexit trade deal as “a bad deal for Scotland” that would cause “greater risk to national security”, prompting accusations that the civil service was While the SNP is ruthless in targeting its opponents, it reserves its most sinister threats for those within its ranks.  Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, was  last month following a row over transgender law reform (Ms Cherry QC believes the SNP is going too far in simplifying the legal process for changing gender). She later revealed she had been subjected to “an 18-month campaign of abuse” culminating with “a threat of corrective rape from a party member”. Other SNP members had bombarded her with abuse, calling her a **** , while friends said she had been subjected to “bullying, lies and smears” from her colleagues. “It has become an anti-free speech party,” said one Sturgeon critic within the SNP. “Anyone who dares to depart from the party line and suggest new ideas is pretty much crushed.” Fraser Nelson, the editor of The Spectator and a proud Scot, has also faced apparent attempts to intimidate him after his magazine went to court to fight for the right to publish Alex Salmond’s evidence in full (opposed, inevitably, by the Crown Office). Trisha Marwick, the former presiding officer (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament tweeted: “We see you Fraser,” with sinister overtones of “we know where you live”. Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ""Sturgeon is clearly suffering from hubris. She is not out of the woods. Neither she nor any other person has been held to account for this litany of scandals. “Most people are rightly repulsed by this unedifying feud and her scorched earth approach has undermined public faith in Scotland's parliament.” As a senior member of the SNP told The Telegraph: “If I didn’t depend on the SNP for my employment, I would have cut up my membership card by now.” A recent survey found that only 8 per cent of Scots rank independence as one of the top three most important issues ahead of the May elections, with Covid recovery, jobs and healthcare their more pressing concerns. For Ms Sturgeon, independence is a useful megaphone to drown out any discussion of her failures, which are numerous. Under her watch educational attainment is down; drug-related deaths have more than doubled (to three and a half times the rate for England, and by far the worst in Europe); life expectancy has decreased in some areas, and even before Covid, Scotland was running a   than the rest of the UK. The SNP also has no answers to key questions around what an independent Scotland would look like –   whether it would have its own armed forces, how it would pay its way without its current subsidies from Westminster – with one SNP MP blaming “intellectual laziness” within the party for its failure to come up with a plan. Despite such failings, after 14 years in power, the SNP seems certain to be the largest party yet again on May 6, either with a majority (for which just four more seats out of 129 are needed) or as a minority government backed by the pro-independence Greens. It will leave the SNP defying political gravity by retaining power for at least 18 years by the time of the 2025 election, a record matched only by the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major era. What then? Ironically, the issue of independence is likely to present a threat to Ms Sturgeon from within her party. She will face significant pressure from the radical wing of her party to call an indicative referendum straight away (which would not be legally binding without consent from Westminster), capitalising on Boris Johnson’s unpopularity in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, however, is by nature more cautious, preferring to build support for independence until the polls suggest a virtually guaranteed win, which at the moment they do not. Were Ms Sturgeon to succumb to activists’ wishes for a quick referendum but fail to win it, she would lose not only the leadership, but very possibly her hopes of breaking up the Union for decades to come. Whether she even gets to make that choice could yet be in the hands of Mr Salmond.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/special-report-sturgeon-clings-tarnished-crown-inquiries-lift/

The National is the highlight of Aintree's Grand National meeting which this year runs from Thursday April 8 to Saturday April 10.

18,Where to find seeds and plants when they've all sold out,"One of the reasons I keep gardening, even on the cold, drizzly days, is because much of it feels like a small, everyday magic trick. Leaves emerging from the dry husk of a clematis vine; seed leaves popping up from a tray at the very moment you’d given up on them; turning soil that was largely rubble six months ago to find it teeming with worms. These are among the tiny discoveries I am making daily in the garden. I’m particularly wide-eyed because, after seven springs of gardening in the box-like confines of balconies attached to flats in South London, I have finally been granted ground of my own. Ground as in the thing we stand on, the surface of the Earth. In my case, loam pretending to be clay, with more than the occasional lump of broken glass, on the Brixton-Camberwell borders. Balcony or windowbox, back garden or estate, I’ve long thought the greatest gardening magic trick is that of time-travel. We stand there in the fading light of November and dream of spring. While everyone else is sunning themselves in the heat of August, we’re fretting about October. Penelope Lively calls it “the gardening eye, the eye that notices what grows”, and claims that “you either have it or you don’t”. As someone who is both physically quite blind and only came to acknowledge plants – and the value of tending to them – in my mid-20s, I’m not sure it’s as absolute as that. But there’s certainly something to be said for the ability to visualise what your growing space will be doing in six months, or a year, or a decade. It’s why we plant trees. I think it’s this same foresight that saw me buy bare-root peonies the minute we knew we’d be moving house, in mid-July, even though you don’t really want to plant them until October. The “gardening eye” was responsible for my October dahlia order, knowing they wouldn’t arrive until July (already potted on and growing – I don’t trust the slugs to plant tubers alone). Tulips were ordered in August, three months before I put the bulbs in the ground. I am a maniacal planner with undeniable Virgo energy, it’s true, but I’ve also learned the hard way: those with the gardening eye strike early, and if you don’t join in, you’ll be left with all the ugly plants. Even the supermarkets will be out of bulbs in October, when you’ll want to plant them, the savvy among us having swooped upon those bargain Narcissus ‘Thalia’ during late summer. Those who came to gardening for the first time in last year’s lockdown also had this rude awakening while lingering in online queues for seed websites. Multipurpose compost was as hard to come by as flour or eggs. Although I scoffed when I saw, in early March, a gardening friend ask who was stockpiling what for the spring ahead; within weeks I was cajoling my local nurseryman to drop off whatever he had without peat during the busiest delivery days he’d seen in years. I have learned from my mistake: 120 litres of potting compost landed on the doorstep in mid-March ( , which is made in the Lake District from wool, without a whiff of peat, and has remarkable water-retention capabilities). Perhaps it’s a pandemic hangover, but the race for gardening supplies seems even more frantic this year. I noticed that supermarket seed racks had been stripped bare back in February. Around the same time, Monty Don told me that seed growers were warning of shortages and demand was outstripping supply. I had placed my orders back in the depths of December (hungry for colour and delirious with the notion of a cancelled Christmas – what arrived in January was a bundle of mostly nicotiana and nasturtiums in a palette ranging from coral to peach), and felt quite smug about this. But I’ll inevitably be caught out when I want to sow courgettes in May and won’t be able to find a packet for love nor money. And it’s not just seeds. The other weekend the BBC were reporting that a savage combination of people anticipating a spring of garden entertaining and shipping delays has created an almighty shortage of garden furniture. I tried to buy some pots online (at  , who make large, surprisingly tasteful terracotta tubs for less than £20) around the same time and found them all out of stock. What to do? Well, not panic, for one. Good gardeners are resourceful, if nothing else. Start by assessing what you’ve got. Seed packets, I feel, have an uncanny ability to multiply while not being watched; there will be something stashed away that you’ve not sown yet. Failing that, the past year has seen a pleasing rise in popularity of seed swapping: broadcaster Emma Real-Davies has initiated one through Instagram which has struck a chord with millennials. Try searching online for a local group, and if that fails,   has advice on how to set up your own. If that all feels too official, try launching a WhatsApp group of gardening-inclined friends and keep it low-key. Share and swap what seeds you’ve got spare, with the added novelty of ending up with something you’d never otherwise plant. It’s how I’ve ended up with a new variety of dwarf peas in one of my containers this spring. Social media has radically improved getting hold of excess plants grown locally –   is a treasure trove of bargain houseplants that owners have got bored of, and as the weather warms up, you can expect to see more outdoor plants popping up. The algorithm, somewhat depressingly, helps here: a semi-regular check on the gardening and outdoors section will encourage the website to offer up more of the same next time you look. It’s worth checking out the other items they have on sale, too – chances are, if someone is selling off chilli seedlings or astilbe divisions, there will be more of other varieties where that came from. Finally, lean into that gardening eye and plan for future seasons now. Having planted – at a guess – 500-odd bulbs into this barren wasteland of a garden last year, it’s been intriguing to see what’s popped up with spring. As ever, there were too few Iris in pots and 75   proved not enough to compensate for squirrel-mining activities. Both of these have gone on a “bulbs to buy this year” note in my iPhone, along with a few varieties spied through Instagram that I’d like to try – the ethereal-looking Narcissus ‘Arctic Bells’ and gothic widow iris among them. Nurseries can expect my orders in August, placed with a cool drink in hand and a vision of the autumn to come. Search for “#seedswap” and filter by “latest” for the most recent results. Advance search will allow you to narrow down your search area if you’re after something closer to home. Tap the save icon on the bottom left of the image. I keep an album specifically for plants I’d like to grow in my saved images, which I refer to when making orders. Join local and horticultural groups to see who might have things to spare. Facebook Marketplace can be a haven of bargain plants, seedlings and other accessories (Genuine anecdotal examples include free slate tiles and a £20 shed) but those who check regularly will get the best finds.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/how-to-grow/find-seeds-plants-sold/
19,"Tour of Flanders 2021: When is the Ronde, what TV channel is it on and which teams and riders are racing?","Set up in 1913 by journalist Karel Van Wijnendaele, the Tour of Flanders — or   as the locals say — is the biggest day in the Belgian sporting calendar and has been described as being like the Boat Race, Royal Ascot and the FA Cup final. All rolled into one. The race itself, the second of the season's five monuments following Mila-Sanremo, originally departed from Ghent, the spiritual home of Belgian cycling, though over the years its route has changed. In an effort to discourage spectators heading to the race due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, organisers have not released a map or profile. The fifth, final and most prestigious race of Flemish Week is on Sunday April 4, 2021. The 105th edition of the Tour of Flanders is 263.7 kilometres long. Those lucky enough to have subscriptions can watch the action on Eurosport or GCN Race Pass. If you cannot watch the race on TV — or your smartphone — then you can follow the action here, so   and return on the day of the race and follow it with us.  . The winner will trouser a cheque to the value of €20,000 while the second-placed rider gets €10,000 and the rider on the third step of the podium €5,000. Each rider in the top 20 will take home something. With the Tour of Flanders being a WorldTour race, there will also be points on offer that will go towards a riders' overall rankings . . .  Until race organisers have released the provisional list of starters,   will keep you up to speed with which riders from each team are expected to feature.

20,Rose Ladies Series to return - with bigger and better format,"So much for the Rose Ladies Series being an emergency one-off. Not only is it returning to the calendar in 2021, but doing so in a bigger and better format. Set up by Justin Rose, England’s Olympic champion, and his wife Kate last year  , the pair have once again stepped up to the mark to complete the gaps in the Ladies European Tour schedule. Running in three blocks from the end of April until the start of September, there are 11 one-day events - three more than in 2020 - with increased prize money.  The first 10 of the 18-hole shootouts will see the winner walk away with £10,000 - double the amount of 2020 - while the final will feature a £20,000 first prize. The quality of courses will also elevate the mini-circuit with links classics such as Hillside and Royal Birkdale playing hosts.  The latter, of course, was where Rose chipped in the 18th as a 17-year-old amateur to come fourth in the 1998 Open Championship. It is remarkable that a germ of an idea   merely to give somewhere for the UK’s stricken female professionals to play, has grown into a series attracting blue-chip sponsors in an area of British sport where none was supposed to exist. That says everything about Rose, the former world No 1, breaking the mould of the modern male pro in putting his name, fame and indeed his money behind an initiative to assist his female counterparts. American Golf and Computacenter return, while the R&A and BMW have also signed up as backers. Excel, the management company which oversees Rose’s career as well as that of Tiger Woods, will act as promoters, with Rose quick to credit the efforts of Paul McDonnell, his long-time handler, and Molly Bullard, the tournament director. ""It’s great that we’ve been able to put this all together and as ever there’s always so many to thank,"" Rose told  . ""These obviously include the female players themselves, as they were the ones which made the series such a hit.  ""When you have pros with the profile of Charley [Hull, the series winner] and Georgia [Hall] competing, it clearly ramps up the status and, thus, interest. You know, after last year’s series, Kate and I were asked  if it would be revived in 2021, but our view was that it would be brilliant if it didn’t have to be and that there would be ample opportunity anyway for these players.  ""Yet while the Ladies European Tour schedule is excellent and bodes so well for the future there are still gaps and that is where we come in. So the first quartet [West Lancs on Apr 29, Woburn on May 6, Brockenhurst Manor on May 13 and The Berkshire on May 21] will give the women the chance to hone their games before the LET begins in earnest.  ""And then there will be the break, until the next four [Hillside on Aug 2, Birkdale on Aug 3, JCB GCC on Aug 5 and Scotscraig on Aug 7] leads them into two big weeks at the Trust Golf Women’s Scottish Open and the AIG Women’s Open. And then the concluding three [Northants on Sept 23, the Buckinghamshire on Sept 23 and Bearwood Lakes on Sept 25] will funnel into the LET’s final stretch.  ""The increase in prize money will concentrate the minds still further and I’ve always said you can’t beat the experience of having a card in your hand. As much as my schedule allows, I’ll be in attendance, especially as these courses are very close to my heart. There is Birkdale, my home course of North Hants and Scotscraig, our first event in Scotland, where I tried to qualify for the Open as a 14-year-old. It’s great for all the clubs and their memberships to give up their courses for a day, particularly after the lockdown closures."" For her part - and   as a former international gymnast with a desire to give the female game the exposure it deserves - Kate Rose is already counting down the days. ""In golf terms, the series was one of the great positives of the British summer in 2020,"" she said. ""We can’t wait.""",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2021/04/01/rose-ladies-series-return-in-bigger-better-format/
21,"Exclusive: Jockey Club faces claims of ‘racism, sexism and bullying’","Employees at the Jockey Club have complained about misogyny, racism and bullying, The Telegraph can disclose. Staff working for the organisation – which has  and government ministers – have accused colleagues of making racist comments and behaving inappropriately. The Jockey Club, which runs 15 racecourses including Aintree, where the  is understood to have faced one allegation of sexual harassment against a senior figure connected to the company, although this was dismissed following an internal investigation. Baroness Harding,  sits on its board and it is likely she will now face questions about whether she and other board members were aware of the complaints. Documents seen by The Telegraph also reveal that an employee complained about racially offensive language used by a manager, including the word “P---”. It is understood that the employee who allegedly made the comments denied making them when he was spoken to by executives. Last night, the Jockey Club said that out of its 600 employees, “historically an average of two to three complaints a year are lodged with the HR department through the official grievance procedures” and that concerns were taken “seriously”. The disclosure is nevertheless likely to raise questions about the culture of horse racing in Britain. Earlier this year, it emerged that one of the country’s most successful female jockeys had complained about being bullied after an incident in the weighing room following a race. The British Horseracing Authority, which regulates the industry, opened an investigation last year after receiving the complaint, which was made about another rider. When details of the alleged incident emerged, questions were raised about whether the sport needed to reform, amid accusations of sexism. The Jockey Club, which runs most of the country’s high-profile racecourses, recorded revenues of more than £200 million A presentation, which was circulated to the board in December 2019, highlights steps the Jockey Club has taken to support diversity. However, a section called “where we were”, reveals how the company had faced “a number of grievances and investigations into allegations of sexist, racist, homophobic and/or bullying behaviour” in 2017-18. It also highlights a “specific grievance that named senior managers, committee members and external partners, which would have been very bad PR if it had gone to tribunal”. It is understood this refers to the sexual harassment and bullying claim made by a woman working for the Jockey Club in 2018. It continued that “on investigation there was no evidence to support the majority of the specific allegations” but there was “a clear need for education and training”. The document also said there had been “evidence that in some teams people were using language and making jokes that were inappropriate”, adding that there had been “strong anecdotal evidence to suggest LGBTQ+ employees were unwilling to ‘come out’ for fear of impact on their career”.  Reporters interviewed more than two dozen employees and found that many said they had made allegations of inappropriate behaviour and others had witnessed alleged incidents. The Telegraph is also aware of several employees who made allegations of bullying by senior managers at the Jockey Club. A male former employee had also raised a formal grievance over alleged bullying and racism by a manager. The member of staff – whom The Telegraph is not naming for legal reasons – said that the manager allegedly used the word “P---” in front of employees and made derogatory remarks about guests at Asian weddings. Former staff have told The Telegraph that they witnessed these comments being made, and that the man also made comments that staff should be wary of catching “Ebola” from black people. The manager who allegedly made the racist remarks is said to have shouted and sworn at staff, as well as making offensive remarks about their appearance, including calling them spotty or fat. After receiving the complaint, the Jockey Club told the employee that a formal investigation “was not the best approach” at the time, because interviewing the witnesses “could be very disruptive to team morale”. The man who made the complaint told The Telegraph that he felt “let down” by the Jockey Club. Accusations about “inappropriate” comments have also been made, when a woman raised concerns in her “exit” interview that a male manager behaved inappropriately and called women who worked for him “sexy”. The Telegraph has spoken to two women who confirmed the allegations. A former employee familiar with the complaint said that the woman felt the comments made by the manager were “disgusting”. “Lots of the women working for him were considerably younger than him and it made people very uncomfortable”, they said. The Telegraph has also established that two women, based in the North West, submitted grievances accusing their managers of bullying. A spokesman for the Jockey Club said that they “take the welfare and well-being of our staff extremely seriously” and that “no form of intolerance or inappropriate behaviour is acceptable at the Jockey Club. “Today, a huge amount of work goes into creating a positive environment for our people to thrive in, regardless of their background, gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation, and we are proud of our supportive culture. “Complaints were investigated and then acted on in accordance with our published grievance policy, with outcomes ranging from complaints not being upheld through to disciplinary action being taken. We keep our policies under review. Should anyone’s behaviour fall short of the high standards we set for ourselves, we will take appropriate steps”. The Jockey Club said that the company was “full of talented and hardworking women and men who make a difference to the British racing industry” and that the “most recent employee survey confirms that the vast majority of employees feel valued and are proud of working for the organisation”. The spokesman said that they “regularly renew our Investors in People accreditation, which is a robust independent assessment process involving employee feedback”.  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/exclusive-jockey-club-faces-claims-racism-sexism-bullying/
22,New questions for British Cycling over Richard Freeman,"British Cycling is facing scrutiny over a leaked email suggesting   asked for monthly rider test data to identify and defend potential doping breaches. The former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor wrote to senior officials that obtaining athlete biological data was “an opportunity to assess frequency of testing and give warning of target testing.” Allegations surrounding the central figure in record Olympic medal hauls come a fortnight after he was struck off the medical register following a tribunal ruling that he ordered testosterone in May 2011 “knowing or believing” it was for doping. A representative for Freeman, who is understood to be looking at whether he can fund an appeal, was on Thursday night contacted for comment on the suggestion he wanted to access data on the athlete biological passport (ABP) system - an electronic drug testing record for professional athletes. The ex-British Cycling doctor, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, was reportedly twice denied a request to British Cycling’s anti-doping commission, which included two representatives from UK Anti-Doping (Ukad), to access the ABP data - in 2014 and 2016. Ukad did not consider it appropriate to give him access, but Freeman, according to The Times and BBC, wrote in the 2016 message to bosses that he would use the data “for statistical analysis similar to that performed by the anti-doping agencies”. He added: “This is an opportunity to assess frequency of testing and give warning of target testing.” Freeman added that it would allow “early detection in fluctuations of the riders' ABP (athlete biological passport)” and give “time for riders to consider reasons as to why there are fluctuations and prepare a defence”. It was suggested this access would allow British Cycling to produce monthly reports with independent help on individual riders based on hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels. Under a colour coding system, a green, amber or red marker would help identify a possible anti-doping sanction. On Thursday night British Cycling said in statement: “In February 2016, Dr Richard Freeman made a proposal to the federation’s anti-doping commission, which included two representatives from UK Anti-Doping, that Ukad share information from athlete biological passport monitoring with the medical team for the Great Britain Cycling Team. “The minutes from the meeting record that this proposal was made with the intention of better supporting the work of anti-doping organisations. The minutes also record that the proposal was not accepted and that this would be confirmed in writing.” The email surfaced as Freeman, suspended by his industry with immediate effect until the process of “erasure” has taken place, considers whether to mount an appeal. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel ruled last week that his fitness to practise was “impaired” and he ordered testosterone to the national velodrome in May 2011 “knowing or believing” it was intended for doping purposes. Freeman said he “disagreed vehemently” with the determination, instead claiming he was bullied into ordering the Testogel , an allegation Sutton strongly denies. British Cycling has already been facing questions this week over allegations it was allowed by Ukad to carry out its own internal probe into a rider’s sample, which allegedly contained traces of a banned anabolic steroid. Ukad is said to have informed British Cycling of the sample, which dates from the autumn of 2010 and allegedly contained traces of a metabolite of nandrolone, with British Cycling then conducting its own internal follow-up, using a private laboratory, HFL Sport Science in Cambridgeshire, to run tests on four riders. ""In response to those claims, British Cycling said the departure of key personnel in the intervening period made an investigation challenging, and ""we are unable to give full comment on this story at this stage as the events took place over 10 years ago"". Ukad said it was ""examining archives to confirm decisions that were taken in 2011 followed due process set by Wada."" A legal representative for Freeman said last night: “Richard is subject to a Ukad investigation and hoping to appeal the MPTS decision. He is not speaking to anyone.”",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2021/04/01/new-questions-british-cycling-richard-freeman/
23,Dinara Safina interview: 'I felt stupid saying I was world No 1 - I couldn't handle it',"Dinara Safina stood in front of her bathroom mirror, looked herself in the eye, and said, “I am No  1. I am the best.” It sounds like a scene from a mushy motivational movie – Dead Poets Society, perhaps, or A League of Their Own. But Safina experienced no surge of inspiration. No matter how she delivered the words, they just didn’t feel right. “Maybe for somebody it works,” she says during a Zoom call from her home in Monaco. “Maybe it helps self-motivation or self-confidence. But you have to be the kind of person who believes this. If you don’t believe, saying that makes no sense. You can repeat a thousand, million times. But you look at yourself and say, ‘I am stupid, saying this to myself.’ ” The scene dates from Safina’s defining season of 2009 – a bewildering, discombobulating, emotional switchback ride which would have sent anyone to the psychologist’s couch. That was the year she reached successive major finals in Melbourne and Paris, winning 53 of her first 64 matches. The trend pointed ever upwards, and yet the graph never spiked in a defining peak: the conquest of that elusive grand-slam trophy. In those two major finals, Safina collected a combined tally of nine games against Serena Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ran full tilt into a mental block. “Sometimes I couldn’t handle the pressure,” admitted Safina, who is still only 34. “That’s me personally. Still in the normal life I am very hard on myself. Everything has to be perfect – like this, like this, like this. “And sometimes, when the result was not what I expected, or what I would wish, I would get so disappointed.” Safina hails from a uniquely distinguished Russian tennis family. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, used to coach at the Spartak Moscow club with her babies suspended in a sling. Her father, Mikhail Safin, was the director of that club. And her brother, Marat, was the buccaneering, vodka-loving hellraiser who won the 2000 US Open as well as the 2005 Australian Open, which would prove to be the last slam for almost five years to escape the “Big Three” men. Marat and Dinara still stand unique as the only brother/sister duo to both reach No 1 in the world. Yet they are remembered very differently: him as the cool, sunglasses-wearing type known for inviting women to watch him from his player box, her as the nearly woman who never cemented her position at the top of the game. Did she ever ask him for advice on how to handle her anxieties? “It’s tough to speak with Marat, because I think male and female are very different,” Safina replied. “Whenever he has a stress situation for him it is a challenge – ‘What can I do out of this situation?’ For them [male players] it’s fun. For a female it is more like ‘Oh my God, if I play bad, I will be so embarrassed.’ You start to doubt in yourself.” If Safina never managed to overcome her big-match nerves, that is partly because her body did not give her the chance. A stress fracture in her lower back cut her career brutally short at the age of 25, and left her bracketed alongside Jelena Jankovic as a late-Noughties world No 1 who never won a major. (Caroline Wozniacki, the final member of this maligned trio, would eventually escape the “slam-less No 1” slur by winning the 2018 Australian Open.) What next for Safina, who officially retired in 2014? Having lacked expert guidance in her own career, she now wants to steer younger players away from the same pitfalls. Before the pandemic started, she had been planning a new coaching initiative in Valencia. “I would have loved to have had a mentor,” said Safina. “Psychologists say basic things, but they have never been in the situation – not even as visitors to the match. “For me, maybe it would have been more interesting to speak to some other tennis player. “After the [2009] French Open final, I had that scarring in my heart. I was maybe one week being depressed – ‘How can I lose this final?’– instead of thinking, ‘OK, what is next coming up, and what can I do better?’  ""I would love at that moment to have had a mentor who shakes me a little and says,  ‘Wait, it’s just the French Open final, you still have Wimbledon, you still have the US Open, so stop focusing on this.’”   True to her Moscovian roots, Safina is hard-headed about the disciplines that foster success. During our conversation, she spoke about her 5.30am starts at the Australian Open, fretted about the distracting influence of electronic gadgets and denounced Instagram as a “fake world where nobody knows what is true”. Some youngsters might retreat from her directness; others would surely thrive on it. Either way, she is well qualified to join Conchita Martinez and Amelie Mauresmo as elite performers now turned to coaching. “Conchita is doing great,” said Safina of Martinez, the former Wimbledon champion who has worked with Karolina Pliskova and Garbine Muguruza. “I just wonder why other players don’t ask, ‘Can I work with you?’ or, ‘Can I have you at least as part-time coach?’ “I think there are so many players would really love to share their experience and they can be really helpful. We know tennis from a different way, we have been there, we have played. “It would be more interesting to have more female coaches. When you are on the tour as a player, you have the team, the coach, the agent, who talk to you and you never lift up your head and say, ‘Wait – can I just look around?’ Instead open your eyes a little bit, step back. Say ‘The agent is not going to tell who is for me, I’m going to say who I want.’ Because you can always find the number of the person you want and talk to him or her. It’s not that we live on another planet.”  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/03/26/dinara-safina-interview-felt-stupid-saying-world-no1-couldnt/
24,FA 'treating women's footballers as second-class citizens' over concussion risk,"The Football Association has been accused of treating women’s footballers like ""second-class citizens"" because the female game has so few resources to help diagnose concussion. Less than a month after MPs were told women are twice as likely to suffer a brain injury in collision sports such as football and rugby,   has found the Women’s Super League mandates just one doctor at matches, versus the four doctors available at a men’s Premier League game. The stark contrast in the level of medical support was described by Julian Knight, chair of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, who last month criticised the FA in its efforts to combat football’s dementia problem, as ""deeply disturbing"". While each WSL home side must provide a club doctor, there is no stipulation for away sides to do the same. Both home and away sides must provide a physio for each team. In the men’s Premier League meanwhile, the rule book states that there must be four doctors for every match, including one doctor each for home and away teams, and a ‘medical coordinator’ – more commonly known as ‘tunnel doctors’. The latter is a third doctor who acts as an extra pair of eyes at Premier League matches to spot potential concussions through TV replays and Hawk-Eye footage. They have been mandatory in the Premier League since the 2015/16 season and, while appointed and paid for by the home club, act as independent doctors. In the men’s Championship, away sides have been providing club doctors since the 2019/20 season. The Premier League also mandates that a ‘crowd doctor’ should be present as the fourth physician. In the WSL medical staff also do not have access to replays in real time, which could help them  . ""There is a major issue here and it’s certainly something we’ll take on board as part of our inquiry into concussion in sport,"" Knight told  . ""My impression is that, whereas sports such as rugby seem to be taking a proactive approach to this, football seems to be doing almost the bare minimum and it’s particularly acute when it comes to the women’s game. ""This is treating women’s footballers as second-class citizens and regardless of what they say about the expense, if they're serious about ensuring that there is a proper future for the women’s game it can’t be threadbare, particularly when it comes to safety.  ""Women’s football is almost worse than a poor relation. I think people could accept the fact that the economics of women’s football aren’t as lucrative as men’s football in terms of playing, in the same way that the championship isn’t as lucrative as the Premier League."" Despite having recently secured a multi-million broadcast deal with Sky and the BBC from next season, which is set to increase revenue in the league dramatically, The FA told   it currently has no plans to introduce tunnel doctors in the women’s top flight. Responding to the news, Knight said: ""I would call on the BBC and Sky to have urgent talks with the football authorities to make them think again about player safety. Now that we’re going to see more women’s football on television, I think people need to feel that it is equally safe as the men’s game."" Alex Davies-Jones, an MP who sits on the parliamentary committee for the DCMS, said she was ""hugely disappointed"" by the FA's lack of ambition.  ""I truly believe that having an independent doctor who is able to draw on video technology could be vital in combating concussion in sport and will be urging them to reconsider,"" she said.  Luke Griggs, the deputy chief executive of Headway, the brain injury association, argued that far greater transparency was needed regarding the role of 'tunnel doctors' in football. ""Who are they? What qualifications are needed to perform the role? What consultation goes on between tunnel doctors and the on-pitch medical teams? At the moment, we know too little about tunnel doctors to be able to judge their effectiveness,"" he said. ""What is clear is that with studies showing female athletes to be at greater risk of sustaining concussions, it is vital that everything possible is done to improve concussion management in the women’s game."" An FA spokesperson said player welfare was of ""paramount importance"" across the WSL and the Women’s Championship and it worked ""closely with clubs to ensure that the appropriate level of medical support is provided to players"". ""This includes mandatory doctors and physios at every match and extensive emergency medical equipment at pitch side,"" it added.  ""All doctors are highly trained to diagnose and manage serious injuries, including head injuries and concussions, to ensure players have the medical support required when they take to the field. ""We also work closely with clubs to monitor and record injuries and illness across both leagues in order to build a greater understanding and an accurate picture of the medical demands in the women’s game. ""We regularly review and adapt our medical protocols and processes to ensure the appropriate level of medical support is provided to the players."" In February, the FA   in the WSL and the FA Women's Championship, as well as the men's Premier League in a bid to boost player welfare around head injuries.  Towards the end of her career, Freya Holdaway, the former Crystal Palace captain, was unable to stare at a screen for more than a couple of hours at a time. One day, she woke up and burst into tears because her ears would not stop ringing. Both were indicators of the three concussions she had suffered in the space of 18 months, which left her in a constant state of anguish. ""I’d ask myself 'What if I get to 50 and I have to be put in a home?' If I keep playing, that could happen,"" Holdaway, who earned six caps for Northern Ireland, tells  . ""I had those moments of panic. I didn’t want to go through that sort of thing."" The former centre-back wants to share the story of how concussion ended her career prematurely at 31 as a warning to the current crop of elite female players. The first time Holdaway experienced concussion was during a pre-season friendly in July 2018, when her head ""swelled up straight away"". The visible nature of the injury prompted her to leave the pitch immediately. Nine months later, in a friendly, she took a knock to the temple and brushed it off as a minor incident. ""I banged heads with another player and everyone explained it like two shin pads smashing together,"" Holdaway recalls. ""When the physio came on, she said 'Come off for a few minutes and hang out by the goal just to get yourself together. They might put you on for the second half'."" Holdaway walked around the pitch, trying to gather herself, but did not feel right. ""The next minute, the floor came up to my face,"" she says. ""That was me obviously hitting the ground."" What happened next was shocking for a player who, moments before, had been considering a return to the pitch. Holdaway experienced a concussive seizure, a fit of such severity that it is often confused with post-traumatic epilepsy, occurring in roughly one concussion case in 70. It is chilling to consider what might have transpired had she returned to the field. ""If I headed the ball again or banged somebody else's head…what sort of damage could there have been?"" she says. Despite the incident, Holdaway made a full return to football. But in October 2019 she was concussed again as she headed away a goalkeeper’s kick. Research on women’s players in the United States has shown that the forces generated by heading the ball from goal-kicks can reach 100g, which is similar to NFL players crashing into each other. ""After that, I didn’t want to drive home. But I thought 'Am I being a bit paranoid?' Heading the ball from a goal-kick – a normal part of the game – is what made me feel awful again for months."" Holdaway was later diagnosed with concussion. So persistent were her symptoms this time that she had to take a month off work. ""I’ve never slept particularly well, but I was sleeping 12 hours solid,"" says Holdaway, whose team-mates and staff at Palace, as she puts it, watched her ""withdrawing from the game a bit"". The pandemic-enforced break last year was a blessing in disguise. The suspension of all elite women’s football meant Holdaway did not head a ball. In the space of four months, her symptoms, including regular headaches and ringing in the ears, began to subside. ""I started to feel so much better than I’d been feeling in the past two years,"" she says. ""I always had the classic late-onset concussion symptoms. It wasn’t always straight away, they’d surface a week later. So if I played, I’d spend the next week worrying about how I’d felt. ""That’s when I was like 'It's time [to retire]'. I made that decision as a 30 plus year old. If I was in that position aged 23, I would still be playing, 100 per cent. That’s not the right thing."" Holdaway is now an ambassador for the Scores Project, an ongoing study investigating the rate of cognitive decline in former professional footballers and other sportspeople in the UK compared with the average healthy person. The project has  , who must be over the age of 40 to take part. ""Once I hit a certain age, 100 per cent, I’ll be the first there,"" says Holdaway. ""I’m quite happy to leave my brain to research when it’s gone because again, it’s about what impact I can have on the game."" She is also supportive of English football's plans to implement new protocols for heading in the professional game this summer, but wonders how far the measures will go for women. ""As a centre-back, I can't say footballers shouldn’t head the ball,"" she says. ""But I do think it should be massively restricted and I think there should be more emphasis on how to head the ball.""  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/exclusivefa-accused-treating-womens-footballers-second-class/
25,Rating the F1 teams after the Bahrain GP: Are Red Bull fastest and are Aston Martin in trouble?,"The 2021 Formula One season is underway with a bang after arguably the  . For the first time since 2018 Mercedes have genuine competition at the front, this time from Red Bull. It is promising for a captivating season ahead and a  . But are Red Bull actually the quickest team? Will Mercedes and Hamilton need to be at the very top of their game just to compete, as was the case on Sunday? And what about the rest of the grid? Now that we've had a decent amount of competitive running, it is a little easier to see the overall picture.  We have carefully sifted through the numbers and data to work out who the real winners and losers of F1's opening weekend were, and what this means for the season ahead.  As well as qualifying and race performance, we looked at a team's overall position as well as their progress relative to a) their average last season and b) the first race last year. We have combined this to create a progress percentage on their raw pace.  The overall rankings, then, are as much a chart of improvement as anything, rather than the ""correct"" order. So, who should be quietly confident and who is facing a long season ahead? Even on the limited running we have seen so far, Haas look to be in a similar position to Williams in 2019. That is to say they will be hopelessly adrift of even the second slowest team for the entirety of the year.  Given that they say they are not developing the current VF21 at all this season and the fact that they have two rookies   and Nikita Mazepin, this will be a long and painful season. The primary aim will be to bring their young drivers up to speed but with so little experience behind the wheel of a car that looks problematic, you have to question the wisdom of this.  No team has moved further back since 2020 and that is likely to be the direction of travel throughout 2021, too.   -1.050% (10th) There is still a long way to go yet but this has been a troubling start to the  . As Racing Point last season they were probably the third quickest team, on balance, with their Mercedes W10 imitation. And just like the actual Mercedes team this year, there is no doubt they have moved backwards in the order.  Despite Lance Stroll making it into final qualifying, Aston Martin were the seventh quickest team in Bahrain on raw pace behind the usual back three of Alfa Romeo, Williams and Haas. They are some way down on their 2020 level, with midfield rivals McLaren, AlphaTauri and Ferrari all making progress of varying degrees.  Their race showing was a little better but they now face a dilemma. Ideally the 2022 regulation changes – and F1’s new era – should be the focus of their resources, but with a start this poor the team may need to put their efforts into making this car better or face a demoralising season. Force India were very good at in-season improvement and that quality looks needed here.   -0.404% (8th) The team formerly known as Renault now have Fernando Alonso at the helm. He did his best throughout the Bahrain Grand Prix, but the A521 looked sluggish. Esteban Ocon did not fare much better, either, finishing a lap down in 13th and behind both Alfa Romeo cars. The team have made absolute progress from last year (only three teams did not) but their relative progress – which is more important – is backwards.  Again, like Aston Martin they face the “development dilemma”. No team wants to struggle outside the points for an entire year, going backwards and not forwards. But resource may be best spent on working on their 2022 car.  There is still a chance that the team and drivers can understand the car and its behaviour better as the season goes on, but you do wonder if the Renault power unit is the primary cause of its lack of pace. In   we said that the window for Alpine this year could be anywhere between third and seventh. With McLaren, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and AlphaTauri all on the up, seventh looks the more likely outcome.   +0.167% (7th) With new owners and  , the hopes at Williams would have been to continue their progress and turn it into something tangible; creating a car that can occasionally score points. On the showing in Bahrain they may have moved forward a little in overall performance but they sit in a similar place to 2020, albeit moving ahead of Haas in the order.  George Russell again made it into Q2 whilst team-mate Nicholas Latifi did not. This could be a common theme again in 2021. On everything we have seen so far, Williams risk being caught in no man’s land in ninth place – well ahead of Haas behind but well behind of whoever is ahead, whether Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin or Alpine.  +0.516% (5th)  It appears that the new aero regulations for 2021 have affected Mercedes and Racing Point – with their low-rake philosophy – more than the other teams. This, combined with Red Bull making a big step forward with their car’s stability and overall performance, has set up a mouthwatering season ahead.  Ninth in the overall progress chart looks worse than it is , but that is largely due to a stellar season in 2020. The only way was down after that.  It will be interesting to see whether they focus much on developing the W12 or look towards next year. Still, unlike the smaller teams, they should have the resource to do both. Clearly, there are still some issues. Although the car looked a match for Red Bull in the hands of Hamilton in the race, a gap of four-tenths in qualifying will be a little concerning, even with 22 rounds left in the championship.   -0.435% (9th) After pre-season testing there was a hint that McLaren could have moved ahead of the midfield pack. On the weekend’s showing it does not look like they have managed that yet, with only a small absolute improvement from last year. This should not be cause for concern.  Their biggest concern will be looking at the teams directly behind them with Ferrari resurgent and AlphaTauri on the up, too. Their consistent pace and performances throughout a season were their strengths in 2020 and it should be the same this time, especially with Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo on board.   +0.160% (6th) Alfa Romeo top the progress charts, having made a huge step forward in raw pace from both their 2020 overall time and their performance in the first race of last season. For most of last year they were cut adrift with Haas and Williams but this year there should be much more chance of success: that is to say points.  Perhaps the Ferrari power unit has helped but Alfa Romeo will be one of the teams most pleased with their performance so far. Despite being the eighth fastest team in Bahrain – where they were last year –   it is not out of the question that they could prove obstacles for Alpine and Aston Martin in the next few races and beyond.   +1.331% (1st)  Like McLaren, Ferrari would have had hopes that they could leap ahead of the midfield pack on their own. Like McLaren, that does not look to be the case. After pre-season testing there were questions over whether they might even struggle to improve all that much on last year’s dismal showing. First impressions, however, look decent.  Charles Leclerc showed the car’s potential with fourth in qualifying, just a couple of tenths behind Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes. Carlos Sainz could have been closer too, but did not nail his Q3 lap. Sixth and eighth in the final reckoning is hardly reason to crack out the bubbly but given that this is a track which rewards power, then Ferrari can feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead. It will be a tight fight with McLaren, but third place is a target.   +0.763% (4th)  Red Bull can leave Bahrain disappointed but happy overall. Their pre-season pace was not an illusion and they begin the season with the fastest car and a man capable of delivering the best from it in Max Verstappen. The worry will be whether they can keep up with Mercedes – or keep them at bay in qualifying – for very long.  The 0.388secs that separated Verstappen and Hamilton in qualifying was significant. But the performance gap between Red Bull and Mercedes was, well, almost impossible to call even after 56 laps. With so many races this year and a huge variety of tracks, it is likely we will see the order see-sawing but, whatever, the RB16B looks a seriously impressive car and already arguably their best of the turbo-hybrid era.  Development throughout the season has usually been their strong point. It has had to be, as the team have been painfully slow starters. The giants they have to fell in Hamilton and Mercedes are now within touching distance, but it appears that it will take a monumental effort to down them.  +0.782% (3rd) It might seem strange to have a team that only scored two points with one ninth place at the top of this list. That was the case with Racing Point after the first race of last year and it is the same with AlphaTauri this year. Their potential is enormous, but they did not deliver on it on Sunday.  Pierre Gasly has always gone well in Bahrain but qualifying fifth is a fantastic result. Yuki Tsunoda could have been up there as well – and he looks a serious prospect – but for a mistake in Q2. Gasly made contact with Daniel Ricciardo early on and that ruined his race, but it is not an exaggeration to say that they could cause headaches for Ferrari and McLaren this year on current form.  Going by the data, the Honda engine seems to be a massive upgrade on last year’s, which should serve them well. Aerodynamically the car – like its sister at Red Bull – appears compliant to the drivers’ will. There are many reasons to be excited for the Italian team this year.   +0.972% (2nd) ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2021/03/30/rating-f1-teams-bahrain-gp-red-bull-fastest-aston-martin-trouble/
26,What Red Bull must do to topple Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes,"If pre-season testing hinted that Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton-led dominance could be under serious threat, then   highlighted it, underlined it, and then  .  Red Bull and Max Verstappen will be gutted with their failure to capitalise on a winning position under lights in the desert. They should be. Regardless of their current form, they have not had many chances to win in the past few years and whatever their performance advantage in Bahrain, it was not enough. After just 14 wins in 119 races, contending for a championship is a new experience for a lot of this Red Bull team. They must now assess what they can do in the next eight months and 22 grands prix to topple F1’s most dominant team and driver. Here's how they can do it. As a driver, Verstappen is arguably Hamilton’s only equal on the grid. Provided that he and Hamilton are close in the points table, this gives the title fight a totally different dimension — and may help force mistakes from the champion. In the past two years Hamilton  , which was done with ease. In 2017 and 2018 he was  , who managed to put Hamilton under pressure, only to implode himself. There is very little that Mercedes and Hamilton have not achieved in their eight years of dominance. But defeating a driver of truly comparable talent and skills in comparable machinery? That is yet to happen.  But, in this record-breakingly long season, Red Bull cannot afford to give Mercedes and Hamilton a head start. They must repeat the intensity (but not the outcome) of their first race of the 2021 season. The seven and 13 points that Verstappen and Red Bull are behind respectively is neither here nor there, but if that morphs to 20 or 30 points in four or five rounds time – however close those races are – then Mercedes are back in their usual spot, which is where Hamilton feels comfortable.  For the past two years Red Bull have been fighting with one hand tied behind their back as first Pierre Gasly and then Alexander Albon failed to match Verstappen in qualifying and races. Can Sergio Pérez do any better? If Red Bull want to take their chances, he has to.  In fairness, he does not even have to match Verstappen, but he absolutely must be a factor at the front of the race and be close enough to him or both Hamilton and Bottas to stop Mercedes having two strategy options to cover the Dutchman. This was evident on Sunday: had Mercedes not botched Bottas’s second pit stop then Verstappen’s charge to the front would have been harder.  Pérez looked some way off Verstappen this weekend, but this is only his first race for the team. Red Bull should bear some responsibility for his lowly starting position after taking a risk on tyre choice in qualifying, but at worst he needs to be starting fourth and keeping both Mercedes honest.  Red Bull have been notoriously slow starters and have never truly challenged Mercedes dominance over a season. The last time Red Bull took pole position at the first race of the year was in 2013. The last time they had a car finish in the top two on its first outing? 2012. For the first time in the turbo-hybrid era, they are out of the blocks as contenders. It usually takes a while for them to walk the walk after talking the talk.  If the teams are as close as it seems then a development dilemma occurs for both of them. Do they plough resource into a tight championship fight or focus on the massive regulation changes for next year’s car? Fortunately, Red Bull’s development path is usually steep because it has had to be. Last year Mercedes stopped developing their 2021 car after seven rounds – this year they may be forced into a different approach.  Having the quickest car over one lap is a good start, but it is not enough. We know that from Ferrari's failed attempts in 2017 and 2018 and towards the end of 2019 (although the titles were all but decided). Hamilton has experienced this too, in his first year at Mercedes in 2013, when the team had a run of eight pole positions in nine races but only triumphed in three of them.  With these heavy, super high-downforce beasts, track position is important, as Hamilton proved. But a race is won on Sunday, not Saturday. It could become a sore point quickly if Verstappen continues to take pole positions yet is beaten by Hamilton on race day. Clearly, that cannot happen. It looks like Red Bull have the advantage in raw pace – perhaps even a hefty one in Verstappen’s hands – but there was little to separate them in the race on Sunday at any point. ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2021/03/29/red-bull-must-do-topple-lewis-hamilton-mercedes/
27,Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez vs Billy Joe Saunders: when is the fight and what are they saying?,"Billy Joe Saunders, the unbeaten British fighter, is to face Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in a super middleweight unification megafight. The bout is scheduled for May 8, the Cinco de Mayo weekend, at a venue yet to be announced. Miami, Dallas or Las Vegas are the three most likely locations. The four titles on the line are from the WBC, WBA Super, WBO and Ring Magazine. A win for Alvarez would leave him with IBF champion Caleb Plant to beat in order to hold every world championship at super middleweight. A win for Saunders would be one of the greatest British victories of all time. Alvarez destroyed the WBC's mandatory challenger, Avni Yildirim, in three rounds on Saturday 27 February, at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in front of 12,000 fans. Often referred to as the bad boy of British boxing, the Hertfordshire fighter comes from the traveller race and is undefeated as a two-weight world champion in a 30-fight career. He has been fined on several occasions by the British Boxing Board of Control for ill-discipline, and, just hours after the Alvarez fight was confirmed, appeared on Instagram wearing an apron with a fake penis, in a video from his training camp in Spain. “Canelo, I’m ready to rock and roll,” Saunders said. “You have to dare to be great and you aren’t going to be a great if you don’t beat the greats. I believe I am the only one with the footwork, knowhow, skillset, mindset and brain to unlock that door in Canelo. ""He’s the main man in the sport and the face of boxing. You have to give him respect, he hasn’t ducked anyone, he’s beaten good names, but nobody is unbeatable, and I believe I have got the tools to beat him if I use them properly. “I am looking at the golden ticket to cement my legacy, and that’s how you have to go in there to beat him. I’ve won everything from Southern Area to world titles. I could say ‘I’ve won it all, been to the Olympics, I’m unbeaten — I’ll see you later’. But I’ve only just turned 31, I’ve got no miles on the clock, haven’t taken any punishment — I believe he’s been in harder fights than me and has more miles, so I want to cement my legacy and beat him.” The Mexican is ranked the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. He is a world champion in four weight divisions from light-middleweight to light heavyweight. Saunders will be the  seventh British fighter to take him on; Alvarez’s victory over Turkey's Yildirim followed his triumph over Liverpool's Callum Smith in December. The youngest of seven brothers who have all fought professionally, Alvarez has gone 57 fights with just one defeat — to Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013. He has acknowledged that in Saunders, he will face an accomplished and awkward southpaw. ""He’s a very difficult fighter. We need to go for him,"" he said. ""People talk, but I’m a mature fighter. I know how to control myself.  All I need to do is go into the ring, win and make history. “I want to unify the division. No one has done it in Latin America. In the world only a few fighters have done it — the best. I want to make history and be one of the best in the world.”",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/0/saul-canelo-alvarez-vs-billy-joe-saunders-fight-when-where/
28,Meet English rugby's 'Holy Trinity' ready for Six Nations challenge,"""We bring a lot to the table because we are different on and off the field,"" says Jess Breach, describing her England back-three combination with Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne. ""Abby is so intelligent with her engineering degree; Ellie is crazy and does what she wants. We build each other up and know how to speak to each other. Because we have known each other for a long time, it makes it easier."" This relationship was forged on a bleak November night in 2017 with just over 2,000 fans watching. Those few who had made the trip to Allianz Park to watch England thrash Canada 79-5 witnessed the first Test appearances of three of the Red Roses’ brightest stars. Wings Breach and Dow and full-back Kildunne, who came on as a replacement, scored nine tries between them, with Breach crossing for a remarkable haul of six. Surprisingly, this will be the first full Six Nations campaign the trio will play together due to Breach and Kildunne both having stints in sevens, while Dow refused a professional rugby contract to complete her engineering degree at Imperial College. Yet she still made 15 Test appearances while studying full-time. At the end of the 2017 series against Canada a photograph was taken of the trio with Danielle Waterman — then the incumbent full-back — to show a changing of the guard and what England’s future back three might look like. It may have taken three years but they finally reunited for England XVs last autumn and at times looked telepathic in their play. Dow said: ""All our journeys since we made our England debuts have been different, but that is what we need as rugby players. It is quite nice to see us all come back making us the same team but we are all very different. We all have better strengths, which means we all play more exciting rugby when we are on the pitch together. ""My favourite rugby memory was after the last game of that 2017 series we got that photo taken and it is special to think this will be our first full Six Nations together."" As well as their electric pace and superb finishing ability, the three are genuinely close friends and have an on-field telepathy. Although different sports, the trio have synergy reminiscent of that of Manchester United’s Holy Trinity of George Best, Denis Law and Sir Bobby Charlton because of what different characters they are. However, due to their tender years the comparison is lost on Breach, Dow and Kildunne. Dow, 23, is a deep thinker who takes glee in describing her final experiment for her degree, which involved looking at rechargeable batteries. However, Breach, also 23, enjoys fashion, celebrity gossip and keeping on top of all the developments in her team-mates’ personal lives while Kildunne, 21, has a creative mind and an artistic streak and discovered a passion for making and editing videos during the first lockdown when she was uncertain of her future in the England sevens programme. ""Jess is what I call a logical princess. She always has a good point to make but she is always such a princess about it, but I love that about her! And she is the finisher – she does everything she needs to do to be the perfect winger and score tries,"" Dow says. Breach replies: ""When Abby talks about stuff I don’t understand I just switch off and Abby knows to stop talking. I don’t want to speak about engineering or a phone battery! It makes my brain frazzle. It makes me feel like I learnt nothing in school."" Dow and Breach, hailing from Maidenhead and Chichester respectively, have known each other since their mid-teens as regular opponents. But Kildunne, who was born and bred in Yorkshire, is now firmly in the fold. Breach and Kildunne shared a house together while Kildunne and Dow have linked up in the Wasps back three this season. During their time playing side by side in the Premier15s Kildunne has enjoyed getting to know Dow. ""Abby is different in the best way possible,"" she said. ""She is an individual. I really, really like it because it makes me feel like it is OK for me to be different too. We bounce off each other really well, the amount of conversations we have had about curly hair and I never get bored of it."" Although she is less than two years younger, Kildunne looks to Breach as a role model, saying: ""Off the pitch, I have always felt like Jess is like an older cousin or sister who always makes sure I am in line and looks out for me. If I am being stupidly spontaneous or whatever, she puts me back in line. Jess is really mature; she knows what she is doing."" Breach buts in quickly: ""Ellie is such a magical player, someone that will create something out of nothing, which I think is quite rare to find. Off the pitch she is so spontaneous – but that has led to some of the best experiences."" Sarah McKenna, who had been in flying form before injury ruled her out for a large chunk of last year, and former world player of the year nominee Lydia Thompson, join the young trio in Simon Middleton’s squad as back-three options for the truncated Six Nations, which takes on the same format as the men’s Autumn Nations Cup. England are drawn in a pool with Scotland, who they play on Saturday in Doncaster, and Italy.  is being predicted on resources, but Scotland did hold France to a draw last year. Dow, Breach and Kildunne are all hopeful for long rugby careers together and that this campaign is just the beginning. But their biggest goal is for major growth in the women’s game over the next decade. ""I hope our sport will be much more financially viable if it becomes its own business,"" Dow says. ""We are struggling with that now; we want it to become a business like the men’s game where we get the crowds in and we can pay our way. As soon as we can dissociate from the men more, we could be able to provide our own platform."" ""I want more young girls to get involved and to allow them to have that dream to be a professional rugby player,"" Breach says. ""When we were all young you couldn’t really dream of it and you could sound stupid or silly, but it shouldn’t sound that way now."" Kildunne concludes: ""I want people to know who we are and that we are not just inspirations for younger girls but younger boys. I want people to see us as athletes and powerful women.""",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/03/31/meet-english-rugbys-holy-trinity-ready-six-nations-challenge/
29,From '12 pints a day' to fighting fit... in two weeks: Inside a Tyson Fury training camp,"A fortnight ago, the sporting world stopped to hear the short, simple words it has long been waiting for: It’s on. But for Tyson Fury the announcement   with Anthony Joshua meant something different. It was time to get to work. Pictures emerged on Tuesday night of the Gypsy King looking lean, strong and fight-ready - just weeks after his claim he was ""drinking 12 pints a day"". It points to a fighter stepping up through the gears and demonstrates the impact of his early training regime. There are still three months until the fight, and there is yet to be white smoke on a venue, but time waits for no man and Fury has clearly not been sitting idle. Ben Davison, Fury’s former trainer   and helped him lose 10st in his comeback to be two-time heavyweight champion, talks us through life in a Tyson Fury training camp. Fury’s volatile weight has long been a point of fascination to outsiders. But, says Davison, it is not an issue in the rigours of the camp. ""There’s no need to monitor Tyson’s weight,"" he explains to  . ""He likes to jump on the scales himself in the morning. I’m sure he’ll have his nutritionist George Lockhart in, who cooks all his meals and keeps him on point with his diet. He’ll be taking care of all that."" Davison says Fury's regimen will include two sessions a day and encompass sparring, bag work, technical moves, footwork, strength and conditioning and running. ""He has his regular strength and conditioning, sparring - everything just gets tightened up,"" he says. ""Screws get tightened for preparation. He’s training all the time, twice a day, but in camp every detail is looked over. But Fury’s weight for fight week, and on fight night will be determined by the game plan."" Four months is a long time to sustain the punishing physical and mental regime of a training camp. ""Tyson's mood can change throughout the day, or weekly,” Davison says. ""I always found when he had a fight coming up, not necessarily the tick over jobs, but a genuine fight coming up that he wanted to perform in when he feels a little bit of pressure on his shoulders, it balances him. ""It’s almost like that’s where he finds his warrior spirit home. It is when he is most himself, the most complete, the most comfortable. The best version of Tyson is when there’s pressure. Physically, mentally, emotionally he finds a home in camp."" Fury will be watching Joshua fights, particularly his last few contests, looking for the footwork and feints that his rival uses, but also other fighters such as Roy Jones Jr, Floyd Mayweather, Muhammad Ali for inspiration. ""We were constantly watching boxing in the fight camp home. There was always boxing on and going over a fight. We’re all boxing fans as well as students of the sport,"" says Davison. Part of Fury’s ritual during camp is to attend church services at the weekends. ""[He] goes to church on the weekends. He likes to get up and go to Starbucks in the morning. He also likes having his brothers Shane and Hughie around."" Fury famously said   fight in Las Vegas in February 2020 that he was masturbating seven times a day to 'keep testosterone pumping' - but it may have just been headline clickbait, or his penchant for teasing reporters. ""I don't know, I don't check how often he masturbates. I don't keep a checklist on that,"" said Davison. Fury's brothers play a major part in camp. They are there from start to finish. His father John Fury, an outspoken character and former professional heavyweight boxer, is vastly knowledgeable and has an input in strategy and game plan. ""Hughie is a young but mature character. Passionate. I know he finds it hard watching Tyson fight and is very emotionally involved, as you can imagine,"" explains Davison, while brother Shane can play 'bad cop' in camp. ""Shane is a funny character, but a big character and a big guy. Both of them will tell Tyson what they think and I think that’s great to have. If he does something they disagree with, they’ll have that discussion with him. Let’s say another member of the team may not feel comfortable to put him in his place and may not express their feelings,"" revealed Davison. ""But he will know that the family thinks and I think that's important when you've got big fights coming up. It's important you're kept on the straight and narrow. You need someone giving you some home truths. All those adds to having a good performance. ""But when it gets to fight time - Tyson, like Josh Taylor, Billy Joe Saunders, who I also work with - the bottom line is that they would give up their purse to know for sure they’re going to win the fight. It's what sets the best boxers apart."" Fury normally has a visit from his wife, Paris, on the Thursday of fight week, if they have been separated for a long period. Paris is expecting their sixth child. It is hard to pin down exactly where Fury will base himself - and for how long - with no venue yet confirmed. Saudi Arabia   with Joshua. ""The thing about Tyson is he’s very unpredictable,"" Davison says. ""Tyson’s unpredictable in his training, he’s unpredictable in his lifestyle. He might want to go to Saudi [if fight is confirmed there] eight weeks before or he could decide to only go a few days before. He’s just so unpredictable. I wouldn’t be surprised if he set up his training camp at home and trained from home and then flew over there maybe the week of the fight or two weeks before.""  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2021/03/31/12-pints-day-fighting-fit-two-weeks-inside-tyson-fury-training/
30,"Sarah Winckless, Boat Race umpire: 'With my Huntington's it is about seizing every opportunity'","For a pioneer, Sarah Winckless is keen to remain in the shadows. This weekend she will become the first woman in the event’s 166-year history to umpire the men’s University Boat Race. But she hopes no one will even notice she is there. “I’ll start the race by waving a red flag and finish it by waving a white one,” she says. “And if I do nothing else in between it will have been a successful race for me. I’ve briefed both crews and if they do as I have asked I will have absolutely nothing to do.” Nothing to do: as ambitions go it is, well, ambitious. The Boat Race may only have 10 rules, but almost every year several of them are infringed. In the past umpires have been obliged to deal with everything from sinking boats to swimming protesters. Not to mention bellowing warnings into their megaphone while semaphoring their flags like overexcited boy scouts in the attempt to keep the two boats apart. “I remember as a student loving it when the umpire started flagging because it meant there was going to be a collision,” she says.  “But I think as in football – when a really good referee will facilitate the game to allow the players to play – I hope if I intervene it will only be to allow them to row.” Winckless has had more time than most to think about how she will approach her history-informing debut. She was chosen to umpire last year, before lockdown rules were implemented just ahead of the race. “It was so quick the way it unravelled,” she recalls. “I remember having a meeting a couple of weeks before it was due to happen and I said: ‘This Covid, do we need to worry?’ The answer was: ‘No, of course not’. Two weeks later the world had changed.” It changed so substantially the race was never rowed. For the students involved it was a devastating blow: several of them had missed the chance of a lifetime. And it was not just them concerned the possibility had disappeared with the tide. “It was really tough for those athletes, to be so close and my first thought was for them,” she says. “But I have to admit there was a selfish moment for me. It was an amazing honour to be named as the first woman to do that race and of course the thought did cross my mind: is that my opportunity gone?” And for Winckless, seizing opportunity has been the driving instinct of her life. Because this is a woman who lives to a time scale. Back in her own days at Cambridge – when she won blues in rowing, basketball, netball and athletics – her mother was diagnosed with Huntington’s disease. It had been creeping up on her for years – the pair had briefly fallen out when her temper frayed due to the condition. And when it became clear that her mother was in the grip of a terminal, degenerative condition, Winckless took the decision to be tested to see if she had the faulty gene that made her vulnerable to contracting it. She did. “I truly believe knowledge is power,” she says of her decision to find out if she had a genetic disposition. “There’s no doubt I struggled in the first few months after getting the news. I remember I was with Ian Dryden, a Cambridge coach, and I was doing an ergo test which got a bit painful and I stopped, blurting out dramatically: ‘there’s no point I’ve got Huntington’s’. And Ian just looked at me and said: ‘Not today you haven’t, now get on with it.’ It is something I thank him for every day.” The fear of what lay ahead never for a moment applied a brake to her ambition. She went on to a magnificent international rowing career, gaining a bronze medal at the Athens Olympics and twice being a member of the world championship winning four. If anything the very fact that she had the sentence hanging over her delivered the opposite result: it made her more determined to seize every moment. Though she knows one day it is coming, as yet, at the age of 47, she has experienced none of the symptoms.  “I never know when my horizons might shorten,” she says. “It makes me believe in taking opportunities, because I may not be well enough if I wait. I can never allow myself to think: oh well there could be another chance.” And when she took up umpiring after her competitive career had come to an end, her approach was typical of her governing attitude to life: for her there can be no half measures. “I went for it,” she says. “My goal was to be the best Boat Race umpire I could be. I had to do a lot of river umpiring to make sure I was developing. The men already on the umpiring panel were amazingly generous with their time. I did a lot of shadowing. “I’d never raced the Tideway because in my day the women’s boat race was at Henley. So I became a student of the race, out on the Thames as often as I could be.” Her homework paid off, allowing her three times to umpire the women’s and the reserve Boat Races. Though, as things turned out, her intense knowledge of the stretch of the Thames between Putney and Mortlake will not be of much use on Sunday now she has been called up for the men’s event. Because of the need to keep crowds away and the deteriorating condition of Hammersmith Bridge, the race will take place on a stretch of the Great Ouse, at Ely. “I know it reasonably well. I was a student there, I’ve done some umpiring for the trial eights for Cambridge. And it’s a simple course, straight with a very small bend and a much more uniform stream. It’s not a case like on the Tideway of fighting for the best water.” It will be, too, the first ever Boat Race conducted without the crowds thronging the tow path, getting their feet soaked by the wash spurted by the flotilla of boats following the race crews. “I’m disappointed for the rowers,” she says of the lack of spectators. “But we are in the time we are. I guess as an umpire it simplifies things: no crowds there means less chance of intrusion.” And, she suggests, less chance of her becoming the story.  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rowing/2021/04/02/sarah-winckless-boat-race-umpire-huntingtons-seizing-every-opportunity/

32,"F1 2021: full race calendar, season schedule and how to watch on TV","Last   was heavily disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but the FIA and F1 still managed to put on a season of 17 races. The pandemic is ongoing but that has not stopped a record 23-race season being planned.  That said, the Australian Grand Prix, planned for mid-March, has already been postponed until November. This means that the season now starts on March 26 with first free practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix.  Read below for more information about the season, including winter testing, car launch dates and the full calendar.  A fair bit and not a lot. You should remember that 2021 was supposed to be the start of a new era for F1 as significant regulation – and budgetary – changes came into play. With the financial damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, however, F1 decided to put back the regulation changes until 2022. Budgetary requirements have still come in ( ) but the cars will, largely, be the same as last season with a few small but significant tweaks. The Pirelli tyres have a new construction for this season, too.  First and foremost, though, there are two ""new teams"". Or rather two teams that have new names. Renault have become Alpine and Racing Point have become Aston Martin.  The biggest and most significant change is the potential for three qualifying 'sprint' races, which would decide the grid order for Sunday's Grand Prix at the British, Italian and Brazilian rounds. Excluding any sprint race trials, the traditional four-day weekend – with Thursday usually reserved for various media duties – has been turned into a three-day event. The days of four hours worth of free practice are gone, too. Free practice one and two – previously 90 minutes each – will now only run for an hour. The 60 minutes of final practice on Saturday remains unchanged, though   rules will now apply after that session rather than after qualifying.  There are a couple of new and returning circuits for this season, too. The first comes with the   on September 5 (this was due to run in May last season) and also the inaugural  on the Jeddah Street Circuit.  On the driver side of things,  ,   and  make their debuts with Haas. Japan's   becomes the first full-time F1 driver to be born in the 21st century. Elsewhere,   moves to McLaren,   moves from McLaren to Ferrari and   lines up alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull.  And, if you particularly care about that type of thing, both Mercedes and Aston Martin will share Safety and Medical Car duties. They have been given an update for 2021 and they look pretty neat, I reckon.  W12  RB16B  MCL35M : AMR21 A521  SF21 AT02  C41 VF21  : FW43B  If you are in the UK, you can watch every practice session, qualifying and race on Sky Sports F1. Highlights will be broadcast on Channel 4 on Saturday and Sunday evenings, with one race – likely the British Grand Prix – shown live.  If you are outside of the UK there is a good chance you will be able to subscribe to Formula One's own F1TV.  Yes, but with the coronavirus pandemic in many different stages throughout the world, we are unsure which races and how many fans. Certainly there is a good possibility that the British Grand Prix on July 18 will be able to welcome the usual hundreds of thousands of spectators, if the Government's roadmap for releasing restrictions is followed and all measures are done by June 21.  Naturally, the below dates come with the caveat that, due to the global coronavirus pandemic, these locations and dates could change. The Australian Grand Prix has already been postponed until November. Last season showed that circuits and organisers are there to step in at the last minute, so it is not unrealistic to expect a season as full as planned.   The current plan is also for fans to be allowed, in some capacity at least, but we will have to see how that goes. At the moment only those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. The Azerbaijan Grand Prix will take place behind closed doors.

33,"No England player would ever turn his back on national team to play IPL, says Rory Burns","England’s concerns that their leading players will quit international cricket if not given permission to play in the Indian Premier League is misguided, says Rory Burns, who insists he “can’t ever” see that situation arising. England’s selection policy has been criticised after centrally-contracted players were allowed to potentially miss the first Test of the summer against New Zealand if their IPL teams make it through to the latter stages of the tournament. That decision came after several players had already missed games against Sri Lanka and India this winter, while still committing to a full IPL season starting next Friday. Ashley Giles, England’s managing director, this week suggested a tougher stance from the ECB could result in players turning down central contracts if denied the chance to compete in the world’s most lucrative league. “We don’t particularly want to go toe-to-toe with our players over IPL participation in the long run because we may face losing some of our best players,” he told the BBC’s   show. No player has turned down a full central contract, which can be worth in excess of £1 million, at the peak of their careers since they were introduced in 2000, and Burns said he fully expected that to remain the case regardless of selection policy around the IPL. “No, I can’t [see anyone turning one down] because I think the way we are currently being managed and the way the boys are being treated lends itself to a very happy camp,” he said. “Within that, playing for your country at any stage is the biggest honour and pride you can have in the game. There’s a mutual respect there and I can’t ever really see that situation occurring, no.” Burns lost his England spot at the top of the order two Tests into the recent four-match series against India and has now gone nine matches, dating back to November 2019, without an international hundred. With seven weeks of County Championship matches for Surrey before England return to duty against New Zealand, Burns is hoping to earn an international recall. “The way those [India] Tests were going you could have left out any of the batters at various different points because of the way they were set up,” said Surrey captain Burns. “Conditions were loaded in India’s favour, which is their prerogative. But it wasn’t conducive for opening the batting in terms of the way we see it in this country.  “There’s a great opportunity for me to go out and score some runs for Surrey ­– I love doing that – so that’s how I’m approaching the season. “I think there’s a bit of credit in the bank there in terms of what I’ve done over a period of time. But quite frankly it’s more about what’s going on behind my ears and how I’m approaching the game and what I’m doing with Surrey here.” Meanwhile, the Professional Cricketers’ Association has confirmed it is in talks with players and the ECB about what anti-racism stance the domestic game will take when it begins next Thursday. “We have opened up this topic to the PCA representatives within each team for thoughts and ideas on how to show solidarity against racism,” a PCA spokesman told  .",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/04/01/no-england-player-would-ever-turn-back-national-team-play-ipl/
34,Sachin Tendulkar in hospital with coronavirus,"Sachin Tendulkar was taken to hospital on Friday as a precautionary measure six days after announcing that he had coronavirus. The 47-year-old is one of the most high-profile victims of a new surge of the virus in the country of 1.3 billion people. ""As a matter of abundant precaution under medical advice, I have been hospitalised,"" Tendulkar tweeted ""I hope to be back home in a few days. Take care and stay safe everyone."" Tendulkar is adored across India, and fans took to social media to wish their cricket ""God"" a speedy recovery. Indian Premier League teams like the Delhi Capitals all released messages of goodwill. ""Wishing a speedy recovery to the little master,"" IPL player Mufaddal Vohra said on Twitter. ""Praying for the speedy recovery of Sachin Tendulkar,"" said Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI, India's national cricket board. Former Pakistan arch-rival Wasim Akram also sent special wishes. ""Even when you were 16, you battled world's best bowlers with guts and aplomb... so I am sure you will hit Covid-19 for a six!"" said Akram, who bowled at Tendulkar in his debut series as a 16-year-old. ""Recover soon master! Would be great if you celebrate India's World Cup 2011 anniversary with doctors and hospital staff... do send me a pic!"" Tendulkar is cricket's highest run-scorer in Test matches and one-day internationals. He retired in 2013 after playing in 200 Tests, in which he made 15,921 runs. He scored another 18,426 runs in 463 ODIs and hit 100 centuries across both formats. Just days before announcing he had the coronavirus, Tendulkar had led an India Legends team to a win over Sri Lanka  . Three other players who took part in the ""Road Safety World series"", including brothers Yusuf and Irfan Pathan, have also tested positive for the virus. Crowds were allowed into the stadium in Mumbai for the matches. India is battling a new wave of Covid-19 cases - daily infections rose to more than 81,000 on Friday with 469 deaths, the highest since October.

35,Martin Johnson tribute: A press box legend who brought laughter wherever he travelled,"The last time I spoke to Martin Johnson over the phone, I found myself crying with laughter on the train into London. It was a familiar experience for those lucky enough to know the ultimate raconteur of British sport – a man who was even funnier in person than he was in print. Johnson - who has died at the age of 71 - wrote for the Daily Telegraph between 1995 and 2008. It was the centrepiece of a magnificent career that began at the Leicester Mercury in the 1970s and also included sizeable stints at the Independent - where he made his first foray into Fleet Street - and latterly at the Sunday Times. Even amidst the eccentricities of the press box, Johnson was one of a kind: a correspondent who could skewer the shortcomings of a team or athlete as accurately as any straight news reporter, yet do it while simultaneously triggering a belly laugh. He had so many great moments, but the stand-outs tend to involve England cricket tours, for that was the sport which prompted his finest work. In the winter of 1986-87, as Mike Gatting’s Ashes tourists stumbled through their warm-up matches, he famously wrote that “There are only three things wrong with this England team: they can’t bat, they can’t bowl and they can’t field.”  When I rang him in 2017, while preparing a historical piece on Gatting’s Ashes, he expressed wonderment at the way his quip has lived on. “It’s extraordinary how the “Can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” thing survives, like finding somebody’s teeth in a pile of ashes,” said Johnson, who was used to being asked to wheel out his memories of the tour. “It must be like being an impressionist, like Alistair McGowan, and being asked to do your Harold Wilson every time you go to dinner.” The other central story from his days on the cricket trail dates from the 1996-97 tour of Zimbabwe - a particularly ill-fated trip - where his clear-eyed questioning provoked the then England coach David “Bumble” Lloyd into a notorious outburst. “England had just drawn with Zimbabwe with scores level,” recalled Peter Hayter, a great friend of Johnson’s who was then covering cricket for the Mail on Sunday. “The mood at the post-match press conference was prickly, to put it mildly. Mike Atherton [then England captain] was eyeballing Martin, and Bumble suddenly burst out saying ‘We flippin’ murdered ’em, everybody knows that.’ Martin had the last laugh, as ever. He wrote that ‘When you’re murdering a person it’s advisable to make sure they’re no longer breathing.’” As it happened, Atherton simmered down and knocked on Johnson’s door that evening with a bottle of wine, which they shared in a mood of reconciliation. And neither was he the only England captain to make up with Johnson in this way after reacting angrily to one of his barbs. David Gower - a man so easy-going that he would sometimes be viewed as a dilettante - was once moved to threaten litigation over the suggestion that his leadership might be improved by a frontal lobotomy “Even I, having known him so long, took exception,” recalled Gower, whose apprenticeship at Leicestershire had coincided with Johnson’s days on the county beat. “We got a lawyer to write a letter to the sports editor of the Independent threatening to close them down if an apology wasn’t made. Martin rang me, said ‘What’s going on?’ I said ‘I want a bottle of champagne, make it a magnum. I want you to deliver it to my home and then we can drink it. It was a suitably amicable settlement out of court, and certainly didn’t cloud our friendship. “Martin was a writer of great skill, and he wrote primarily to entertain himself,” added Gower. “He was also fiercely independent and wasn’t afraid to put the boot in. Mike Turner [Leicestershire’s chief executive] would look enviously at Leicester City football club up the road and note that when they lost 6-0, the report would say they were unlucky, because the football reporter was almost a PR man on the club staff. Turner once asked me to speak to Martin about it, but as soon as we got to the bar for a chat, he turned to me and said ‘Quiet word – if it’s about what I am writing for the Mercury, don’t bother.’” Johnson was not famed as a news-getter - and indeed within the press box he was known ironically as “Scoop”. He could be accident-prone, as when the Telegraph sent him to cover a heavyweight boxing bout between Lennox Lewis and Ray Mercer. Having arrived at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in search of his ring-side seat, Johnson was told that he was at the wrong venue, and the fight was way out east. “East side of town?” he replied. “No sir, east as in East Coast.” It was actually being staged in New York. Yet he was certainly much more than just a gags man. He was an astute observer of sport in general, and an enthusiastic participant - particularly on the golf course, where his distinctive, Sid James-ish cackle would ring out whenever a shot went astray. “Our games with Chris Lander [the former Daily Mirror cricket correspondent] and others were often comedy classics,” recalled Hayter. “I’ve seen him laugh so hard that he would literally clutch his sides in pain.” That was my experience, too, when I last rang him and he re-enacted a scene from the 1987 cricket World Cup involving the food parcels that Tesco sent to the England team to keep their spirits up through five weeks on the Indian sub-continent. “There was a giant wheel of camembert, which mysteriously disappeared into Mike Gatting’s hotel room,” Johnson recalled. “John Emburey was banging on the door, saying ‘He’s got the cheese in there!’” At the time, Gatting might occasionally have felt exasperated by Johnson’s one-liners - which included the observation that “How anyone can spin a ball the width of Gatting boggles the mind” after Shane Warne’s wonder-ball of 1993. But he has fond memories of “a man with a very sharp, very dry sense of humour. The press used to put on a little play or sketch show at Christmas, when we travelled to Australia, and Martin used to write all the best lines.” There were so many to choose from. Johnson was particularly good on run-ups. For Merv Hughes, he wrote that “his mincing run-up resembles someone in high heels and a panty girdle chasing after a bus,” while Angus Fraser “looked like a man who had got his braces caught on the sightscreen.” , who - at the height of the 1990 panic over Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis - was described as suffering from “a virulent case of Boiling Scotsman Eruptus”. I can only encourage lovers of Johnson’s prose to search out his books - there are collections both of his rugby and cricket writing available second-hand, while a more recent compendium   was published by Constable in 2015.  Johnson died at the weekend after a long illness. Few men in our business have brought so much joy to so many.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2021/03/15/martin-johnson-tribute-press-box-legend-brought-laughter-wherever/

 Personal insurance and French automobile manufacturer Following the departure of Romain Bardet who had spent his entire career at the team, Ag2r-Citroën's emphasis has shifted from targeting the general classification towards the classics and hunting for stages. While much will be expected from big-name signing Greg Van Avermaet, success may well come from in-house. Benoît Cosnefroy enjoyed a long spell in the mountains jersey at last year's Tour de France before taking podium places at La Flèche Wallonne, De Brabantse Pijl and Paris-Tours to underline what a talented and versatile rider the 25-year-old is. The arrival of Bob Jungels, a former winner at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne, will provide some much-needed firepower in the early spring classics and may even provide an option in the general classification. The capture of Ben O'Connor — who won a stage at last year's Giro d'Italia — on a one-year deal appears an astute acquisition. It was thin pickings for the French team in 2020: a solitary WorldTour win in the entire season when Nans Peters proved he was no one-hit wonder a year after winning from a breakaway at the Giro d'Italia. And what a follow up it was for the young Frenchman who, racing on home turf, dropped Ilnur Zakarin on the descent of the Peyresourde before soloing to the second win of his career during stage eight at the Tour. Ag2r-Citroën may have added 11 names to their roster, but it will take some time for many to get used to Bardet, 30, no longer riding for the team. The departure to DSM may well give Bardet a much-needed new lease of life, while his former employers will be hoping for a similar boost. Kazakhstan

 Alexandre Vinokourov 
 Kazakh consortium and Canadian biotechnology company Alexandre Vinokourov may end up rueing the loss of Miguel Ángel López, but one imagines the Kazakh will not have lost too much sleep during the close season given the remaining firepower he has at his disposal. One of the big concerns for Astana, possibly, is the age of the creaking squad, with a number of the big-name riders all edging towards the latter parts of their careers: Omar Fraile (30), the Izagirre brothers (Ion, 31 and Gorka, 33) and Luis León Sánchez (37) are all in their thirties, as is Jakob Fuglsang (35) who last year won his second monument at Il Lombardia. However, along with a number of youngsters that will bring some fresh blood into the squad, the 24-year-old Aleksandr Vlasov will be hoping to build on what turned into a frustrating season for the Russian. Impressive performances at La Route d'Occitanie and a victory at the Mont Ventoux Dénivelé Challenge, along with some good results at the Italian classics, were tempered by the disappointment of having to abandon the Giro d'Italia. Bounced back at the Vuelta a España where he finished second on the Angliru stage, though, underlining why many have tipped him to become the first Astana rider since Fabio Aru in 2015 to win a grand tour. In what turned out to be one of the most breathtaking Tours de France in living memory López, the rider that is nicknamed Superman in Colombia, left his rivals gasping for air on the vertiginous slopes of the col de la Loze. The 26-year-old may not have threatened the overall, but for one majestic afternoon he rode Primoz Roglic, Sepp Kuss and Tadej Pogacar off his wheel making all three look ordinary, which they are anything but. Though far from being the team's figurehead, the departure of López overshadows any of the incoming eight riders who are, broadly speaking, untried youngsters. ""They were six wonderful years, I grew up and learned a lot with them,"" said López following his transfer to Movistar. Bahrain

 Kingdom of Bahrain Despite having lost team principal Rod Ellingworth, who returned to Ineos Grenadiers after just one season at the Bahraini squad, the future may not be as grim as some have predicted for Bahrain Victorious in 2021. The arrival of Jack Haig should bolster Mikel Landa's grand tour ambitions, while the 27-year-old may be keen on taking a leadership role in the shorter one-week races. It is elsewhere, though, where the wins may come from for the intriguingly renamed Bahrain Victorious squad. Dylan Teuns, 28, has the power and climbing ability to cope on both the Belgian cobbles and Ardennes classics, while Heinrich Haussler (36) may also challenge in the spring classics. It is Fred Wright, though, that may be the team's darkest horse. Working below the radar, away from the spotlight placed on Ineos riders, the Londoner impressed as the grand tour debutant finished fourth during a stage of last year's Vuelta a España. Jan Tratnik's win at the Giro d'Italia came as a blessed relief for the team, it was a relief too for the Slovenian whose brother and girlfriend stood at the roadside near the finish line of stage 16 at San Daniele del Friuli. Tratnik rode a canny finale and dropped Ben O'Connor, who had earlier chased him down before the pair rode towards the finish together, on the last short and steep climb of the day to claim the biggest win of his career. Signed on a three-year contract from Mitchelton-Scott — renamed BikeExchange for 2021 — Haig, in theory, is a very smart signing. The Australian diesel will a key cog in the stage-race engine room and may even land a big one for himself if he is given the freedom to roam. Australia

 Shayne Bannan 
 Australian cycling retailer The headline for some may have been the transfer of Adam Yates who joined Ineos Grenadiers during the close season, but the Briton's departure is far from being the only change within the Australian team. Along with Adam Yates, Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Daryl Impey (Israel Start-up Nation) and Edoardo Affini (Jumbo-Visma) also headed out of the exit door while the veteran  Michael Albasini retired. Coming in the other direction, Amund Grondahl Jansen arrived from Jumbo-Visma, Tanel Kangert comes in from EF Pro Cycling, Michael Matthew returns and the team signed 21-year old Italian Kevin Colleoni. And so, what to expect in 2021? With 11 of their 27-man squad at or above the age of 30, the make-up of the team is starting to look very familiar and, quite possibly, a little tired. The likes of Simon Yates and Esteban Chaves, who despite the Colombian's boyish smile is 31, need to deliver big one-day wins or launch a serious general classification challenge in the grand tours. On a more positive note, the 24-year-old Lucas Hamilton showed glimpses of promise last year, with a Tirreno-Adriatico stage win. Back-to-back stage wins at Tirreno-Adriatico from Hamilton and Simon Yates were the highlights of what had been a disappointing season. A few days later, however, Yates won the general classification ahead of fellow Briton Geraint Thomas, making the Mitchelton-Scott rider one of the favourites for the Giro d'Italia. Unfortunately the Tirreno-Adriatico title in September was as good as it got for Yates and his team-mates. Having spent four seasons at Sunweb, the return of Matthews should bring some much-needed steel in the punchy one-day classics, while the Australian can go stage hunting at the Tour. Hopefully can offer the team some belief after losing Adam Yates to Ineos Grenadiers over the winter.  Germany

 Manufacturers of kitchen appliances & bathroom products Just weeks out from the start of the season new signing Wilco Kelderman, a general classification rider who finished third at last year's Giro d'Italia, and a group of team-mates were involved in a crash during a training camp near Lake Garda in northern Italy. It was the worst possible start for Kelderman; the worst start to the new year for Bora-Hansgrohe. Just under two weeks after Kelderman was left concussed and having sustained a fractured vertebrae — while Rüdiger Selig and Andreas Schillinger were all taken to hospital — it was Peter Sagan's turn to give his team a fright after he crashed while on a training camp on Gran Canaria. Things, one feels, can only get better for the luckless squad. While much of the focus will be on an ageing Sagan, the squad has plenty of firepower upon which it can rely, including their tried and tested trio of German riders Pascal Ackermann, Emanuel Buchmann and Maximilian Schachmann. Able to challenge, respectively, in the pure sprints, the Ardennes-style climbs and the high mountains, this trident will ensure the team is challenging across all terrains once racing is under way. Things did not look good for Sagan after he had finally loosened his vice-like grip on the green jersey at the Tour de France. With sharpened quills cycling's obituary writers prepared themselves as he headed to his maiden Giro. In Italy the once imperious Sagan looked . . . normal. During stage 10, though, he launched an audacious attack from some distance out in the lashing rain to claim one of his greatest wins. Pure  . A runners-up place at Paris-Roubaix and fifth at Tour of Flanders in 2019 would suggest that Nils Politt may well be the heir apparent to Sagan who, despite his brilliant win at the Giro, is a fading force. Which may be why Bora-Hansgrohe handed the 26-year-old Politt a three-year contract. France

 Money-lending company Following their return to the top tier of cycling, much was expected from Cofidis in 2020 following their high-profile signings of Italian sprinter Elia Viviani and French general classification contender Guillaume Martin. And then? Well, not much unfortunately. It was, in summary, a poor season for the French team whose wait for a stage win at the Tour de France was extended to 13 years having again fired blanks on home turf. In the countdown to the new season, it was reported that Elia Viviani had undergone surgery having experienced heart palpitations while on a training ride. Despite the setback, he confirmed his race schedule would go ahead as planned. ""My programme remains the same,"" he said. ""I’m calm and also determined to have the season of redemption that I need."" It is not, however, all doom and gloom for Cofidis. Martin will be hoping to build on what was a promising season, while the squad has enough talent to pick off the odd win once the stage races get under way. May struggle in the one-day classics, although the addition of Luxembourg rider Jempy Drucker may go some way to help in that department. While Attilio Viviani and Anthony Perez may claim their stage wins at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo and the Tour du Haut Var were highlights of the season, it was Martin's performance during the opening week of the Tour that impressed most. Third on stage four at Orcières-Merlette behind Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar will have given the Frenchman plenty to mull over during the winter, and plenty to build on throughout 2021. Although he has just three wins on his  , veteran German Simon Geschke brings with him a wealth of experience. Though unlikely to add any money into Cofidis' prize pot, the 34-year-old will be a reliable  for leader Martin and is a more-than-capable road captain. Belgium

 Producer of windows & laminate flooring manufacturers Despite having held the   for three days at the Tour de France before a jolly green Irishman won the final stage on the Champs-Élysées, some within the team may have considered 2020 a disappointment. Even including the rainbow jersey won in Imola and their Portuguese carrying the   on his young shoulders for 15 days at the Giro d'Italia. While losing their position as the world No 1-ranked team — a title the team held for two years straight before Jumbo-Visma toppled them — Deceuninck-Quick Step also failed to win a single monument. Though not unheard of, these races are the bread and butter of the Belgian team. Though packed with talent, will be fascinating to see how they cope with the likes of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert in the cobbled classics, the races where the Belgian team is expected to perform by both sponsors and its passionate fanbase in Flanders. In Julian Alaphilippe will be eyeing success in the Ardennes and stage two at the Tour, and praying Remco Evenepoel can return to action following his long-term lay-off and finally get his grand tour career under way at the Giro. Will be interesting to see how the team manage Joao Almeida who was, arguably, the breakthrough rider of 2020 after leading the Giro for two weeks. Going into the Giro few were familiar with Almeida. Three weeks later the 22-year-old was being talked of as a potential grand tour winner. Despite the successes of Evenepoel who won all four stage races he started, it was the way in which Almeida and his team-mates defended the   that impressed most. Honourable mention goes to young Briton James Knox who worked tirelessly for his team-mate's cause. His best days may well be behind him, but ​Mark Cavendish's return to Deceuninck-Quick Step is a fascinating move from  . Whether he wins races, or most likely does not, it will be interesting to see what role Cavendish plays for the team.  Germany

 Dutch multinational In terms of race wins — 16 at Continental and WorldTour level through nine different riders — 2020 was the best year the team had had since 2017 (18) which, given the truncated nature of the season, was impressive. It was the nature of those wins, though, that stood out most. Whether eyeing an early-season win at Paris-Nice, a stage at the Tour de France or a solo sortie in the Ardennes, the team's sporting directors had it covered. Technically and tactically the squad were practically faultless. Even at the Giro d'Italia where there was a slight wobble, 24-year-old Jai Hindley won the spectacular stage that traversed the Stelvio Pass before finishing second overall; his now former team-mate Wilco Kelderman third. The departure of Marc Hirschi in the new year may have cast a shadow over DSM's preparations for the season, but the arrival of Romain Bardet is a fascinating transfer. Whether or not the Frenchman is deployed as a general classification contender, a stage hunter in the big races or the hilly one-day classics remains to be seen, but one can only assume the brains behind one of the most exciting teams of the last year have a plan.  With impressive wins from Tiesj Benoot, Hindley, Hirschi, Soren Kragh Andersen it is a difficult one: take your pick. However, Kragh Andersen's first stage at the Tour was certainly the most entertaining. In another tactical masterclass from the team, Benoot attacked off the front before Hirschi went, followed by the Dane Kragh Andersen who soloed across the line to bring home the bacon with the biggest win of his career. Hirschi​'s departure from DSM on January 5 took almost everybody by surprise. Following his stellar breakthrough season in 2020 it was assumed the team would build around him. The young Swiss, though, had other plans and four days later joined UAE Team Emirates. Ouch. US

  Education company and Japanese construction company Enjoyed their best season since 2014, won stages in all three grand tours — with six different riders — and  to produce a one-off kit, with ducks on. All-in-all, a successful season then. Following a tricky few years, Jonathan Vaughters' squad has quietly and efficiently become a well-rounded and balanced outfit, able to challenge for stages and the classics. While the departures of Daniel Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers), Michael Woods and Sep Vanmarcke (Israel Start-up Nation) and Simon Clarke (Qhubeka-Assos) will certainly weaken them, the core of the squad appears strong enough to challenge throughout the season. In theory, lost more firepower than they brought in during the close season, but Hugh Carthy should bring the team further joy throughout 2021, while it will be interesting to monitor the ongoing development of promising young American climber Neilson Powless. While Ruben Guerreiro and Sergio Higuita can help in the mountains, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Valgren will spearhead the spring classics campaign. Along with Italian climbs the Mortirolo Pass and Monte Zoncolan, the Alto de l'Angliru in Asturias in northern Spain is considered one of the toughest ascents in world cycling. And so when Carthy won stage 12 at the Vuelta a España on this mythical climb the entire world took notice. The manner in which the 193cm tall Prestonian dropped some of the best climbers in the race was as impressive as it was breathtaking. EF Education-Nippo will be hoping that new signing Valgren can rediscover his 2018 form. However, making his team debut at Étoile de Bessèges the Dane suffered a huge setback following a crash in which he sustained fractures to the second and third metacarpals in his left hand. France

 French national lottery Take away the wins from sprinter Arnaud Démare and Stefan Küng and Kevin Geniets' national titles and Groupama-FDJ were left with just three wins in 2020, the opening stage at Étoile de Bessèges for Alexys Brunel and a pair for young climber David Gaudu at the Vuelta a España. Given the team is essentially a state-sponsored vehicle to advertise the French national lottery — run by individuals that think and act as civil servants, according to French journalist François Thomazeau — it is unlikely Marc Madiot is under pressure to deliver better results in 2021, though most observers will be hoping he can. It is safe to say that last year's Tour de France was an unmitigated disaster after the team's main general classification hope Thibaut Pinot crashed on stage one, while his No 2 Gaudu was anonymous having arrived off the back of an illness. With a largely unchanged squad, Madiot will be hoping that Pinot can challenge in either the Tour, or if reports are to be believed, the Giro d'Italia while Démare will, surely, make his return to the Grande Boucle. Démare may also be targeting the spring classics, along with Swiss time-trial specialist Küng who managed top-10 finishes last year at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Ghent-Wevelgem and Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne. Having been omitted from the Tour squad, Démare went on to win four stages at the Giro along with the points jersey. It was his victory on stage six, though, that stood head and shoulders above the rest. On an uphill drag that favoured the likes of Michael Matthews or Peter Sagan, Démare went from some distance out to take the stage and underline why many argued he was the best all-round sprinter of 2020. Only time will tell if allowing the talented Frenchman Marc Sarreau to join Ag2r-Citroën was a mistake or not. However, having cut short his season following his involvement in the crash that did for fellow sprinter Fabio Jakobsen at last year's Tour of Poland, his condition is unknown. Great Britain

 Sir Dave Brailsford 
 Multinational chemicals company It was a peculiar year for the British team, but one which saw Ineos Grenadiers earn some new fans after adopting a new-look brand racing. Admittedly, their swashbuckling style was largely enforced on them after team leaders Egan Bernal and Geraint Thomas prematurely departed the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia respectively, but it was nonetheless a welcome approach from a team long associated with metronomic racing. Having strengthened with Laurens De Plus, Daniel Martínez, Richie Porte and Adam Yates, Ineos Grenadiers would appear more than prepared for the challenge laid down by Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates at last year's Tour de France. The addition of British neo-pro Tom Pidcock, meanwhile, should give the squad the option to liven things up in the early season one-day races, while another young Briton Ethan Hayter appears on course to make a name for himself in the classics. It will be interesting to see how the team management approach the new season: do they continue in the same vein as 2020, or revert to type? Whatever is decided, in Thomas, Bernal, Richard Carapaz and Geoghegan Hart — their four former grand tour winners — they have the firepower to contest the biggest stage races, and enough talent across to board to challenge in the Ardennes classics. Chris Froome may have left, but the team's conveyor belt of talent is showing no sign of coming to a halt. Having arrived at the Giro d'Italia as  for team-mate Geraint Thomas, Geoghegan Hart was installed as a 225-1 outsider to win his first grand tour when the Welshman crashed out just three days into the race. Two stage wins and a   — that he sealed on the final day — later and the Londoner joined the sport's immortals. It was one of the feelgood stories of not only the cycling season, but of the sporting year too. The capture of Pidcock is a massive coup for Ineos Grenadiers. Not only is he one of the most promising talents in the world right now, but also one of the most versatile and exciting riders of a generation. Targeting the Ardennes and hopes to makes his grand tour debut at the Vuelta a España. Belgium

 Belgian food retailer and engineering companies The newest kids on the WorldTour block, Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux, acquired their top-tier status having taken the licence from the now defunct CCC squad. They are also, on paper, one of the weakest. Despite having signed the vastly experienced Rein Taaramae (33), Jan Hirt (30), and Louis Meintjes (28), may struggle at making any sort of impact in the top level. However, will be hoping to challenge for stages and getting into breakaways during the Tour de France, and may even pick up the occasional win at the lower Continental level. Of the further additions — Jonas Koch, Baptiste Planckaert, Lorenzo Rota, Taco van der Hoorn, Riccardo Minali and Georg Zimmermann — it is the Dutchman Van der Hoorn that catches the eye most. The former Jumbo-Visma rider may have a short  with just the lesser known Schaal Sels one-day race on his list of wins, alongside the Primus Classic and a BinckBank Tour stage, but may be a source of victories for his new team. Taking just four wins in 2020, none of which were at WorldTour level, was not exactly inspiring stuff for the team. In fact, the biggest victory came from Xandro Meurisse who won a stage at the Vuelta a Murcia before he clinched the overall in the two-day race. Sadly, the Belgian all-rounder joined Alpecin-Fenix over the winter and so will not be repeating similar performances for Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux in 2021. Meintjes may have struggled since finishing eighth at the 2017 Tour, but the 28-year-old has an opportunity here to save his floundering career. Equally, having signed the South African climber on a one-year deal the team may have landed themselves an absolute steal. Israel

 Tel Aviv-based non-profit organisation Having finished bottom of the WorldTour pile in 2020, one imagines that when Israel Start-up Nation owner Sylvan Adams delivered his end-of-year report, the Canadian billionaire property developer will have insisted that in 2021, his riders and support staff 'must do better'. The capture of seven-time grand tour winner Chris Froome from Ineos Grenadiers that sparked a massive recruitment drive took the headlines, but the pressure will be on the 35-year-old who has not won a race since May 2018 to deliver the goods. The overall strengthening of the squad, however, should enable the team to make the required improvements. The arrivals of Sebastian Berwick, Patrick Bevin, Alessandro De Marchi, Carl Fredrik Hagen, Daryl Impey, Taj Jones, Sep Vanmarcke and Michael Woods will both offer support to Froome, while simultaneously add to the team's collective  A highly creditable eighth place at the 2019 Vuelta a España — between Wilco Kelderman and Marc Soler — highlights why Fredrik Hagen was wanted to help Froome in the mountains, while De Marchi ( ), Impey ( ), and Woods ( ) have all proved themselves at the highest level. Out of contract at the end of the season and expecting his first child, Alex Dowsett managed to get into the breakaway during stage eight at the Giro d'Italia. For some that may have been enough. Not Dowsett, not on this day. Having worked with team-mate Matthias Brändle, Dowsett escaped around 20km from the line before using his time trial skills to perfection and claim an emotional win for both rider and fans watching at home. He is the big-budget signing around which the team's Tour ambitions have been built, but can Froome buck the trend for youngsters winning and take home a record-equalling fifth  ? Whatever happens, following the Froome roadshow should be utterly engrossing. Holland

Five years later two monuments (Milan-Sanremo and Liège-Bastogne-Liège), a grand tour (Vuelta a España) and three stages at the Tour de France resulted in them becoming the No 1 ranked team in men's road cycling. It has been quite the transformation. May have lost a few  , but the arrivals of Edoardo Affini, Sam Oomen, Nathan Van Hooydonck should provide ample replacement.

Are fully expected, too, to be targeting the cobbled classics with Wout van Aert poised to resume hostilities with his cyclo-cross nemesis Mathieu van der Poel in what is turning into one of the great rivalries of the sport.

 Belgian national lottery and adhesives manufacturer Bolstered largely by Caleb Ewan's wins — the sprinter won two Tour de France stages, following two at the Tour Down Under and one apiece at the UAE Tour and the Tour de Wallonie before taking a magnificent seventh of the season at Scheldeprijs — only Matthew Holmes and Tim Wellens managed to take home any WorldTour wins in 2020. Whether or not it was fuelled by suffering their worst season in a decade, or not, an influx of young riders — all but one (Kamil Malecki, 25) are either 23 or under — gives the team a very new feel for 2021. It may also lead to them challenging for fewer races too, at least in the short-term. May need some of the older heads like Philippe Gilbert and John Degenkolb to step up during the spring classics, while Tim Wellens' form at Etoile de Bessèges, where he won a stage and the overall, would suggest the Belgian is in fine form in the countdown to the WorldTour. Although there were two stage wins at the Tour for Ewan along with two for Wellens at the Vuelta a España, it was an early-season victory from Holmes that stood out most. The Briton, competing in his first WorldTour race after joining from Madison-Genesis, did the improbable and ended Richie Porte's six-year reign on the Willunga Hill stage at the Tour Down Under. Holmes later impressed in breakaways at the Giro d'Italia. Having made wholesale changes, including bringing in five riders from their under-23 squad, the departure of Carl Fredrik Hagen to Israel Start-up Nation will likely cost them in the hillier stages. Appears, though, that Lotto-Soudal's plans are focused very much on the long-term. Spain

 Spanish mobile telephone company Given they lost Richard Carapaz, Mikel Landa and Nairo Quintana going into the year, and signed no fewer than 14 riders, last season was always going to be one of transition. Nobody, however, will have predicted that the oldest team in the WorldTour would have endured the worst year in their long and illustrious history since first forming as Reynolds in 1980. It is safe to say that for Movistar in 2021, things can only get better. While the once reliable Alejando Valverde, who at 40 is the oldest rider in the WorldTour, is starting to look his age, big things will be expected from Marc Soler. Enric Mas, meanwhile, will be hoping to build on his quietly impressive performances at last year's tours of France and Spain where he finished fifth, despite barely poking his nose into the wind. Big things, too, are expected from marquee signing Miguel Ángel López who arrives from Astana and will, presumably, form part of the team's two-pronged attack at the Tour de France alongside his new team-mate Mas. Although not widely heralded, the captures of Iván García Cortina and Gregor Mühlberger should give the squad an outlet in the spring classics, while also providing a couple of proven engines in the grand tours. Gonzalo Serrano arrives from Caja Rural-Seguros RGA while Abner González became the first Puerto Rican to ride in the WorldTour. It was an uncharacteristically poor season for Movistar who managed just two wins in the entire season, both coming from Soler. Having first won a stage at the Mallorca Challenge in February, the Spaniard landed a superb stage at the Vuelta a España after attacking on the descent off the final climb on stage two before soloing to victory. It came as a huge relief for the team, with the added bonus of the win being on their home roads. A year after a very public dispute at the Vuelta, ​Ángel López has joined the team he said was full of ""stupid people"". One imagines the pre-season training camp will have been interesting. Either way, Movistar have acquired a talented climber and proven stage winner. South Africa

 South African charity and Swiss cycling apparel Having lost their title sponsor late in 2020, Doug Ryder's squad was handed a reprieve from Swiss apparel brand Assos who already supplied the team with their kit. Though welcome, the deal came through too late to halt a mass exodus with the squad losing 15 riders to other teams while four retired. Coming in the other direction were 17 riders of varying experience from the under-23, Continental and WorldTour divisions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the team, kept hold of world hour record holder Victor Campenaerts, while the veteran climber Domenico Pozzovivo, now 38, has one year left on his contract. Giacomo Nizzolo will be hoping to regain the form he had before crashing out of last year's Tour de France just days after winning the European road title in Plouay. May rue the departure of Ben O'Connor to Ag2r-Citroën, but will be hoping the experience of new signings like Simon Clarke and Sergio Henao can help guide their new-look squad in the right direction. While there were some impressive wins for Italian sprinter Nizzolo, it was O'Connor's stage victory at the Giro that towered above the rest. A day after losing out to Jan Tratnik, the Australian who was out of contract at the end of the season, bounced back in the best possible way to land the biggest win of his career. Possibly a big mistake in not re-signing him. He may not have claimed a single race since the 2017 Tour when he won on La Planche des Belles Filles, but Fabio Aru may just be able to rebuild his career with Qhubeka-Assos. The 30-year-old has one year in which to do so as he enters what many are calling the last-chance saloon.

 US bicycle manufacturer and Italian coffee brand It was a mixed season for the team whose main general classification rider Vincenzo Nibali looked his age (36) at the Giro d'Italia, while another, Bauke Mollema, crashed out of the Tour de France with a broken wrist. It was not all doom and gloom, however. Richie Porte finished third at the Tour — the best result of his career — and world champion Mads Pedersen managed to show off the rainbow stripes in Paris. The early-season win from Jasper Stuyven at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad was hugely impressive, while wins from Pedersen at the Tour of Poland, BinckBank Tour and Ghent-Wevelgem along with the return to the fold of Quinn Simmons — who was suspended after the 2019  junior world champion posted “divisive” and “incendiary” tweets — would suggest that it is the one-day classics where the squad's strengths may lie in 2021. Though not in the WorldTour, Matteo Moschetti twice got the better of Pascal Ackermann with wins at the Mallorca Challenge, leading to many saying the 24-year-old can challenge in the big sprints. Very quiet in the transfer market, signing just Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier from the WorldTour while three under-23 riders —  Jakob Egholm, Mattias Skjelmose Jensen, Antonio Tiberi — also joined the squad. Having book-ended his maiden Tour with two second place finishes, Pedersen did what few had predicted and got the better of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert at Ghent-Wevelgem. Benefiting from the pair's refusal to commit in the finale, the young Dane proved yet again he was both a supremely talented and canny rider as he won his first semi-classic after outsprinting Florian Sénéchal and Matteo Trentin to the line. Having finally made the podium at a grand tour at last year's Tour, the 36-year-old Richie Porte will ride for his former paymasters Ineos Grenadiers in 2021. The departure of the solid professional — though not a seasoned winner in the big races — may be a big loss in the grand tours. UAE

 José Antonio Fernández 
 Emirates The Emirati-owned squad with the Italian heart enjoyed its greatest season yet in terms of both number of wins and, perhaps more importantly, the quality of wins. Stages in all three grand tours, along with the biggest prize of them all — the fabled yellow jersey for winning the Tour de France — propelled the squad into whole new stratosphere. Along with Ineos Grenadiers and Jumbo-Visma, UAE Team Emirates are now expected to challenge for the biggest honours in world cycling. The arrival of Rafal Majka should give Tadej Pogacar more support when he needs it most — the young Slovenian cannot expect to defend his Tour title without having to do some of the heavy lifting in 2021 — while Matteo Trentin will bring some much-needed experience. The surprise signing of Marc Hirschi, meanwhile, will both take the pressure off Pogacar while also, on paper, assuring his new paymasters some big wins. Was a big surprise to see young Belgian sprinter Jasper Philipsen leave for Alpecin-Fenix, but armed with Fernando Gaviria and the evergreen Alexander Kristoff should have enough to challenge in the sprints and one-day classics. Another one to watch will be Brandon McNulty, 22, who finished 15th on his grand tour debut at last year's Giro d'Italia. Pogacar's performance in the penultimate day time trial of the Tour was one of the most astonishing days in the history of the world's biggest bike race. For Pogacar, his performance was career-defining; for his rival and compatriot Primoz Roglic heartbreaking. A day after winning on La Planche des Belles Filles, Pogacar became the second youngest winner in the Tour's history dating back to 1903. Put simply: it was unbelievable. Hirschi's arrival from Sunweb was not only the biggest transfer of UAE Team Emirates' close season, but of the entire WorldTour also. Indeed, it was reported by  that his new employers multiplied his salary by 14 — from around €70,000 to €1 million. But can he deliver?

37,How Everton's paltry attacking output could see them miss out on Europe,"Everton fans are positively  he has given them their first league win at Liverpool for 22 years, a season-long challenge for the European places and a general sense of progression with a A closer look at their football however, reveals Everton are a long way from being considered serious Champions League candidates. After a home match against Crystal Palace and a trip to Brighton they face Tottenham, Arsenal, Aston Villa and West Ham in successive Premier League games. They could be in an uphill battle to finish in the top eight, which would be a disappointing conclusion to a promising season.  The first problem Everton need to address is their home form. They are fourth in the away table with nine wins from 14 games, but 15th in the home equivalent  . Ancelotti's team have lost home fixtures against Fulham, Newcastle and Burnley.  This poor record reflects the fact Everton struggle to put teams under sustained pressure. Everton are averaging just 9.8 shots-per-game, their second lowest total in a Premier League season since records began in 1997-98. Only Burnley, Crystal Palace, Sheffield United and West Brom take fewer shots per game.  Everton fare slightly better when it comes to expected goals, testament to Dominic Calvert-Lewin's talent for getting high-quality chances in the six-yard box, but their output is still pretty mediocre. Their average of 1.22 xG per game puts them 12th in the rankings, behind West Ham, Leeds, Brighton, Aston Villa, Tottenham and Arsenal.  They have relied on the efficiency of Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison to score 40 league goals from a season-long xG tally of 34.14. Everton's shot conversion rate is 14.7 per cent, their highest in a Premier League season since 1997-98. Is that sustainable?  Their defensive statistics are not particularly impressive, in the bottom half for shots conceded, shots on target conceded and xG conceded.  Big name appointments give fans comfort, but are Everton really going anywhere? There are certainly positives. Ben Godfrey has proved an excellent purchase at the back, precisely the kind of young talent Everton should be targeting, and they have one of the best strike partnerships around in Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin who are the right age at 23 and 24.  The concern is Everton went big on Allan, James Rodriguez and Abdoulaye Doucoure last summer - 30, 29 and 28 respectively - yet central midfield still looks an area lacking intensity out of possession and quality on the ball.  Ancelotti is not a great builder of teams and clubs; his best work has been fine-tuning squads filled with elite players. Everton fans love having the Italian as their manager, but whether he is exactly what they need remains an unanswered question. ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/evertons-paltry-attacking-output-could-see-miss-europe/
38,From turbo-charged teen to 'Senior Man': How Kelechi Iheanacho realised his potential,"He was once the Manchester City teenager regarded as the crown jewel of their academy, and Kelechi Iheanacho is now the ‘Senior Man’ for Leicester City. The new nickname is a Nigerian tribute to Iheanacho’s recent impact, with seven goals in his past four matches, and there is little doubt that the forward is in the best form of his career ahead of the meeting with his former club on Saturday evening. As Leicester pursue a return to the Champions League, Iheanacho has struck gold at the perfect moment. The £25 million signing is finally delivering what Leicester expected, and Manchester City’s academy coaches had always predicted, injecting fresh impetus into Brendan Rodgers’s season and easing the  On Friday morning he was named as the winner of March's Premier League player of the month award. Negotiations over a new contract have already started and should be concluded soon, a fitting reward for a player who has arguably suffered only because of Vardy's brilliance. With Leicester previously so dependent on Vardy, their undisputed talisman, Iheanacho has proved that he can effectively operate alongside him and allowed Rodgers to be more tactically flexible. He is a hugely popular figure in Leicester’s dressing room, insisting that every team-mate, physio and coach signed the matchball after  .  In a post-match interview after that game, he also dedicated his treble to all mothers in the world. It was a particularly poignant moment, as his own mother, Mercy, passed away in 2013 after a brief illness. His goal celebrations always include a salute to the heavens. Selfless, humble, and unfailingly polite, Iheanacho also refused to take all the credit for his stunning volley at Burnley, claiming it was only possible due to Vardy’s run taking defenders away. Operating in the pockets in front of the midfield and behind Vardy, Iheanacho has finally found a role that seems to suit him.  In the past, he has been employed mainly as a lone striker in Vardy’s absence but the past few weeks have underlined that he is far better suited playing in a front-two. “He’s full of confidence and when any player does that you can play to a high level,” said Rodgers. “He’s come here for a big fee with one of the league’s best strikers already at the club so there has been adaptation for him. His work and ambition to be a better player is always there and whatever role he’s been asked to play he’s done it very well. “I’m a manager who likes to develop players and when you see that improvement it makes you really satisfied.” Perhaps the biggest surprise is that it has taken Iheanacho so long to spark his Leicester career into life. Breaking into the first-team from Manchester City’s academy at the age of 18, he was tipped as one of four future superstars alongside Jadon Sancho, Phil Foden and Brahim Diaz, by chairman Khaldoon al-Muburak. Iheanacho was highly admired by Manuel Pellegrini, with the sales of Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic a result of the club’s confidence in the young Nigerian. In his first season, he scored 14 goals which included a hat-trick at Aston Villa in the FA Cup. After the game he was ambushed by the entire squad in the Villa Park away dressing room, with the players serenading him with the chant which had been newly created by the club’s supporters. Though Pep Guardiola had high hopes for him, the offer from Leicester in August 2017 was too good to turn down. , which has now expired, due to their trust in his potential. At times, that fee has undoubtedly weighed on Iheanacho’s shoulders and he has only impressed sporadically under first Craig Shakespeare and then Claude Puel. There have been numerous occasions when rival Premier League clubs, and teams abroad, have attempted to sign him on loan due to a lack of opportunities. Yet Rodgers has proven the difference, with his man-management and tactical nous bringing the best out of the 24 year old.  Iheanacho is now unquestionably a key part of Rodgers’s plans for the final two months of the season, with the FA Cup semi-final against Southampton also looming in April. ‘Senior Man Kelz’ is coming of age, and Leicester are only benefiting.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/turbo-charged-teen-senior-man-kelechi-iheanacho-realised-potential/
39,What it was really like to line up against Jonah Lomu - from those who did it,"By far the most compelling difference between Ireland and New Zealand in 1995 was Jonah – he was exceptional that day and he just got better,  It was not the case that we knew about him. This was 1995, pre-video analysis, and in Ireland we relied on whatever southern hemisphere rugby the BBC broadcast – which was scant. Around that time you might have got some highlights from the Hong Kong Sevens or something. Before the World Cup, Lomu had not really broken into the All Blacks team but had made his mark at schoolboy and Sevens level. So, in terms of exposure in the media – there was none. In terms of video analysis in my day and the days of early professionalism – none of that was there in 1995. So we didn’t really know anything about him! I would have gone into the game totally blindsided if it hadn’t been for a journalist. We were staying in the Sunnyside Park hotel in Johannesburg and to get to the team room you had to walk through a terrace that you could access from outside the hotel. I walked through doors of the hotel to be accosted by this journalist – I can’t remember who – two days before the game. He asked to have a quick chat and, long before the days where the media were segregated from the players, I said no problem. We started chatting and more or less off the bat he says: ‘So you’re up against Jonah Lomu in a few days’ time – what are your thoughts?’ And I really didn’t have any! I said something along the lines of: ‘You know, he’s an All Black wing and all All Black wings I’ve come across have been great so I have no doubt that he’s going to provide stern opposition.’ Straightaway the journalist realised that I had no idea who Jonah was or, at least, his potential. So he says three things to me and with each phrase my pallor changed. It started with him telling me that he’s 6ft 4ins and I thought, ‘Ok, he’s tall, so?’. Then he said he does the 100 metres in 10.5 seconds and I thought, ‘Ok, tall, lanky, quick – I’ve played against guys like Nigel Walker, for example, who was an Olympic sprinter and if you got your angles right you could deal with them’.  And then he dropped the clanger. ‘He’s 19 stone,’ he said. I must have gone pale. I had no idea how to react to this so I just said, ‘the bigger they are, the harder they fall’. And, of course, he never fell. My first contact with him came when we fly-hacked the ball away from our 22 and it went straight into Jonah’s hands. I pushed up, he ran at me and I thought, ‘here is a big lad running at me, I know what he’s going to do – he’s going to run over the top of me.’ So I went in to make the tackle and tried to anticipate his weight coming in and fall back with him and hopefully drag him down that way. But he had other plans. He stepped me and, before I knew it, I was off balance on the ground and he was scoring under the posts. I didn’t have too many one-on-ones with him, however, as they kept using him in the midfield. Thankfully my reputation wasn’t hugely affected by his prowess! He was so much more powerful. His quads were twice the size of mine – Jesus. It was like getting into a ring with a super-heavyweight.  But I didn’t feel inadequate afterwards, I was more in awe. We had just witnessed a phenomenal, once-in-a-lifetime athlete. A few years later, Ireland played a World XV in the ‘Peace International’ just after the Good Friday agreement. I was having a beer after the match with Eric Rush, the New Zealand Sevens legend, and he asked me if I had sent a fax to Jonah before that 1995 match.  I said, ‘what do you mean?’ And he said that Jonah received a fax from me, from our hotel, saying that I was going to do all sorts of things to him and make a fool of him on the pitch. And, for the second time with regard to Jonah Lomu, the blood drained from my face. Obviously I hadn’t and implored Eric to go back to New Zealand and talk to anyone remotely interested in rugby – so, the whole population – and please impress upon them that I did not do any such thing. Jonah did find out that it wasn’t me, eventually. He said he thought it was one of my friends who did it as a prank. Well, they wouldn’t be much of a friend… Maybe it was someone from the NZRFU? From their point of view maybe he was too relaxed and maybe they were trying to really get him going, to make him more aggressive. But, God, they really didn’t need to do that. I think the fact that   is testament to what it’s like to face him.  Without wishing to sound dismissive about the preparation, the tournament was very much one of the first occasions he had burst onto the scene. He had played some Tri-Nations stuff before the World Cup and then played excellently against Ireland and Scotland, but this was 1995 – it was amateur. Your ability to be able to study these things or embrace the level that the game is at now in preparing to face opposition teams was very different. We were almost victims of our own success the week before when we beat Australia in the quarter-final. It was a massive victory against the world champions; a lot of the 1995 squad had played in the 1991 final that Australia won and it had hurt them. There was a lot of animosity between the two teams. David Campese was a major character and ego in their team, and very vocal with it.  So, with that win, and such a good win, we almost felt like we’d done it. We felt like we could almost walk home with our heads held high. There was a lot of friction between the RFU and the England team – the RFU ‘old farts’ stuff hadn’t quite gone away. So that was still going on. But the RFU was wealthy and, almost as an olive branch to us, they whisked us up to Sun City, almost as an unplanned celebration. But that impacted our preparation for New Zealand. The leadership group were uncertain about going. But they felt it might be good to get a break from the monotony of what was going on as we’d been in South Africa for quite a few weeks by that point. We were probably up there too long and it was too late by the time we came back down – figuratively as well as geographically… So, how did we prepare for it? An element of overconfidence. We’d won a Grand Slam and we’d just beaten the world champions. We had a couple of iffy group games which weren’t fantastic but we beat an Argentina pack that was recognised as a real force, so we headed into the game with a lot of confidence. We felt as if we had the upper-hand up front. I wasn’t in the selection meeting but from what I understand it was quick and they kept the same team. In terms of my preparation, there’s not a lot you can physically do in a few days leading up to a game. I couldn’t pile on a few more stone; I couldn’t suddenly learn to be a better defender, which wasn’t the best part of my game anyway, so that wasn’t going to change; and there wasn’t really an element of changing the game plan either to think about specifically how we’d deal with Jonah. It was 25 years ago so I will apologise now to Jack, Les, Will and John Elliott, and anyone else in the squad who might have had a conversation throughout the week, but I don’t recall conversations about Jonah ever happening. I recall a conversation asking if I felt OK about it and, well, what was I supposed to say? I was feeling good and I wanted to play in a semi-final of the World Cup. I had to go in with utmost confidence and think that because he’s a big man, if I get some space then I should take advantage of being the smaller man with a bit more manoeuvrability. Unfortunately, I never really got that. Collectively and as a team we had been shocked by him, not just (Mike) Catty and me. It was guys up front; some of our bigger, better defenders in the pack that were getting bumped by him, too. Such strength added to such speed and agility. But I didn’t really dwell on it – after, we did the Pizza Hut advert, for those who remember. In the aftermath, my focus wasn’t on Jonah. For me, my process had to be taking ownership of the fact that I had had this… not humiliation, but I’d been made to look and feel insignificant and I was totally ‘out-physicalled’. It was about to become my profession, and if I wanted to continue playing at the top of the game I had to go through a personal journey of my own, so the focus couldn’t be on Jonah, it had to be on how I moved forward and handled – to a certain extent – the crisis that I was facing at that time. My confidence took a big hit and I had to turn that around. There was absolutely a lot of soul-searching. The team talk preparing to play against him was really simple: absolutely do everything we can to give him no time and space. I’ve been in Canterbury and Crusader teams where we have done it really well. So we would always prepare to get up and shut him down before he got moving. We knew if we gave him time and space, that power… We had games against Jonah where our plan worked, and we had games against him where it didn’t matter what plan we had, he could just steamroll us. Him and Joeli Vidiri at Lancaster Park against Counties Manukau for a home semi-final, they put 17 points on us in about five minutes. They absolutely dominated the game, dominated the collisions and we couldn’t stop them. Trying to defend him on the blindside as a flanker? We just tried to make sure that we had a steady scrum and put their set piece under pressure. Rather than having to deal with him, try and put their scrum and half-back under pressure so they get s--- ball and they can’t attack from it. Try not to give him the ball on the front foot because if we did that it was tough. But playing with him was so good. I always felt more likely to win with him on my team – he was that much of a presence. And he was always well respected as a man of character – he was a great guy. He always gave a lot to his team and he was a great team-mate.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/11/18/really-like-line-against-jonah-lomu-did/
40,'He just kept going': Graham Gooch's 333 remembered by the players at Lord's 30 years ago,"As a teenage cricket nut – and Essex fan – July 27, 1990 was a huge day for me. My first proper visit to Lord’s for a big-time Test match. And what a day it turned out to be, as my idol Graham Gooch forged on from his overnight 194 not out to reach 333, still the highest Test score ever made on the ground. Thirty years on, I spoke to three of the England players in that team – Gooch himself, David Gower and Angus Fraser – while Vijay Lokapally interviewed five members of the India side.  We had had a shocker in the Ashes the previous summer, when the ball had a ropelike seam. In 1990, it was the opposite: smaller seam, flatter pitches, millions of runs all around the country. But Mohammad Azharuddin still put us in!  It can be difficult when you win the toss at Lord’s. If the overhead conditions are heavy, the ball can move around a lot. It was a bit like that in this case. The wicket is also at its slowest on the first day, so you just try to play solidly and get through to lunch with one or two down.  We got Mike Atherton cheaply. I had come first-change and was getting late swing. I should have had Gooch early but he was dropped by wicketkeeper Kiran More on just 36. He nicked even as he was trying to leave the ball. If you give a chance to batsmen like Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Steve Waugh, you only suffer. Gooch comes in that category. It was the costliest missed catch ever. I never played another Test.  I don’t know how I spilled it. Ten times out of ten I would have taken the catch. But it was the first hour and the ball deviated slightly and it just slipped away. Lucky git! Meanwhile I was given out caught at silly point when I didn’t touch it! Then I sat and watched Wimbledon for the next two days, only getting up six times to applaud Graham’s landmarks. Not that he celebrated them much. He was never going to wear himself out by raising his bat too vigorously. But seriously, once he had got past that chance, there is this thing about the big run-scorers: they just keep going. It is a tribute to fitness, concentration, determination. That’s what you call leading from the front.  Gooch knew how to bat on that pitch. The Lord’s slope threw a challenge and we could not cope with his tactics. He just kept flicking and on-driving us and by the time we realised it was too late. He was comfortably picking the runs and in no time he had his 200. I've never seen a batsmen play so many pulls in an innings. Probably we pitched it too short. Plus, none of us could bowl bouncers. Gooch was simply too good in that entire series.  Between 1987 and 1989, my game was not at its best. Terry Alderman exposed that in the 1989 Ashes. So I consulted Geoff Boycott, my opening partner from ten years earlier. I had good memories of when we played together, and I went back to that style in terms of set-up. And then with the captaincy coming back to me after that Ashes series defeat, everything just clicked. It was a double whammy. Those were the most productive years of my career, at an age when most people are probably past their best. [Gooch had turned 37 that same week.]  If you take away the chance he earned, it was an unblemished performance. Gooch has always been one of my favourite batsmen. He never called me by my name. “Master” he would call me. [Gooch has no memory of this, saying “I thought I always called him ‘Azhar’.”] He was smashing our bowlers around but you couldn’t take your eyes off his masterly show even though he was hurting us. There are times when you admire your opponent. Gooch was one such batsman. He played the on-drive to perfection. His sweep shot was always lethal. Our bowlers discovered the hard way in that Test. It was Gooch versus us really.  Once they stuck us in, they never looked like getting wickets, so we were just putting our feet up and enjoying the Lord’s hospitality. Allan Lamb and Robin Smith made hundreds too. You’ve got friends inviting you to one of the boxes, and you’re free as a player to go in and out, catch up with a few people in the corporate box, have lunch with your family in one of the suites. It was a relaxed environment. You went and did that knowing you wouldn’t be needed for some time.  People always mention about the BBC going off air on the second day to show racing [the 4.05pm from Ascot], just as I was about to get to 300. I was a bit nervous, so I probably slowed down then. But then, when I made it past, I was looking to tee off, make some quick runs ahead of the declaration. As it was, I was running out of petrol. After I was out [bowled through the gate by Prabhakar], Mickey [Stewart, the team manager] gave me a mild bollocking. He told me “What did you get out for? You should have got the record!” [The highest Test score was then Sir Garry Sobers’s 365, one ahead of Len Hutton’s still extant England record of 364.]  We made 650-odd but it wasn’t easy when we came to bowl. Azharuddin played one of the best innings I’ve seen – a stunning hundred off 80-odd balls. He was the second-best player I ever bowled at after Brian Lara. If you put it on off stump, he would hit you through midwicket. Then, if you bowled three inches wider, he’d slap you through backward point.  I was feeling good right from the first ball. After the [1989] tour to Pakistan, I had changed my grip and decided to bat more aggressively. You can say it was a once-in-a-lifetime knock for me. I was under pressure for having put England in. So, I had to make amends and prove a point. I actually found Fraser easy to handle because he made you play every ball. I like bowlers who make you play every ball. You had to watch out, though, because he was so accurate. He bowled a splendid line, close to the wicket, slight movement. He troubled the batsmen right through the series. I think he was the difference.  Since you ask, yes, I did nip in with a wicket [Sanjay Manjrekar, caught behind for 18.] I hope the poor guy didn’t take it too hard! But the attack was built around Gus. He liked to give it the old teapot, moaning away, but he was at his peak around that time. I thought I had caught Kapil off him at second slip, straight in. Unfortunately, there were no replays in those days. You had to wait for the umpire’s decision, and when Nigel Plews asked Dickie Bird – who was at square-leg – Dickie said “I can’t help you, Nigel”. Then Kapil hit Eddie Hemmings for four sixes in four balls, all into the building site at the Nursery End, to save the follow-on. It was all the more frustrating because, as soon as we got Kapil off strike, Gus finished the innings with the next ball.  Honestly, had it been five wickets in hand I wouldn’t have tried. We were the last pair and I had no choice but to hit. The follow-on was staring at us. The first two sixes I did plan, but the third and fourth happened because of the flow. And I could do that because I thought I was in a good nick. I kept telling Hiru [legspinner Narendra Hirwani] “Let us do it in singles”, only to mislead the bowlers! I just waited, and grabbed the chance when it became desperate.  I was not a happy bunny. I went back out to the wicket with impetus, spitting feathers. When you have a sniff of a chance, you have to drive it home. I was brought up with Mike Brearley and Keith Fletcher. In county cricket, you can’t get points sitting in the pavilion.  Gooch was not the batsman who would get bogged down. He loved to stay positive. He had got a hundred against us on a seaming pitch in 1986 [114 at Lord’s]. It was as good as any. Gooch was the best opener I have played against. Few could read the conditions like he did. Mentally tough, sound temperament, brilliant batting skills with his upright stance. He started that trend of holding the bat high. Never heard him speak when he was at the crease. He would just bat and bat and bat. A good man.  I was reminded of his hundred in the 1987 World Cup [semi-final] when he swept us out of the tournament. He was tough to bowl to when in such nick. To me, the 123 [which made Gooch the highest individual run-scorer in a single Test – a record which still stands] is the bigger achievement. So many people would have settled for having made a triple-century in the first innings, and not worried about the second. But by that stage of his career, Graham had worked out what he needed to do to make runs in big quantities, each and every day. And if he forgot for a moment, being captain reminded him. Far from being a burden, it spurred him on to greater things. This whole Test was a testimony to the ultimate professional, then at the top of his game.  I certainly never looked at the captaincy as a burden. I looked at it as an honour – the thing you remember most about your career. No individual performance can compare with being asked to lead your country. You’re not just making the decisions; you’re at the top of the pyramid of your whole sport. It’s up to you to show the way, because everyone looks to you for an example.  When they batted again, I remember that I got Sachin Tendulkar [then 17 years old and playing the eighth of his 200 Tests]. Some batsmen are unrecognisable between the start of their career and the finish. But Tendulkar has exactly the same beginning and end: strong off the legs, back-foot drives, cuts and stuff. If he has tinkered with his technique, it’s not noticeable on the eye.  After all that effort, it was satisfying that we finished it off by bowling them out. Hemmings chipped in with a couple of wickets. He was a bloody good bowler, as I always realised when I played against Nottinghamshire. Put real fizz on the ball, good loop, a lot of revs. A professional stroppy bugger too – although if you got him away from the environment, you realised it wasn’t all real. His stroppiness was part of an act, the same sort of act as my laidbackness. I guess we were both RADA trained!  I always playfully rib Gooch over the fact that it’s known as his match but I won the game by taking eight wickets. No-one remembers that. The batsmen go out there and fill their boots on a flat one, but it’s only seen as being a great match because we won. Still, that’s just me being a big-headed twat. In fact, Gooch finished it all off with a run-out from mid-off.  There’s a photo of the middle stump out of the ground. Direct hit. It was their third seamer [Sharma]. He would have thought “That fella’s not going to run me out. He’s an old man!”  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2020/07/27/just-kept-going-graham-goochs-333-remembered-players-lords/
41,"Questor: in the last chance saloon, India Capital Growth’s managers have delivered","Few investment trusts can boast a tripling in their share price in the space of just a year. While   is able to make this rare claim, it has been a rollercoaster ride for investors none the less. Even before Covid-19 sent global stock markets into a tailspin last spring, the trust’s performance had disappointed. The market in which it invests, small and medium-sized Indian stocks, had performed badly, the trust’s own holdings had underperformed this market and the discount had widened substantially. Things then went from bad to worse as the pandemic took hold. While Indian small and medium-sized shares fell by 30pc in March last year,  . This caused its discount to balloon to 42pc in April. With things looking dire, the board gave the trust’s manager, Ocean Dial, 18 months to turn performance around and offered investors the option to redeem some or all of their shares at a maximum discount of 6pc by the end of 2021 and every two years thereafter. As the trust was trading on a 34pc discount at the time, this provided an attractive exit route – and it was for this reason that Questor, which had initially tipped the trust in March 2017, advised readers not to sell. The good news is that, 10 months on, the outlook for India Capital Growth is looking brighter. Performance has turned around: the underlying portfolio has returned 93pc over the past year, according to Numis, the broker. What’s more, the discount has narrowed to 12pc. This can be attributed to a repositioning of the portfolio and a rebound by the Indian stock market since the country came out of lockdown last June. Since then, the economy has continued to show signs of recovery and has remained open. Even in light of the trust’s improved performance, Daniel Lockyer, a fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said he believed it had further to go. “From here I expect to see some great opportunities because the economic conditions are positive,” he said. “The population has largely escaped the worst of Covid: although India still has a lot of cases, the deaths and restrictions are less than in many other countries. The government has put in a very stimulative budget and corporate earnings are also positive and growing nicely.” Mr Lockyer also highlighted the potential gain on offer if investors chose to participate in the share redemption at the end of the year. “Ideally we want the share price to go up to the net asset value, but even if it goes the other way you still have a 6pc margin of error from where we are today,” he said. This could present adventurous investors with an opportunity to make money in nine months’ time. However, given how much India Capital Growth’s discount has narrowed over the past 10 months, it would be remiss of Questor to describe it as a screaming buy. We'll stick with a hold rating. Investors in   received 12.5pc of their investment back at near par value in early February – not a bad outcome given that the trust was trading at an 11pc discount at the time. The redemption was under the trust’s policy to repurchase shares when assets exceed £100m to retain a focus on Britain’s smallest listed companies. This policy can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. If the trust is trading at a premium you will be forced to sell your shares at a lower price and there are potential tax implications too. However, while the trust trades at a discount there are opportunities to benefit from an uplift: and it would appear that another return of capital could be on the cards in light of the fund’s strong recent performance. Over the past six months alone the underlying portfolio has gained 39pc. A spokesman for N+1 Singer, the trust’s broker, said the board had historically returned capital when assets were in the £115m to £120m range. With gross assets close to £115m, he said another redemption looked likely if good performance continued. As the trust trades at a 7.5pc discount, this presents an attractive support for the valuation. ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/funds/questor-last-chance-saloon-india-capital-growths-managers-have/

43,The unstoppable rise of the 'super shoe' - and how it caused 'mayhem' in athletics,"By the start of 2020, it was evident something was afoot. By World Athletics president Seb Coe’s admission, the governing body had “been chasing the horse around the paddock” in failing to react quickly enough to developments in road-running shoes and it was too late. Nike’s technological innovations had changed the marathon landscape forever and no elite runner would ever take the start line again without some combination of carbon fibre and hyper-responsive foam under the soles of their feet. The horse had bolted. Now the governing body had a secondary problem of attempting to shut the door on the same happening on the track. Little more than a year on, its failure to do so has been brought into sharp focus and threatened to overshadow much of what will take place at the Olympics this summer. Courtesy of previously unheralded athletes making headlines with astounding performances during the indoor season, fissures that had been bubbling under the surface have developed into full-blown divisions as debate blights the sport and world records become sitting ducks. Behind it lies a secretive world of non-disclosure agreements, cutting-edge technology and warring shoe companies, battling to help runners achieve feats many thought impossible. Many people, including some within the footwear industry, believe it should never have come to this. Until January 2020, regulations on sole thickness had only ever existed in the high jump and long jump, with most track spikes so thin and lightweight that further limitations were not necessary. But with shoe companies seeing the radical impact of marrying carbon-fibre plates with super-springy foam, prototypes for middle- and long-distance track spikes had emerged a few months earlier at the 2019 World Championships that suggested all that was about to change and limitations were quickly needed. Where track spikes had rarely exceeded 15 millimetres in thickness in the past, World Athletics introduced a blanket 30mm sole thickness rule, later amended to 25mm for all track events beyond 400 metres. The reason for not going thinner was the existence of one particular thick-soled Nike spike rarely worn outside the American collegiate system. “That was what created everything you see now,” one leading shoe company executive told  . “It means you have all this room for plates and bounceability. “The parameters are out of control. They should never have been what they are, but now we have them we are going to work with them. “We’re going to have a period of two or three years where you have phenomenal athletes - let’s not belittle them - that are given a product that is definitely going to make them run faster. There will be faster times and records falling. In the short term it’s going to be mayhem.” Barely an athletics competition has gone by this year without proof. Fresh from new women’s 5,000m, and men’s 5,000m and 10,000m world records during last year’s brief outdoor season, the past month has seen times continue to tumble in middle and long-distance events. One men’s 3,000m race saw a 23-year-old world record missed by just 0.08 seconds as the first four Nike-sponsored finishers all moved into the top eight of the all-time world rankings. Nike-sponsored British athlete Elliot Giles, who has never reached a world final, smashed Coe’s national 800m record by more than a second with the second-fastest indoor time in history. And Nike-sponsored Marc Scott took 46 seconds off his 10,000m personal best to move second behind only Mo Farah on the all-time British rankings. For many people - and no one more than the athletes themselves - the astonishing performances are reflective of hard work in training, the rare benefit of time during global Covid lockdowns, and peaking at the start of an Olympic year. But all have revolutionary shoes as a common factor. The fast times of the past are destined to be consigned to history. As Geoff Burns, a biomechanics expert at the University of Michigan, says: “It’s like there are these gems that through all of our history we thought were super rare but now we’ve found a deposit of them that makes them a little bit less valuable. “This year will be the equivalent of the move from cinder to all-weather tracks. It’s a generational shift.” Olympian and scientist Shalaya Kipp knew she was witnessing something that would change the marathon picture forever the moment she began “top-secret” testing of the latest Nike prototype road-running shoes. It was early 2016 and the first edition of what would become the Nike Vaporfly 4% was being put through its paces at the University of Colorado. Kipp, along with everyone else in the laboratory, was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, preventing loose tongues causing details of the secret shoe to emerge. “We started referring to the prototype as ‘The Magic’ in the lab because it was crazy,” says Kipp. “It improved the running economy of every single participant we put in these shoes. It didn’t matter if they hated the shoe or not. The smallest change we saw was two per cent and the biggest six per cent.” There were two key components that marked the shoe out for such controversial greatness: a carbon-fibre plate and a new super-responsive foam. While the former was nothing new in isolation - carbon-fibre plates had been used in road-running shoes for well over a decade - it was the interaction with the new Pebax foam (which Nike called ZoomX) that changed everything. “For a long time we had EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foams and they were pretty bad,” explains Wouter Hoogkamer, assistant biomechanics professor at the University of Massachusetts. “They were either soft and so you lost all the energy, or they had to be made really firm so you didn’t lose it. The result was minimal thicknesses for road shoes and track spikes. “Adidas came along with Boost foam around 2013, which allowed a softer foam that gave more energy return. Now with the Pebax foam you have even more of that.” A few months after the laboratory testing, the men’s Olympic marathon produced a Nike podium clean sweep through Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge, Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia and American Galen Rupp. Disguised to look like the rest of the existing Nike footwear range, all three men were in fact secretly wearing the Vaporfly 4% prototype. “We were watching and knew exactly what was going on,” says Kipp. What happened next is well-known. Almost every podium at every major marathon between 2017 and 2019 was filled by Nike-sponsored athletes in Vaporfly 4% and Next% shoes, with some athletes affiliated to other companies attempting to paint over the Nike branding after jumping ship to use their rival’s shoes. Kipchoge would first smash the world record in 2018, before donning the latest iteration of the shoe - the Alphafly - to become the first man to run a marathon in less than two hours, albeit under highly-controlled conditions. Nike athlete Brigid Kosgei also obliterated Paula Radcliffe’s longstanding women’s marathon world record. Athletes running in rival shoes simply stood no chance. “It was guns versus knives,” says Burns. Asked for their reaction to such inequality, Nike make no apologies for their ability to produce better shoes than their rivals. “Plates, foam and air are not new ingredients in running shoes or spikes, we’re just smarter about how we engineer and assemble them,” a spokesperson told  . Four years on, the situation is rather different, with other shoe companies catching up. Three of the four winners at last December’s Valencia Marathon and Half-Marathon wore the Adizero Adios Pro, which uses carbon-infused rods laid out to mimic the skeleton under the forefoot, and a carbon-fibre plate in the heel. One of the athletes, Kibiwott Kandie, broke the half-marathon world record. After years of a mismatch between Nike road-running shoes and the rest, New Balance, Reebok, Saucony, On, Brooks, Hoka and Asics have now all released their own ‘super shoes’. The playing field is distorted from history, but it once again vaguely resembles something level among current athletes. “There really hasn’t been a ton of innovation in track products for a long time,” says Danny Orr, New Balance general manager for running technology. “It’s always been a little bit around, ‘can it weigh as little as possible’ and, ‘can it have as much traction as possible’. “For as long as I’ve been doing this, that’s all that has come the way of track athletes. So it does feel for the first time in 20 years there’s innovation in this space, which is exciting.” While the outside world was  , shoe companies had realised the technological advances could now be used to conquer the second frontier of track athletics. Prototypes, primarily from Nike, using the same technology began appearing with semi-regularity after Rupp is believed to have worn a pair in finishing fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics. By the 2019 World Championships, the finished product was almost complete with a number of Nike athletes - including gold medal winners Sifan Hassan and Donavan Brazier - producing outstanding performances in prototype shoes that would later turn into the Air Zoom Victory, with its carbon-fibre plate and air pod, and ZoomX Dragonfly, which features a rigid Pebax plate. World Athletics had a decision to make. Track competition was on the brink of following road running, which had been blighted by accusations of technological doping. The question was whether the sport should follow the lead of swimming, which banned Speedo’s shark-inspired suits that saw world records tumble in 2008, or the likes of cycling, which encourages innovations in bikes, suits and helmets. An added factor for the governing body was balancing what many perceived as the integrity of pure competition against the requirements of the shoe companies that provide athletics its main source of income. “There is a built-in dynamic, where shoe companies mercifully are still investing a lot of money into the research and development of shoes,” said Coe, who relinquished a long-term Nike ambassadorial role in 2015. “I’m pleased they are doing that.” Under pressure from Nike, World Athletics opted for a 20mm sole thickness limit on events up to 400m and 25mm for longer distances. “They didn’t need to go to that extreme, but Nike argued there was already a shoe of that thickness in existence,” said one leading sports brand executive. “That was not a shoe that anyone wore in elite competition, but Nike said it had been worn at college level in America, so that was the basis for the rules we now have.” Another shoe company executive said: “Brands are always going to innovate. Half the blame is laid at the feet of our international governing body who have not set the best guidelines for the last couple of years on shoe tech. “We knew back in 2016/17 that this was coming through so they could have set ground rules right from the start. It was only 2020 that this started getting put in place and it’s still a moving feast.” Having taken charge of athletics at a time when it was riddled with corruption and doping scandals, there remains a sense that Coe and his staff were simply unable to prioritise the shoe issue until it was too late. A World Athletics spokesperson said: “Perhaps we should have responded quicker by bringing the shoe companies together, as we did in late 2019, but we would have followed the same process and set the same principles we are working to now. “Our role as the regulator of our sport includes embracing innovation that helps athletes train and perform to their talented best whilst balancing that with fair play and reasonable access to new technology. “Against a backdrop of light touch regulation in the past it was always going to take time for a critical mass of the race results to work through to a point where World Athletics felt it was time to intervene in a more proactive manner.” On the 25mm limit, they added: “The maximum track shoe height was 25mm for a shoe that had been widely used for many years and was still being used across the athlete college system in the USA.” For those who have benefited from Nike’s spikes, it is galling to hear suggestions that the footwear is responsible for their achievements. Giles described such statements as an “insult”, while Scott said sceptics should get off their “high horse” after his huge 10,000m personal best. Others have been more forthcoming. Adidas-sponsored Jamie Webb, who also went under Coe’s old British record wearing ‘old technology’ spikes when finishing second behind Giles this month, said the evidence shows “we are entering a new era”. New Zealand’s double Olympic 1,500m medalist Nick Willis, who no longer has a footwear contract, last month revealed he ran a 1,200m time trial two seconds quicker than he expected when trying out New Balance’s carbon-fibre Fuelcell MDx spikes. “I’m a believer in the new spike tech,” he said. “Far different to anything I have run in for my 20 years racing the mile.” To date, only New Balance and Nike have provided athletes with ‘super spikes’ in competition over the past 12 months, with Joshua Cheptegei and Letesenbet Gidey smashing world records in the Nike ZoomX Dragonfly last summer. But any sense of inequality looks likely to be quashed by this summer, with Adidas, Brooks and Puma among shoe manufacturers due to bring out new ranges for the outdoor season featuring the carbon-fibre and super-responsive foam combination. While various numerical estimates have been thrown around, the question remains over exactly how much improvement the shoes provide, especially given the surprising identity of some of the athletes producing such remarkable times this winter: Giles has never made a global final, while two unheralded US college students catapulted themselves to seventh and eighth on the all-time indoor mile list. Asked if there was any sense of percentage improvements, Nike simply said: “We are pleased with the results we have seen to date.” Indeed, it is difficult to put a precise figure on it. So too with the often-compared move from cinder to all-weather tracks in the 1960s. Biomechanists believe that change provided around a 1.5 per cent advantage, but such was the effect of weather conditions on the cinder that there is no definitive number. Of the spikes, Hoogkamer explains: “For marathon running, we can deduce that if you run a marathon at a certain pace you can do trials in six different shoes in the lab setting. But running 800m race pace is hard enough once, so you can’t do the same trial comparisons. “The other thing is the marathon relies on aerobic capacity, which we can measure through oxygen uptake. For these middle-distances you get a huge amount of anaerobic contributions, which we still don’t know how to quantify. So measuring running economy at middle-distance race pace misses out all the anaerobic contributions. There’s no lab measure.” Orr concurs it is “harder to put your finger on” due to the difficulty in measuring, but says the New Balance spikes produce “some of the most consistent data we’ve seen”. All signs suggest what we have seen is just the start. Burns says the difference produced by this new shoe technology will likely prove more noticeable on the track than it has been on the road, forcing us to recalibrate how we perceive certain times. “For starters, you race a lot more so the data set is larger,” he said. “And the conditions are hyper-controlled. On the roads you have lots of external factors to deal with and people tend to race only twice a year. “In running we have associations with certain times - we have intrinsic connections to clocked performances. We’re basically seeing the distribution of those performances shift. “What that means is the performances we associate with being rare and exciting are going to be a little less rare. Very quickly we are going to come habituated to those times becoming a bit less special.” A second horse has bolted. World Athletics is currently looking into creating a formula that measures energy return, to potentially impose limitations through that route - rather than specific physical constraints - in the future. How to implement such regulations is tricky though, and such is the time-lag in shoe production that any radical rule changes would likely take years to put in place. The spikes are here to stay and will dominate middle- and long-distance races at the Tokyo Olympics, although with technological advances yet to be fully harnessed in sprint disciplines the likes of Usain Bolt’s 100m world record looks safe for now. Nike’s innovative Viperfly sprint spike unveiled last year is believed to have   but did not adhere to World Athletics regulations and has now been ditched having never been used in competition. A new legal version may yet appear before the Olympics, and New Balance - whose Fuelcell SDx spikes have helped Holland’s Femke Bol run the four fastest 400m times in Europe this year - also have designs on making a new short sprint spike legal by the Tokyo Games. Coe, who set 12 world records during his career, remains sanguine - publicly, at least - about complaints that the spikes make a mockery of comparisons with previous eras, insisting, “we shouldn’t be in the business of trying to suffocate innovation”. He said: “I don’t think we've reached that point where world records are being handed out like confetti. World records do matter. They need to be cherished. They need to be things that the world looks at and thinks, ‘That’s a new benchmark, and a suffusion of skill, talent, hard work and great coaching’. “There have been some technological advancements on what I was running in and what the generation before me was running in. If I slide down the ranking list, that’s the nature of sport.” One field of thought is that the new spikes will allow some suspect performances to be wiped from the record book with a preference for shoe-aided times over those potentially fuelled by performance-enhancing drugs. The implications could also be far wider than reducing elite times. Hoogkamer says the money that shoe companies input into training biomechanists will allow them to “help people with strokes to walk better, or find better prosthetics for people”.

44,Jimmy White: 'I gave Stephen Hendry a head start of 10g of cocaine and four bottles of whisky',"For Jimmy White, a renewal of rivalries with Stephen Hendry is enough to unleash a flood of memories - but few of them are happy ones.  Both men might now be in their fifties and well past their prime -   - but their reunion in the first round of qualifying for the Betfred World Championship in April promises to be one of snooker's red-letter occasions.  For White, however, the draw was bittersweet. In four World Championship finals between 1990 and 1994, White was beaten by Hendry: all left scars, although the deepest wounds were inflicted in 1992, when he lost despite being 14-8 ahead, and then 18-17 two years later.  While Hendry clocked up a record seven titles in total, White never did win a world final, although he was crowned the 'People's Champion', with public sympathy cranking up after each apparently impossible defeat.  White's free-spirited playing style was an endearing contrast to  , but the fact he was just as much a 'Whirlwind' in his private life ultimately proved decisive in denying him a title.  In his own autobiography White, now 58, claimed “I am lucky to be alive…I know drugs probably cost me 10 world titles”.  Speaking after the draw against Hendry, he said: “I have beaten Stephen in the World Championship a couple of times, but unfortunately they aren’t the ones everyone talks about.  “I lost the four finals to him…but in those [early 1990s] days I was giving him a head start of about 10 grams of cocaine and four bottles of Jack Daniels. “I came very close in winning two of the finals against him. In 1992 I was 14-8 up and getting my winning speech ready, but lost the next 10 frames.  “And then in 1994 I twitched a black in the decider at 17-17. But it is what it is, and I might not have been here if I had won the World Championship the way I was.”  White and Hendry's rivalry was always a friendly one - the Scot had practised with White, six years his senior, when he was just 13, and left an indelible impression even then. “I knew he was something special straight away and he became one of the greatest players the game has seen,” White added. “I played the majority of my best years against legends, two of the best ever in Steve Davis and Stephen. Steve was a bit more conservative at the table.   “And then there was this fantastic potter Stephen that came along and I had to compete against both. We have had so many battles not only at the World Championship but throughout our careers. And to draw each other at this stage of our careers is very bizarre.”  Either player would need to win four matches to get back to the Crucible. Hendry’s last appearance was in 2012, while White has not got to Sheffield since 2006, but the Londoner’s head is still spinning that fate has taken a hand, and given him a chance of some revenge so late in his career.  “I didn’t even see the draw announced on TV this week, or see it in any email,”  he said. “I had just finished practising, turned my phone on and I saw that I had two missed calls from Stephen.  “That on its own wasn’t too strange because we had been practising together recently. But I started thinking he wouldn’t call me twice so quickly like that to arrange a session.  “So I started to suspect what might have happened. I called him back, he said ‘Can you believe that’, and then I knew.  “It is absolutely bizarre, something from the snooker gods for sure. It is one that a lot of people might enjoy and look forward to.  “My closing line to him was that we wouldn’t be having a practice together before that match. But for me, I have found a bit of form and whoever I played, that is what I would be taking into it.  “I know that I will be playing him Tuesday week, and it is all about being ready for that. I haven’t stopped practising for about two or three years now. I'm much more disciplined than I used to be.” ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/snooker/2021/03/25/jimmy-white-give-stephen-hendry-head-start-10g-cocaine-four/
45,Aston Villa to offer Ezri Konsa and Tom Heaton new deals - what are the club's other summer priorities?,"Aston Villa are set to open contract talks with centre-back Ezri Konsa and England international goalkeeper Tom Heaton this month as Dean Smith moves to keep two key players from his squad at the club for the long term. Konsa has been one of Villa's most impressive and consistent performers this season, with head coach Smith backing him to eventually break into the England squad. A £12million signing from Brentford in July 2019, Konsa has established a fine defensive partnership with England international Tyrone Mings since the club returned from lockdown last year. Heaton is also to be offered an extension to his current contract, after recently returning to Villa's squad after a knee injury. Emiliano Martinez has since emerged as Villa's No 1 following his arrival from Arsenal last summer but Heaton is still valued as a crucial member of the squad. The 34-year-old was signed from Burnley for £8m and has under two years remaining on his current deal. Villa return to Premier League action on Sunday with a home game against Fulham, with captain Jack Grealish poised to return. Grealish has missed the last six league games with a shin injury but has completed a full week of training. Smith said: “It was mouth-watering to see what we’ve been missing a little bit, you sometimes forget how good he actually is until he comes back into training. “He’s been excellent, as you can imagine. He’s missed it, it’s been a frustrating one because there’s nothing visual you can see with the injury he’s had, it was just a shin injury, but we had to wait until he could persevere with the pain he was under.” Villa are set for another busy summer, with billionaire owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens determined to build on the club's upward trajectory. Their business will undoubtedly be defined by the future of Jack Grealish, who is emerging as a serious target for Manchester City. Grealish will become even more of a priority for Pep Guardiola if Erling Haaland moves to Real Madrid,  . The Villa captain will be 26 in September and has still not played in European football, while he will be left with a huge decision on his next move if he impresses at Euro 2021. Villa will clearly have a contingency plan in place if Grealish is sold, with Dean Smith working closely with sporting director Johan Lange. The move to tie down Konsa and Heaton is further sensible planning, and other players including Douglas Luiz, Matt Targett and Matty Cash are in line to be offered improved contracts. Villa are also keen to add at least one more winger, and another centre-forward to provide competition and backing for new England international Ollie Watkins. Lange is a highly regarded operator and will be keeping a close eye on bargain deals — after signing Morgan Sanson from Marseille in January, do not be surprised to see Villa exploit clubs in France again, due to the severe impact of Covid-19 on finances and the Ligue 1 TV deal.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/aston-villa-offer-ezri-konsa-tom-heaton-new-deals-clubs-summer/
46,Questor: vaccine makers’ shares suffer big declines – we discover why,"“Buy on weakness,” we suggested last month  , the vaccine maker. Well, there has been plenty of weakness: the shares stand 25pc below where they were when that column appeared. It is not the only vaccine maker to suffer a severe fall in its share price over the past few weeks.  , whose technology lies behind the Pfizer vaccine, has suffered a 20pc fall since mid-February and Moderna’s shares are 28pc lower over the same period. What is going on? Almost everyone on earth wants to get their hands on these companies’ products and  , so why does no one want their shares all of a sudden? In Questor’s view, the share price falls have nothing to do with vaccines or these companies and everything to do with shifts in the stock market – shifts, ironically, prompted by the success of those very vaccines. Investors are clearly lumping the vaccine makers in with technology stocks, or indeed growth stocks more generally, and have conceived an aversion to both on the basis that economic conditions will start to favour “value” stocks instead. The thinking goes like this. The vaccination programme will in time, despite the slowness of the rollout in many countries, lead to the end of lockdowns and therefore  . In such circumstances the businesses that experience the greatest improvement are those that suffered the most during the pandemic, such as those in the travel and leisure sectors. Investors therefore want to put their money into these stocks and they raise that money by selling their growth or tech holdings, which they see as having had their time in the sun. When economies are static or shrinking, investors are prepared to pay a higher price for the few companies able to grow – tech firms being the most obvious – but they are less inclined to pay up when far more humdrum, and more cheaply valued, businesses are growing as the rising tide floats all boats. A more technical matter accentuates the trend: investors sense the   and as a result no longer want to own conventional (non-index-linked) bonds. This pushes up their yields and this increases the “discount rate” that investors apply to investment returns they can expect into the future. The effect is to reduce the present value of those future returns and hence the value of the stocks that will produce them. Those already expensive growth stocks are the ones to feel the effects. In short, the falls in the vaccine makers’ shares say nothing at all about the quality of these businesses. They remain at the heart of countries’ efforts to extricate themselves from Covid’s grip and can expect to remain there in view of the growing realisation of the dangers posed by mutations of the virus. We may not relish the need for booster shots every few months but it will do no harm to the prospects of these businesses – and it is the makers of “mRNA-based” vaccines in particular that may be expected to bear much of the load as they are the ones, experts say, that are most easily and quickly adapted to counter new coronavirus strains. The pandemic has provided the validation that mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics needed and these firms have bright prospects well into the future. What then of our tips? As we said, we advised readers in the case of CureVac to buy on weakness and suggest that they do precisely that now. We are very happy to hold BioNTech. We had already taken (very large) profits on Moderna and see little need for readers to hold three firms in the same sector, although some may sense a bargain with the shares at their current price. The only vaccine maker we have tipped not to suffer a severe sell-off is Astra, no doubt because it had never benefited from its vaccine in the first place. Astra, famously and yet with little appreciation from some quarters,  . And the mud that is routinely thrown at it, justified or not, hardly helps the market’s perception of the firm. We   for its intelligent approach to researching new treatments, the opportunities presented by its presence in China and its highly capable boss. We did however say buy on weakness in Astra’s case too so readers should continue to watch the share price for such an opportunity.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-vaccine-makers-shares-suffer-big-declines-discover/
47,Questor: want to double your money in the stock market in a week? This is how to do it,"This column normally believes in long-term investing – let’s say over five years or more – so it’s a drastic change of course to seek to double our money in a week. Rest assured that we will go back to “get rich slow” next week, but today we aim to help readers win one of the new weekly prizes in our  , the latest round of which begins next Tuesday. In this third contest in the series we have increased the weekly prizes very significantly from £100 to £1,000 so there is now a strong incentive for readers to try their hand at this alternative, quick-fire approach to making money on shares. Questor must stress that we would only ever discuss such short-term speculation (it cannot be called investing) in the context of a competition such as this and not when your own real money is on the line. Perhaps the real benefit of this exercise will be as a demonstration, if any were needed, of the near impossibility of making large gains in short periods with any kind of reliability on the stock market. In the long term, a rational analysis of a company’s strengths will tend to win, but over short periods the benefits of such evidence-based approaches are swamped by the effects of sentiment. Investors, even professional ones, are human beings and their actions are affected by what is going on around them and by what others do, even if in the cold light of day nothing has changed at the company in question. So with all those caveats on the table let’s try to answer that question: if we want to double our money in a week in the stock market, what should we do? Step one: avoid the FTSE 100. On the whole the bigger you are the more stable you are and the less scope there is for a single event to move your share price materially. In fact, ideally we need to be exploring the lower reaches of the market: the FTSE Small Cap, Fledgling or Aim indices. Among some of the tiny companies here there really would be a chance of finding stocks that could double in a week. Unfortunately those options are not open to contestants because Fantasy Fund Manager is restricted to the FTSE 350, which is the combination of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, the next 250 largest companies by market value after the blue-chip index. So for the purposes of the competition we should seek our big winners at the smaller end of the FTSE 250. Now let’s think about which sectors are most likely to be home to companies with the potential for game-changing announcements that could send their shares soaring. The ones that spring to mind are miners, oil explorers and drugs companies. Here a lot can hinge on the success or otherwise of a single project: a mine, an oil well or a treatment for a disease. A big discovery of easily recovered gold or oil, or the success of the trials of a new drug, can transform a company’s prospects and its share price. Among smaller stocks it is not uncommon to see a share price double as soon as a positive announcement is published. The opposite frequently happens too of course, which makes such stocks dangerous when you invest real money. In our contest, however, you have the chance to win a decent sum if good news is heard and no risk of losing anything if the tidings are bad. Here are a few of the names in these sectors to be found at the smaller end of the FTSE 250. Diversified Gas & Oil and Energean are two oil explorers, Petropavlovsk, Hochschild Mining and Centamin are miners and PureTech Health, Oxford Biomedica and Indivior are healthcare companies. A look at their share price graphs shows that all have been volatile over the past year or so and volatility in this instance is of course precisely what we seek, protected as we are from real financial consequences from share price falls but in a position to benefit from rises. 
 
Questor suggests that readers follow some of these stocks. One approach would be to buy the shares of any that are closer to the bottom than the top of their recent trading ranges in the hope that any renewed volatility goes in our favour. Good luck – and remember to invest any winnings in stocks tipped (for real) here!",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-want-double-money-stock-market-week-do/
48,,"There could be a lonely hearts club of discarded England players forming at Liverpool’s training ground this summer. If  was surprising, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s predicament is summed up by the fact no-one is championing his prospects of an unlikely late bid to make this summer’s Euros. Not so long ago the attacking midfielder was not a candidate; he was a shoo-in. “I don't think I'd be telling secrets to say that we expected him to come to the World Cup with us (in 2018) and, at that stage, he was likely to be starting in the team,” England coach Gareth Southgate said last season. With respect to lingering international ambitions, Oxlade-Chamberlain prepares to face former club Arsenal this weekend knowing reestablishing a role at Liverpool is his immediate priority. Not for the first time, injury has been Oxlade-Chamberlain’s spoiler.  When studying Oxlade-Chamberlain’s Liverpool career and his current status, it is hard to shake off an obvious comparison with Danny Ings. That can be a source of encouragement in terms of reigniting the attacking midfielder’s career for club and country, and trepidation as he endeavours to make sure he shines again while at Liverpool. Ings enjoyed a promising start at Anfield, initially under Brendan Rodgers, and seemed the ideal fit for Jurgen Klopp before suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the same week the German coach was appointed in 2015. The striker recovered and then suffered further injury problems. To return to his earlier level demanded game time in his favoured position. He needed successive starts and a chance to build rhythm, momentum and form so as to demonstrate first choice credentials. Upon realising that was not going to happen at Liverpool, Ings had to decide whether he was content with occasional cameos as back-up to Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino. He wasn’t. After moving on, Ings’ successful spell at Southampton earned him an England recall and he has been recently making noises about being ready to return to a top-four club (or at least one annually competing to be one). Like Ings, Oxlade-Chamberlain was fully initiated and then impeded by serious injury. For the past two years, he has been fighting against the discourse that the cruciate knee operation he underwent in the 2018 Champions League semi-final against Roma will define his time on Merseyside. The fight to change the conversation is ongoing. Since 2018, Oxlade-Chamberlain has only once completed 90 minutes in the Premier League. And although he made 25 league starts in Liverpool’s title-winning campaign last year — contributing five goals and eight assists — he admitted this was the start of the process of finding that pre-injury form, not a sign he was back to his best. “I wanted more from myself for a lot of last season,” Oxlade-Chamberlain told  “I can look back on it and say, ‘eight goals (in all competitions) — my most ever in a season — and fourth highest in the team’. But to be honest I was not happy with how I performed for the majority of it.” Part of the problem in the last two years is that Oxlade-Chamberlain has been unable to secure a clearly defined role. In April 2018, he was developing into a smart, dynamic number 8, one of Klopp’s central three. Since his year out he has been of no fixed abode, often in the front three, occasionally deeper. Against Wolverhampton Wanderers during Liverpool’s last Premier League victory, he delivered an encouragingly sharp eight-minute cameo as a number 9. Klopp’s reaction was purposefully enthusiastic.  “Ox came on and was a real breath of fresh air. He was brilliant, especially in that position,” said the manager. Klopp’s admiration for the player and the man means there is no shortage of support and patience. There was no greater proof of it than when extending Oxlade-Chamberlain’s contract until 2023 when he had played only 19 minutes in the previous 12 months. The number of starts the Oxlade-Chamberlain made last season further underlined how eager Klopp is to accommodate him. Ask Klopp about the prospects of the man he always refers to as ‘Ox’ and there is no appetite to indulge any implication time is against the 27-year-old.  “Being in the best moment of your career and being compared with that after coming back from an injury, that’s a really dumb thing to do. ‘Oh, he’s not that good anymore…’ — I have no time for that,” said Klopp recently. It has always seemed like Klopp will work overtime to restore the level of the player he saw all too briefly before misfortune intervened.  But injury was again the disruptor at the start of this season, keeping the midfielder out until Christmas. He has made only two starts in his 12 Premier League appearances. Given Liverpool’s troubles, it is even tougher for the coach to grant a player returning from long-term injury a streak of ten successive games to get up to speed, even when established middle-men such as Fabinho and Jordan Henderson have been in defence or absent. The arrival of Thiago Alcantara, emergence of Curtis Jones, and enduring belief of Liverpool’s coaching staff that Naby Keita will one day put his injury toils to one side and deliver means the competition will not diminish, even if Gini Wijnaldum’s imminent departure creates a vacancy. For the last two summers, the next pre-season has been billed as critical to Oxlade-Chamberlain’s long-term aspirations of being a fixture in Klopp’s first-choice starting XI. The same must be said of 2021.  Maybe then he can swerve forgotten man status and rejoin the England conversation in time for the 2022 World Cup.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/next-foralex-oxlade-chamberlain-liverpool-midfielder-risk/
49,Custom House hotel makeover to reignite deal controversy,"One of the Government’s most famous buildings is to be turned into a plush London hotel in a £180m project – without a penny of any profit going to the taxpayer. Custom House – a Grade I listed Georgian building that dominates the north bank of the Thames in central London – is set to be converted by Guernsey-based  , which bought the freeholds and historic leaseholds of 132 HMRC offices for £370m in 2001 in a 20-year private finance initiative deal. The development is likely to reignite controversy over the original deal, signed when Tony Blair was prime minister. There was fury when it emerged the property portfolio had been transferred to Bermuda. A sale and leaseback agreement under which Mapeley provided serviced government offices means HMRC has since paid the firm more than £3.5bn. Mapeley is also facing questions about the details of its proposal for Custom House, for which the firm agreed a 175-year lease at a peppercorn rent. The application, which is due to come before a City of London Corporation committee later this year, sets out plans to convert the neo-classical building into a 204-bedroom hotel with two rooftop pavilions. The historic 180ft Long Room where officials once processed paperwork for customs duties will be refurbished. Conservation charity the Georgian Group opposes the plans and said they would harm the significance of the building. Mapeley subsidiary Cannon Capital Developments has devised other ambitious property developments in former government offices across the country, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leicester, Milton Keynes and Swansea. Mapeley’s other historic gems include The Mount, a Grade II listed property in Shrewsbury which is the birthplace of Charles Darwin, and Custom House in Belfast which was sold to an investment firm last year.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/custom-house-hotel-makeover-reignite-deal-controversy/
50,Green Homes grant axed after six months following poor take-up,"Rishi Sunak’s £2bn   is to shut after just six months following low take-up by the public. The insulation subsidy programme   is closing on Wednesday amid a failure to win widespread support. It was previously touted as a key part of government efforts to “build back greener” and meet the country’s climate goals, but was dogged by delays as would-be applicants struggled to get quotes for work from busy builders. Last week, a report by MPs accused ministers of underestimating the cost of improving the efficiency of many homes and asked for the scheme to be extended to accommodate the delays. The environmental audit select committee said the scheme was essential for improving Britain’s energy efficiency plans, but warned that delays in grant payments “had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled”. Before the decision to close the scheme was made, it was due to run until March 2022. The programme allowed English homeowners to apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their properties more efficient, cutting emissions and promising a saving on bills of up to £600 a year. The money could cover up to two thirds of the cost of improvements such as loft or cavity wall insulation and draught proofing. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said an extra £300m will be made available for investing in energy-saving measures for homes instead, distributed by local authorities. A spokesman for the Business Department said: “Applications made before the end of March deadline will be honoured and any vouchers already issued may be extended upon request.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/green-homes-grant-axed-six-months-following-poor-take-up/
51,Revealed: devastating social impact of Beeching railway cuts,"Half of England’s most deprived areas lost their railway stations in the Beeching cuts, a new report has found. Research by the passenger group Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) found that 88 of 175 stations in the poorest areas of the country have closed since 1960, with 23 areas losing two or more. The findings come as the Government has launched a £500 million project to overseen by the former head of British Railways, Dr Richard Beeching, which led to the closure of more than 2,000 stations.  The report, which studied transport links in 225 deprived areas, warned that the closures had had a particularly devastating impact on coastal and formerly industrial communities, which also suffered from poor bus links and low car ownership. One of the worst affected communities was the Town and Pier area of Dover, which has lost five stations within its boundary over the past five decades. The report, which was produced for the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for left behind neighbourhoods, said the findings highlighted the  to poorer communities that had become isolated. The Government is currently inviting towns and villages that lost stations in Beeching to apply for grants to build business cases As part of the programme, earlier this year ministers awarded £34 million to begin work re-establishing a passenger line between Newcastle and the mining town of Ashington. Meanwhile, the report by CBT found that the areas with the poorest overall transport links were predominantly on the coast or the outskirts of towns and cities in the North and the Midlands. The study found that 40 percent of households in those areas had no car, compared with just 26 percent across England as a whole. Local authority-supported bus services in those areas had also declined by 35 percent in the past six years. The report found that people living in areas with poor transport links faced greater difficulties accessing jobs, education, healthcare and other essential services. Silviya Barrett, head of policy, research and projects at CBT, said: “The Government must invest in public transport to ensure that no communities are left behind and that we build back better in a way that is fair and sustainable.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/revealed-devastating-social-impact-beeching-railway-cuts/
52,,"In the week when the UK Government grudgingly awarded a minuscule grant into   research, Stellantis, the giant European and American car-making group, has revealed a full production hydrogen fuel-cell van which will go on sale in Europe and the UK this year. Stellantis, the Peugeot/Citroen/Opel/Fiat conglomerate, also says that it is investigating using a similar hybridised fuel-cell system in a passenger car, which it will put into production in the near future.  “This is the moment,” says Carla Gohin, Stellantis’s senior vice-president of research and innovation. “We are not talking prototypes, these will be real vehicles for real customers and will be answering specific needs of commercial operators. “We are currently looking at ramping up the project,” she continued, “and it makes sense to look at fitting the next generation [of the technology] into passenger cars, which will be the next step.” The move coincided with an announcement from the French and German transport ministers committing their governments to hydrogen technology and earmarking €7 billion and €5.6 billion respectively into supporting the Stellantis project, improving public demand for fuel cells, developing green hydrogen generation and the provision of a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in both countries.  France currently has 25 hydrogen filling stations, Germany 90 and the UK 12. This will be an embarrassment for the UK Government, which has claimed that hydrogen is only suitable for marine, heavy commercial and rail technology and seems dead set on  .  Last year’s Department for Transport’s Decarbonising Road Transport consultation paper didn’t even mention hydrogen fuel cells, and   despite the Government’s national infrastructure board saying that the UK needed to plan for hydrogen. The new mid-sized fuel cell van, which will at first be badged as a Peugeot Expert, Citroën Dispatch and Opel Vivaro, will only be available as a left-hand drive vehicle this year, but by 2022 it will also come to the UK as a right-hand-drive Vauxhall Vivaro. Using a heavily hybridised fuel-cell drivetrain, the newcomer will be based on the group’s existing battery vans. The 45kW fuel-cell system sits under the bonnet, a 10.5kWh lithium-ion battery lives across the vehicle under the seats and three tanks holding 4.4 litres of liquid hydrogen at 700 bar are under the load floor. The project is a Franco-German one, which capitalises on the fuel-cell expertise at Opel built up when General Motors owned the company. Its fuel cell unit at Russelheim was handed over to PSA (when it purchased the company in 2017) largely intact; Opel has not made any secret of the fact that the unit’s experienced engineering team was still working on new fuel-cell projects. The new hydrogen van’s range is quoted at 250 miles with a refuelling time of only three minutes. There is no price yet, but Xavier Peugeot, Stellantis’s light commercial senior vice-president, says that it should have a total cost of ownership similar to that of rival conventional vans. He says that although the company has been at the forefront of light commercial electrification, it has identified “a serious percentage of users with operations which are not suitable for electric vehicles”. This is because such users operate a mixed-use cycle, straddling urban and out-of-town use and require a greater range, faster recharging and the retention of the vehicle’s cubic capacity load space.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/comment/france-germany-wrongfoot-uk-hydrogen-fuelled-road-transport/
53,Frustrated Donny van de Beek in no mood to give up on Manchester United,"Around 20 minutes of Holland’s World Cup qualifying match against Latvia had elapsed last Saturday when the chant started. A crowd of 5,000 had been assembled at the Johan Cruyff ArenA in Amsterdam as part of a test event ahead of the potential return of supporters and there was one face the Holland fans present were evidently eager to see. Donny van de Beek has become accustomed to a seat on the substitutes’ bench this season and, despite a 4-2 defeat to Turkey three days earlier, Frank De Boer, the Holland coach, was still unable to find a place in his starting line-up for the Manchester United midfielder. Yet Van de Beek’s first season struggles at United seem to have done little to damage his standing in his homeland and, with the Latvia game goalless, his name was soon being sung lustily by the locals at the stadium he had called home until his £40million move from Ajax last summer. The international break may have ended with a minor flourish for Van de Beek when he was introduced as a 77th-minute substitute against Gibraltar on Tuesday and scored Holland’s penultimate goal in a 7-0 rout but his failure to start any of his country’s three qualifiers was in keeping with the story of a frustrating season. There have been just two starts in the Premier League in seven months for United for Van de Beek and there is little expectation of that becoming three when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side resume their push for Champions League qualification against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday night. It is a deeply unsatisfactory situation Van de Beek finds himself in, and no one associated with the 23-year-old will attempt to disguise his unhappiness at his chronic lack of playing time, all the more so with the European Championships looming. But the idea that Van de Beek is looking for the first exit door out of Old Trafford underestimates his quiet determination to prove the doubters wrong, even if there have been no shortage of people lining up to suggest the Dutchman would be better off elsewhere and questioning whether he is the right fit for United’s style of play. Van de Beek was the subject of approaches in the January transfer window amid interest from clubs in Italy, Germany and Spain but, not only did United bat away the enquiries,   understands that the player had little interest in hearing what those suitors had to offer. For the moment, at least, that is understood to be the same stance he is adopting in relation to this summer’s window, too. Perhaps it will change if Paul Pogba was to sign a new contract with United. Van de Beek’s future could yet be influenced by what happens with Pogba’s own situation over the coming months. His signing was made partly in anticipation of Pogba leaving Old Trafford this summer so, if the Frenchman was to depart, it would remove a significant barrier to the first team. Yet what if Pogba stayed? Those close to Van de Beek suggest it might still take United to tap on his shoulder and suggest a move would be in his best interests for the midfielder to entertain leaving but, equally, there has been little to suggest the club would countenance a sale for now. If he was to go, a loan would be the most likely scenario as things stand but sources close to Van de Beek make the point that he agreed to join United in full knowledge that Pogba and Fernandes would prove difficult to dislodge, was aware the transition would not be easy and that he is not someone to run away from a challenge at the first sign of trouble. This, despite Van de Beek having still failed to force his way into Solskjaer’s thinking when Pogba was out injured for six weeks and expecting to have played more than he has. Van de Beek is not the first foreign player to need time to adjust to the pace and physicality of the Premier League and the demands of a new team. But, with Fernandes having a monopoly on the No 10 position, he is competing for one of two midfield positions and the absence of a world-class pivot and the complications that has created with the team’s balance invariably makes you wonder why United — regardless of the Pogba question — invested in Van de Beek over a quality holding midfielder. Solskjaer abandoned any plans to consistently field just one sitting midfielder when United were ransacked 6-1 by Spurs in early October and, despite operating at times as a No. 6 for Ajax, that was in the weaker Dutch league and the manager has yet to entrust Van de Beek in a deeper role alongside one of Fred, Scott McTominay or Nemanja Matic. Van de Beek has been accused of playing it too safe and drifting through games when he has played. Mark Hughes, the former United striker, urged him to be more “demonstrative”. Yet given the ease with which United turn over possession — less through risk-taking and more as a consequence of poor decision-making — it does at times make you wonder why the Dutchman is not used more given the greater care he takes of the ball. Like those Holland fans who chanted his name, United supporters are desperate for Van de Beek to come good. An interesting next few months await. ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/frustrated-donny-van-de-beek-no-mood-give-manchester-united/
54,The proposal threatening to condemn London's homes to darkness,"After a year of rolling lockdowns and shuttered offices, light and airy housing has never been more important to Britain’s legions of city dwellers. Alongside the old staples of a lively local high street, good pub and short commute, a new box has been added to typical home-hunter’s checklist – how much sun their property lets in. But the demand for natural light is threatening to put occupiers at odds with developers at a time when space is at a premium and   is seen as essential to solve the country’s housing crisis. In London, a consultation launched by mayor Sadiq Khan includes a possible reduction in a key measure of how much light builders must allow into their properties, the so-called vertical sky component. “There’s a bit of a battle going on,” says lighting consultant Paul Littlefair. “Obviously, you have developers who want to build bigger and bigger and have buildings that restrict more light. And obviously from a point of view of providing housing in London, you need all this extra housing. “But on the other hand, [you have] existing residents who need daylight and want to retain the daylight they currently have.” The vertical sky component calculates the angle of light entering through a window and is meant to prevent dingy houses from getting built. It is part of planning code and must be taken into account by developers along with other environmental measures. Campaigners argue the changes proposed in the consultation could condemn thousands of families to perpetual semi-darkness. They say that the changes will significantly cut how much light enters individual rooms and point out that being cut off from the sun can harm occupiers’ physical and mental health. “The links between daylight and both physical and mental health are very well established,” says planning activist George Turner. “After a year of being locked down in our homes, I think we can all appreciate the importance of having access to adequate daylight. “Daylight standards do not stop new development, they stop bad development. There is no reason why competent architects can’t design new buildings that protect the living conditions of neighbours.” The row over daylight is already causing a headache for ministers. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is poised to rule on a £500m project at 8 Albert Embankment, a London Fire Brigade site being developed into 443 homes which builder U+I says will create 1,200 new jobs. Researchers at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) have warned that 424 properties would fall below its recommended daylight standards as new buildings cut off the views from existing ones, including accommodation for disabled people in the ground floor of a nearby block of flats, and Turner is leading a bid to protect neighbours’ rights. A spokesman for U+I defended the development, saying the benefits outweighed the costs. He said: “As with all tall buildings in central London there will always be some impact, particularly in areas like this where local and regional planning policy supports high density development. “With a slender diamond shaped form, the taller elements of our proposals have been specifically designed to minimise any impact on neighbouring properties, and as a result the level of daylight retained would be considered normal in other central London areas. “This ultimately needs to be balanced against the huge number of public benefits that this scheme will deliver, including a modern new fire station [and] a permanent home for the London Fire Brigade Museum. More than 40pc of the properties being built will be affordable, the spokesman said. Despite the battle coming to a head over Albert Embankment, the debate is not a new one. The BRE has previously raised concerns about a host of other major projects including Wood Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, part of a rejuvenation of an area previously owned by British Waterways. Planning was approved in 2014 by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, despite BRE objections during the initial planning stage which found that 993 of 2,153 surrounding windows would fall below BRE thresholds for light levels if it went ahead. Other planned projects in the area had similar issues. Canary Wharf’s Heron Quay West caused 730 individual breaches of the BRE tests, while the proposed Columbus tower left 60pc of surrounding homes to fall below the minimum level for new buildings. Experts such as Littlefair admit there is increasingly a trade-off between protecting existing homes’ access to daylight and solving London’s housing crisis. As businesses across the capital embrace flexible working, that challenge is only going to grow.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/proposal-threatening-condemn-londons-homes-darkness/
55,Thomas Tuchel explains why he won't let Timo Werner work on his finishing,"Thomas Tuchel has issued a robust defence of Timo Werner and has told   to stop “overthinking” his difficulties in front of goal. Tuchel has gone so far as to prevent Werner from doing any extra work on his finishing in training, instead sending the 25-year-old away from the pitch because his ""body and brain"" already knows how to find the net. And the Chelsea head coach likened Werner’s problems to the challenge of trying to secure a dinner date, saying he will benefit from taking a “step back” from the issue. Werner missed an open goal from eight yards for Germany   in midweek, continuing a run of form in which he has scored just two goals since November. ""This guy has scored since he was five years old and he never stopped,"" said Tuchel of Werner, who signed for £47.5 million in the summer. ""He can trust that his brain and his body remembers to do that because it is absolutely usual for him to score. It will come back. It is just a matter of time. It is the moment not to think about it and not to read about it and not to even train extra. ""Yesterday I sent him in from training because he wanted to do some finishing with us. I just sent him in. I said: 'You don’t need that - your body, your brain knows how to score. It will come.' ""If a woman does not want to go out with you to dinner, you cannot force her. You just step a little bit back and maybe she will call you."" Tuchel confirmed that Werner will start against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, with Chelsea looking to cement their place in the top four ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against Porto next week. ""The goals will come, but of course he needs to do something for it,"" said Tuchel. ""The best thing to do is to not think about it and work hard. Work hard against the ball, be reliable with the ball, do your runs, don’t hesitate and be fearless. Don’t overthink it.  ""It is very easy for me to say because we aren’t out there and everybody is pointing fingers at him, but this is the challenge right now. This is how I see it. He will start tomorrow."" Chelsea will be without midfielder N’Golo Kante, who is suffering with a muscle injury. Kante is also a doubt for the first leg of their tie against Porto, which takes place on Wednesday. ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/thomas-tuchel-explains-wont-let-timo-werner-work-finishing/
56,Telegraph Team of the Season - who makes the grade in our XI of the year so far?,"Manchester City dominate   team of the season although – with seven players overall –  it is interesting that Phil Foden is the only one of their forward players to make it. But then the champions-elect often play without a central striker and the foundation of their success during this campaign has been their defence and midfield. he team of the season is set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation but is extremely attacking. The only defensively minded players close to making it in midfield were West Ham’s Declan Rice and Leicester City’s Youri Tielemans – although they finished a long way behind those selected. So, only   breaks into an otherwise all-City defensive unit, including goalkeeper Ederson, with City’s Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan in central midfield. The three behind the main striker are Foden,   and Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish who have all been outstanding. Foden actually finished second in the voting as a forward, just ahead of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Unsurprisingly  , though. The player who gained the most votes overall? It was Ruben Dias, ahead of Kane, in perhaps an early indicator as to who might win the ‘footballer of the year’ awards. Never mind the Premier League’s best, the 27-year-old was not even the best Brazilian goalkeeper in the division last season. But he has   while international team-mate Alisson has suffered. Ederson remains the most accomplished goalkeeper with the ball at his feet and has benefited from being far more uncomplicated in his approach which has helped his positioning.    The defender  . He is now an all-action play-maker who steps into midfield, or even out onto the wing, and is given licence to create from the right or left flank. City’s defence funnels into a back-three as he ventures forward. It has been thrilling from the Portugal international. It helps he has extraordinary stamina.  It has been   and - notwithstanding the mistake that cost England a goal against Poland - he has cut out the lapses in concentration that undermined him. Stones looks stronger, more aggressive and has grown in confidence and is becoming the outstanding ball-playing centre-half he had the potential to be.  In his first season in the Premier League  . Since arriving from Benfica Dias has transformed the City back-line and is, first and foremost, a defender who loves to defend. Dias is also a leader, a communicator and is strong in possession while reading the game well. A strong candidate for player of the year.  Although Shaw was voted United’s player of the season a couple of years ago that was more a reflection of how poor the team was. It has been a long way back for the left-back after his horrific leg break, a crisis of confidence and criticism from Jose Mourinho. Now he is   while showing he can also play in a back-three.  There have been games this season when arguably the world’s best midfielder has looked human. There have been others  . Even despite City’s dominance they are a better team with the Belgian who has shown his adaptability – and football intelligence – by occasionally playing as a ‘false nine’. He appears to be Pep Guardiola’s eyes and ears on the pitch.  The German international has flourished as a ‘midfield striker’. His goal contribution has been vital to City’s relentless march towards the title and it is a long way from when he was regarded as a more conventional No 8 or even a holding midfielder. His   as he has adapted to his new role.  The 20-year-old has made more than 100 appearances for City and has been shrewdly managed by Pep Guardiola. For such a young player   speaks volumes. Foden is an effortless footballer who can lay claim to being England’s ‘generational’ talent. It will be interesting to see whether he continues in one of the forward areas or drops deeper into a David Silva-like play-making role.  The transformative effect Fernandes has had on Manchester United is obvious.   with his goals and assists and how he sets the tempo of the way they attack. The midfielder is brave in possession and willing to try the unexpected and also demands extremely high standards from his team-mates. He has a fierce desire to win.  Since lockdown the Villa captain has taken his game to a new level. He needed to add goals and assists to his overall play and did that by firstly steering the club clear of relegation and then kicking on this season. Villa are . He is creative, clever and always wants the ball and always wants to be involved. Grealish is also able to impose his personality on games.  The Tottenham striker just gets better and better.   and adapt his game and is not just the best centre-forward in the Premier League but is also one of the best passers. His assist record is impressive as is his goals tally and Kane never shirks responsibility as he leads by example.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/telegraph-team-season-makes-grade-xi-year-far/
57,Marathon runner to appeal Olympics snub - after being overlooked for athlete a minute slower,"Charlotte Purdue, the fourth-fastest British marathon runner in history, will formally appeal her controversial omission from the first wave of track and field athletes named for the Tokyo Olympics after selectors instead chose an athlete more than one minute slower. Team GB announced its first seven athletes for the Games on Thursday: three men and three women in the marathon, along with Commonwealth silver medallist Tom Bosworth in the 20-kilometre race walk. However, the announcement was most notable for Purdue’s omission, who was the sole British entrant in the women’s marathon at the 2019 World Championships. Earlier that year, she was the first British finisher at the London Marathon in a personal best two hours, 25 minutes and 38 seconds. Instead, the final spot on the women’s Olympic marathon team went to Steph Twell, whose best time of 2.26:40 came at the Frankfurt Marathon in October 2019. Selection was always likely to prove contentious after only Steph Davis assured her place  . That left the selectors two further spots to fill, with Jess Piasecki, Purdue and Twell - all of whom missed the trials - eligible having previously run the required qualification time. Piasecki, the fastest of the trio with a 2.25:28 personal best, received her anticipated spot, but the decision to choose Twell over Purdue was far less expected. Although she had a medical exemption to miss the trials, Purdue expects to be fully fit come Tokyo and told   she will go through the official appeals process in a bid to overturn her omission. With the selectors not having to explain their decision publicly, it leaves guesswork as the only option to decipher their thinking. While Purdue has not raced since narrowly missing her half-marathon personal best in February 2020, Twell has completed two races in that time, most recently in a 5,000m on the track in the United States in February, perhaps allowing the selectors to be more assured of her form and fitness. Twell also has proven experience of competing at two previous Olympics - over 1,500m in 2008 and 5,000m in 2016 - while Tokyo would be Purdue’s debut Games. The three athletes for the men’s marathon had already been determined with 39-year-old Chris Thompson and Ben Connor confirming their places when finishing first and second at last week’s trials. Callum Hawkins was pre-selected last year. Meanwhile, the segment of the Olympic torch relay due to pass through Osaka in two weeks’ time has been cancelled due to a rise in Covid cases in the city. It had 616 new cases on Thursday, exceeding 600 for the first time since mid-January.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2021/04/01/marathon-runner-appeal-olympics-snub-overlooked-athlete-minute/

59,"Carl Frampton vs Jamel Herring: what is on the line, how to watch - and what is our prediction?","Carl Frampton bids to become the first Irish fighter to win world titles in three weight divisions when he takes on WBO super-featherweight champion Jamel Herring in Dubai on Saturday. But while it could be an historic night for Frampton, it could also be his last - the Northern Irishman has said he ""will retire"" if he fails to defeat Herring, who is known as the 'Fighting Marine' after completing two tours of duty in Iraq with the US Marines. The fight takes place in Dubai on Saturday, April 3 - with the main event at some point after 10pm. The bout was originally scheduled for Feb 27 but had to be rescheduled after Frampton sustained a hand injury.  Frampton, who will have hundreds of supporters' messages printed on his shorts on fight night, said: ""For me to win this fight, I will need to be perfect. If I carry out my game-plan, I believe I will win this fight. ""I'm very proud of what I have done in my career so far. But the chance to go down as the only ever three-weight world champion in the whole island of Ireland, and only the fourth in Britain, will put me in an elite bunch of fighters across the world, and it would make me very proud to do it."" Frampton's trainer Jamie Moore, who has worked with the likes of Tyson Fury, Amir Khan and Martin Murray, said: ""Ever since this match-up was made, I liked it for Carl. I think he has all the attributes and style to make history. He is right up there with the most talented fighters I have ever worked with."" WBO champion Herring views Frampton as his toughest test - but he has a five-inch height and reach advantage. He said: ""Of course you always want to use your physical attributes in any fight. But I will always give Carl respect. He probably beats me in the experience department. He’s been in those big fights. 2016 was a big year for him. Scott Quigg, Leo Santa Cruz, but it’s been a while since those days. And he was at the lower weight classes as well. ""My mindset as a fighter is to prepare for the best possible Carl Frampton. I know the photos and videos are out there, but I have to train as if Carl is actually the world champion. He’s a two-division world champion and I give him that honour and respect. But I just feel like for me, overall, I’m in the best shape of my life. This is a huge fight for my legacy. ""It’s his last opportunity and he wants to make history. Of course you’ve got to expect the best performance he could possibly put up. But at the same time I have a lot of goals and dreams that I still want to accomplish. We’ll have to see what it comes down to but I’m definitely prepared for whatever he throws at me."" The fight will be shown free-to-air on Channel 5, with coverage starting at 10pm. Frampton has certainly operated overall in his career against a higher class of opponent than Herring has in his - witness Leo Santa Cruz, Scott Quigg, Nonito Donaire, Kiko Martinez, to name some of the top boxers he has beaten - but at age 34, and in a heavier weight bracket than ever before, Frampton must be on point in this fight. Timing his punches and moving in and out cleverly will be the key. Frampton will have to employ deft footwork to get on the inside to let his punches go against the southpaw, who works brilliantly behind his jab. If Frampton can establish a rhythm early in the fight, and draw the American into a dog fight, he can make it his night. It is a tough call, but  will put it all on the line, and   if he is at his very best.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2021/04/02/carl-frampton-vs-jamel-herring-line-watch-prediction/
60,Marlie Packer interview: 'I want my son to see his mum win a World Cup',"Zoom call interruptions have become a wearying part of daily life in the pandemic, but they are not always unwelcome. Towards the end of a chat with Marlie Packer about motherhood, rugby and everything in between when she breaks off to fetch six-month-old Oliver.  Everyone knows Packer as the ferociously competitive forward who has driven England's Red Roses to two World Cup finals, winning one, but this is an insight into Marlie the mum – a softer, more reflective character, with a new sense of perspective on her life and work.  The task of  is never less than onerous, and neither is there one right path to follow. In December, Katy Daley-Mclean – who was Packer's captain in the World Cup triumph of 2014 – shocked the sport by   to spend more time with her daughter and partner. Packer has made a different decision to continue to strive at the highest level. The 31-year-old explains that Daley-Mclean has been a “sounding board” but that they are in different places in their careers and with the ages of their children. If anything, Packer is more motivated than ever after her partner Natasha gave birth last September.  “I never would have said before that I would be more motivated to win a World Cup or Six Nations but I want to be a world champion again and for Oliver to remember that,” she tells  . “I want him to be here in 2022 to say he watched mummy becoming a world champion rather than me just telling him about 2014.  “It really drives me now to be the best I can. With every game I play now being streamed or on television, he watches with Natasha because they can’t come to the games.” There are increasing numbers of women's rugby players in same sex couples having children – as well as Packer and Daley-Mclean, England's Claire Purdy had a baby boy in 2016. But the subject of same sex parenthood is not broached as openly in rugby as it is in football, for instance.  Packer is frank on her experience as a gay parent and explains that part of the reason she is speaking out is that the absence of her father during her formative years has given her a different perspective on parenthood. “My dad was in and out of my life when I was young – then in 2014, six months out from the World Cup, he died,"" she says. “That was quite a difficult time for me but my dad was never a presence in my life every day. People say that their fathers are their idols but for me, my dad was like when you crave something you never have. I just craved him so much because I never had him. “I do worry about Oliver a bit for when he goes to school – that he has two mums in a gay relationship. But we live in a different generation. I think he has two parents who will love him endlessly and anything he wants within reason, he will get. He will be very loved. “With all respect, my mum did an amazing job as a single parent and my grandparents were fantastic helping, but Oliver will have two parents who will do anything for him. And that is all I think it should be about.” Packer reveals that she and Natasha had been initially anxious about breaking the news but that Oliver has been accepted with open arms from both families. “It is has been really nice how accepting people have been. We were both a little bit worried about telling certain people in our families but when we told them, they were all super happy that Natasha was pregnant and we were having a child,” she says. “I know my mum never thought she was going to be a grandma anytime soon. She has been absolutely over the moon.” Team-mates have also been delighted by the arrival of Oliver and Packer seems almost giddy as she describes all the gifts that have been showered on her – particularly a customised babygrow with No 7 from Poppy and Bryony Cleall. She is also honest in explaining that when she hangs up her boots, she would be keen to grow the family and possibly carry a baby in the future. She was inspired by the experience of Natasha giving birth and what she learnt in ante-natal classes, albeit virtual ones. “I learnt a lot, not just for how to support Natasha as her partner for birthing but when it is my turn to have a baby,” she says. “I would definitely like to carry a baby but I want to focus on rugby over the next few years. The World Cup is obviously massive. You only get to play international rugby for a very short amount of time and then I will have time after that.”  Packer's feelings are exacerbated by her World Cup experience of 2014, where the euphoria of winning was dulled by her father's death. Reflecting now, she actually found defeat in 2017’s final against New Zealand easier to handle despite the acclaim that came her way. “I think I dealt with losing better than I did with winning in 2014. Then, I was very depressed after my dad died –although not knowingly. I just focused everything on rugby. We won this World Cup, which was sensational, I got the freedom of Yeovil, and there was a big ball for me. But I was sad. “I was smiling, and it wasn’t a fake smile, but I was very sad on the inside because I didn’t deal with the stuff around my dad. So, 2017 it was what it was, someone wins the game and someone loses the game. “In 2014 I felt I should have been really happy but actually with the following weeks, I wasn’t very happy but I didn’t know that at the time. Whereas in 2017, I was very in touch with my emotions and I had also just met Natasha that year which probably helped in that sense. “Don’t get me wrong what happened in 2017 was gutting but it just wasn’t meant to be. I am one of those people who believes everything happens for a reason.” The Marlie Packer of 2021 seems like a very different person to the 25-year-old who lifted the World Cup and again that comes back to Oliver’s presence in her life. “I would have been worrying a lot about what the coaches thought or I would re-watch a game the moment I got home. Now, when I get home on a Saturday, I go through the door and I give Oliver a big cuddle.  “Being a mum has made me a lot more open-minded, it has made me realise there is a lot more to life than just rugby. Before Oliver, I didn’t think there was much more outside of rugby. I know now that when I put my boots away life is just beginning.”",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/04/02/marlie-packer-exclusive-want-son-see-mum-win-world-cup/
61,Remember Michelle Wie West? She's back,"A promising first day by the British and Irish contingent at the Ana Inspiration was overshadowed by the remarkable return of Michelle Wie West, the former girl wonder who has come back to competition following a two-year absence. Wie West famously tied for ninth at this event as a 13-year-old amateur and 18 years later, returning as a mother, the Hawaiian showed she still has the star appeal to light up the season’s first major.  Nothing about her re-emergence at last week’s Kia Classic suggested she would feature on the Mission Hills leaderboard.  She shot 81-74 and looked bereft at the scale of the challenge confronting her after maternity leave and an extremely close brush with retirement.  But at the course that did so much to establish her as a prodigy, Wie West rolled back the years to post a two-under 70 to stand in the top 20, four off the pace set by Thailand’s Patty Tavatanakit. “I am just happy to see my name on the first page of the leaderboard,” Wie West said. “That's really special to me. Been a long time since I've seen that. I have a lot of great memories, my first one being 18 years ago.” Wie West — who finished runner-up at the Ana in 2014, the same year as she won her only major to date, the US Women’s Open — revealed how near she came to putting away her clubs for good. In 2018, she underwent wrist surgery, married the Golden State Warriors director of basketball operations Jonnie West — son of NBA legend Jerry West — and figured that a career which was ridiculously hyped to emulate that of Tiger Woods, but inevitably fell some way short had petered to its finish.   “I thought I was done, especially when I found out I was pregnant,” she said. “I thought that cemented it. Then we found out Makenna would be a girl and that changed everything. I started thinking I wanted to show her in real-time that I play golf. It’s one thing to have her watch YouTube videos, and it’s another thing to have her watch you with her own eyes and see you work hard. It’s been a huge dream of mine.” Of course, it will take a few years yet for Makenna — born last June — to understand what her mother is doing, but Thursday’s heroics suggested Wie West retains the ability if the hunger is present. “It feels weird,” Wie West said about the memories of 2003. “You know, looking back, I was a kid. I still feel like a kid. Having a baby definitely puts a different perspective on everything. I'm more excited to go home and see her than I am about my round, to be honest.” Charley Hull, Georgia Hall and Bronte Law all shot 69, with fellow Englishwoman Mel Reid on one-under.

62,WSL relegation battle: Who will slip up at arguably the worst possible time in a women's team's history?,"With the bottom four teams separated by just four points, the battle to avoid claiming the single Women’s Super League relegation spot is perfectly poised ahead of the final run-in. Three of West Ham, Aston Villa, Bristol City and Birmingham City will have reason to celebrate on May 9 - the final day of the season - while one team will suffer the agony of going down to the Championship. Whoever endures relegation will be dropping out of the WSL at arguably the worst possible time in the franchise's history, missing out on a slice of the top flight's first ever multi-million pound TV broadcast deal and the potential for regular exposure on BBC One, BBC Two and Sky Sports Main Event. Each of the four teams in danger will have experienced different challenges throughout a tough campaign, but who is best equipped to escape the drop and who are the key players capable of dragging their side out of trouble? Currently bottom of the table, West Ham are in the gravest danger. Former head coach Matt Beard left by mutual consent in November and there has been no ‘new-manager bounce’ yet under the latest man in charge, Olli Harder. The New Zealander is yet to oversee a single league victory since his appointment on December 23, drawing two and losing five of his seven WSL games so far. But with a squad full of international talent and experience, West Ham have the ability to save themselves. Given great exposure after starring in a BBC Three behind-the-scenes documentary, the 2019 Women’s FA Cup finalists have ambitions of challenging for major honours and most commentators predicted they would be closer to mid-table than bottom of the pile this term. Strangely, despite the team’s predicament, key first-team players were allowed to leave the club in January, including skilful Switzerland winger Alisha Lehmann, who moved to Everton on loan, while Cho So-hyun was loaned to Tottenham. However, they did strengthen with the addition of experienced Iceland international Dagny Brynjarsdottir, whose industrious work in midfield contributed to an improved team display for large parts of last weekend’s defeat at Old Trafford. Harder’s team have up two games in hand on those around them, but time is running out to prevent those bubbles from bursting.  Reading (a) 3rd April, Aston Villa (h) 20th April, Everton (h) 25th April, Arsenal (a) date TBC, Aston Villa (a) 2nd May, Man City (h) 9th May  Kenza Dali 
Formerly of French giants Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain, for whom the France midfielder played in the 2015 Women’s Champions League final, Dali’s pace is a key weapon for Harder’s team, who will need her big-game nous for all six of their final games. Newcomers to the top tier after promotion last season, Aston Villa saw a busy summer of recruitment in an effort to establish themselves in the WSL under the guidance of their women’s sporting director - former England striker Eni Aluko. But the West Midlands club have struggled for goals, netting the fewest in the league so far with only 11 in 16 games, and have fired blanks in their past four matches. On January 25, the club took the unusual step of appointing a new ‘interim manager’ without sacking existing head coach Gemma Davies, who had led Villa to promotion. Davies remains on the coaching staff, but ex-Birmingham manager Marcus Bignot has taken over. Under Bignot, Villa have won one and lost five in the league, but their fixtures since his arrival have been tough, including two against leaders Chelsea. Their schedule looks very different from here on in, including four games in 12 days that will define the entire season. In many ways Villa are the kingmakers in the run-in, because they still have games to come against all three of the other relegation candidates, including two against West Ham. Those home and away six-pointers against the East London outfit in particular will go a long way to determining who stays up and who goes down.  Everton (a) 4th April, West Ham (a) 20th April, Bristol City (h) 24th April, Birmingham City (a) 28th April, West Ham (h) 2nd May, Arsenal (a) 9th May Mana Iwabuchi 
A World Cup winner with Japan in 2011 and finalist in 2015, Iwabuchi has global pedigree and her silky skills, great balance and deft first touch have wowed WSL supporters of all clubs since her January arrival. Her superb individual effort against Tottenham in February gave the team their most recent win, but more moments of magic may well be needed to help save Villa. It may be a cliche but this campaign has certainly been a ‘season of two halves’ for League Cup finalists Bristol City, who were winless in a tricky first half of the campaign which included manager Tanya Oxtoby suffering from Covid-19. From December onwards her side showed improvement, picking up a first away point at Reading and then beating Aston Villa in the cup quarter-finals, and then Beard, formerly of West Ham, arrived to provide maternity cover for Oxtoby for the remainder of the campaign and he has seemingly worked wonders. Bristol City have picked up nine points from eight games since Beard’s arrival, including three hard-fought away draws and a thrilling 3-2 home victory over Reading that lifted them off the bottom of the table. That has boosted confidence greatly, but their situation remains perilous and they have played more games than all of their nearest rivals. Beard said after last weekend’s 1-1 draw at Birmingham that he felt the West Country club needed “one more win” to be safe. The most likely source of that win could be their trip to 11th-placed Villa, while if the battle does go down to the final day of the campaign, Beard’s team will fancy their chances against Brighton, over whom they were emphatic 3-0 winners in January. Arsenal (h) 4th April, Aston Villa (a) 24th April, Man Utd (h) 2nd May, Brighton (s) 9th May  Ebony Salmon 
It is difficult to overstate the influence of England striker Salmon on Bristol City, not least because she has scored more than a third of their league goals. Her intelligent running in the channels and quick counters give the team an attacking threat against any opponent and Beard has tipped her to go “right to the very top”. Before the start of the season Birmingham’s hopes looked extremely slim, with manager Carla Ward having only eight senior players at her disposal when she arrived in August and only minimal resources available for further recruitment. They were many people’s clear favourites to go down. Nevertheless, in the early parts of the season, Ward’s team excelled and defied all the odds to win three of their opening seven games, as well as reaching an FA Cup semi-final. Come December, remarkably they were in the top half of the table and well on course for safety. Yet the club's thin squad has been so stretched at times during this campaign - they frequently could only name two substitutes - that for January’s meeting with Tottenham they were unable to field a side and subsequently a tribunal awarded the victory to Spurs. However, this month’s late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at West Ham, plus a from-behind draw with Bristol City, have put them closer to securing survival. As well as having the most points on the board, Birmingham’s run-in looks the most favourable because it includes three home games, with Reading, rivals Aston Villa and Tottenham all set to visit Solihull. However, home is where Birmingham have struggled this season - they are yet to win a home league game this term, picking up just two points from a possible 24 so far. Chelsea (a) 4th April, Reading (h) 25th April, Aston Villa (h) 28th April, Man City (a) 2nd May, Tottenham (h) 9th May Claudia Walker 
With five of Birmingham’s 13 league goals this season to her name, former Liverpool and Everton striker Walker has led the line for Birmingham and will be key to their survival hopes. Speaking in her latest pre-match press conference on Friday, Ward said she felt her team would need “probably another two” more points to be safe, adding: “If we’d beaten Bristol City we’d have been there or thereabouts. Our goal-difference should give us a point as well. It’s going to be a fascinating run-in. I heard Matt Beard allude that it will probably go down to the final day and I have to agree, I think it will.”",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/wslrelegation-battle-will-slip-arguably-worst-possible-time/
63,,"For the last 12 months, tennis has emitted a low grumbling sound, like a diesel engine idling at the lights. Listen closely, and you can hear dozens of fit young athletes grousing about the misery of the pandemic: the cancelled tournaments, the reduced prize money, and above all the quarantines. Should we have sympathy for their plight, or should we pull out our imaginary violins? Well, it’s true that tennis has suffered more than any other major sport, because it is uniquely global – far more so than golf, for instance – and thus dependent on international travel. But then the players go and remind us how out of touch, and how monumentally selfish, many of them actually are. The latest instance came this week in Miami, where the enterprising  reporter Ben Rothenberg asked half-a-dozen press-conference guinea pigs whether they were planning to be vaccinated. He encountered a wall of scepticism. Not everyone is against. World No 2 Naomi Osaka said “I’m planning on getting one … whenever I’m eligible.” But Andrey Rublev and Elina Svitolina both stressed that there was no advantage to them in having a jab, as it wouldn’t save them from future bio-bubbles and quarantines. Meanwhile Aryna Sabalenka spouted some mumbo-jumbo about damage to the genetic code. Finally, Diego Schwartzman said “It's not a tradition in my family to get any vaccine” before later backtracking and blaming his English for any misunderstanding. The first thing to say here is that athletes are uniquely paranoid about what they put in their bodies. Indeed, they are taught to be that way by the World Anti-Doping Agency. So at a time when Germany has   over blood clot fears, one can forgive them for feeling twitchy. But then you look at their answers again, and blood clots make no appearance. The first two negatives cited a lack of personal advantage. This misses the fact that – for the young and healthy – vaccinations are not supposed to be about you. They are about the vulnerable people you could unintentionally infect. You can see the personal logic here. For the likes of Rublev and Svitolina, stepping off the tour to get a jab will lead to lost training days and travel issues. From a pragmatic perspective, the experience of actually contracting the virus is likely to be so trivial that they would be better off picking it up on the road. What this position ignores is that infection makes them a danger to public health. And then there is Sabalenka, who said “There is the two [vaccines], and I want to make the one I think is more expensive and the one is not going to your genetic stuff.” This sounds like a half-baked theory found on the internet. It thus fits in with the pattern of   since he became tennis’s first vaccine sceptic just under a year ago. We could point to a different kind of contagion here; that of bogus, pseudo-scientific ideas. Tennis once again finds itself uniquely vulnerable, to misinformation this time. The players are headstrong young athletes who run their own mini-team of coaches, physios and fitness trainers. It’s hard for their support staff to guide them when they make all the money and call all the shots. Yes, you could say the same about golfers. But tennis players tend to leave school earlier, often before puberty, and thus complete very little formal education. Rothenberg’s questions prompted enough debate around the world for both tours to issue a statement. The Women’s Tennis Association said that they were not interested in interfering because “this is a personal decision we respect.” The men’s tour are talking to “consultants in infectious disease and virology”. Sooner or later, one expects that a big event – perhaps it could be next year’s Australian Open – will make vaccinations essential, and thus nudge the player base into complying for their own selfish reasons. For the moment, though, many members of the locker-room are coming across as narcissistic and blinkered. The one person who has judged the public mood from the beginning is Rafael Nadal. In Melbourne, for instance, he undercut the chorus of outrage at two-week lockdowns by saying “You see how many people are losing their father, their mums, without having the chance to say goodbye … When you see all of this, you have to stay a little bit more positive.” Nadal is a  , someone who sees family and community as the most important values. You might remember him helping to clean up his home island of Majorca after deadly floods swept the capital a couple of years ago. His peers have less life experience, for many have spent their entire lives in another sort of bubble: that provided by their agent, coach and trainer. Even so, they have had a year to consider the implications of the pandemic. And now they have switched from bemoaning their personal suffering to denigrating the only solution. There is something curiously childlike in this contradiction.  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/03/31/tennis-stars-vaccine-response-selfish-blinkered-damaging-sport/
64,England's Euros winners and losers from Gareth Southgate's new emphasis on attack,"Gareth Southgate has already started preparing some of his England players for the possibility of missing out on his squad for the European Championships and is planning more talks over the coming weeks. Rather than leaving his players in the dark over his plans, England manager Southgate is trying to prepare those likely to miss out for the worst and also give those on the fringes a clear idea of what they need to do between now and the end of the season. Southgate has also suggested that his Euros squad will be more attacking than the squad he took to the World Cup, which should be good news for Jack Grealish, who is due to return from injury for Aston Villa this weekend. Asked how hard it will be to leave players out of his Euros squad, Southgate said: “That, of course, is a difficult message, very difficult and nobody looks forward to it. But I’ve always got to remember that it’s worse for those receiving it than it is for those giving it, so you’ve got to have that empathy with how the players are feeling.  “I’ve spoken to quite a few already this week and I will do over the next couple of weeks, so that they know exactly where they sit because I think that’s helpful. You’ve got to manage expectations and have some reality about what they might need to do between now and the end of the season. But the reality is whenever you’re delivering that difficult news, it’s a horrible conversation to be having.” Here,   looks at the players who Southgate may have already spoken to or could be planning talks with and assesses where his big decisions lie. The defender did not play a single minute of England’s three World Cup qualifiers and has lost his place at Tottenham. The fact Southgate admitted he does not need any more than eight defenders in the squad is ominous for Dier, who must, at least, quickly win his Spurs place back and produce a series of impressive performances to give himself some hope.  One of the stars of England’s 2018 World Cup run, Trippier did not start any of the San Marino, Albania or Poland games and Kyle Walker’s ability to play as a right-back or on the right side of a back three, together with the emergence of Reece James, must put the Atletico Madrid player’s place in jeopardy. The  , the Liverpool right-back now faces an uphill task to get back in for the Euros. His only chance will be to try to out-perform James and Trippier over the remaining weeks of the season, as it is hard to see him displacing Walker. Two of the 10 players listed as defenders in England’s World Cup squad three years ago were Ashley Young and Fabian Delph, who could play in midfield, and explains why Southgate will not need more than eight defenders at the Euros, He said: “In Russia, we played Kyle Walker in a back three and we have some players who can play in more than one position. Luke Shaw has played in a back three for Manchester United, Chilwell has as well. It’s not essential to have more than eight and the more defenders we take the less we have in other areas of the pitch.” Southgate faces some big decisions in his midfield and attack, and it may be that his desire to make space for as many of his creative talents as possible will prompt a tough decision over his out-and-out strikers. “We’re a bit more fluid and adaptable now and we’d like to cover some different possibilities,” said Southgate. “We have some exciting wide players and players who can come in off the line and play as an attacking eight or 10. We do have different options in those creative areas and we’ve got to find a way of getting them into the squad.” So which players are likely to benefit from Southgate’s plan to find space for creative talents in his squad and who may be battling over one place?  The   missed the World Cup qualifiers through injury, but it may well be that the England manager has already given him some words of encouragement and a good end to the season should see him go to the Euros.  Both men could go to the Euros if Jordan Henderson cannot return to fitness in time, but if the Liverpool captain recovers then it may well be that there is only space for one of Phillips, who started against San Marino, Albania and Poland, and Ward-Prowse. The Arsenal teenager  , including left wing-back, and looks a very useful squad player for Southgate to have. But his inclusion would potentially mean going to the Euros with only seven dedicated defenders or dropping Jadon Sancho. Calvert-Lewin scored twice against San Marino, but he will know that Ings will also feature heavily in Southgate’s thinking if the Southampton star can remain fit for the rest of the season. It could end up being a straight end-of-season shoot-out between the two strikers. The midfielder has enjoyed a fine season for Leicester City, but, barring an injury crisis, it is hard to see how he can now force his way back into Southgate’s plans in time for the summer. It is looking increasingly like he can book his holidays.  may have suffered his Leicester City injury at just the wrong time and, while   and   are likely to know they will be relying on others dropping out to force their way into Southgate’s final squad, there is another Leicester man whose hopes look to have disappeared completely. Of course, injuries will dictate some of Southgate’s final decisions but nobody will want to see the England manager’s name flash up on their phones over the next couple of weeks.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/englands-euros-winners-losers-gareth-southgates-new-emphasis/
65,Lord's welcomes back fans - in the poshest way imaginable,"For the upper-class Londoner in the late 1800s and for much of the early 1900s, it was a sporting calendar highlight only matched by Henley Regatta and Royal Ascot. Now, in the 216th year of the annual match, the public school cricketers of Eton and Harrow are in keen demand again - as the first sporting spectacle with a crowd at Lord's. The match between schools that have produced Prime Ministers and England internationals alike has been confirmed as a Covid-19 safety testing event for the so-called home of cricket. Oxford and Cambridge will also have an audience for their varsity match the following day as organisers plan to have the venue 25 per cent full for England's Test match against New Zealand in June. Eton-Harrow once attracted crowds of 20,000 into Lord's, and was covered extensively by  . It is known as the only annual sporting fixture to trace its roots to before the Battle of Trafalgar. In a lengthy letter to MCC members explaining a ballot for the eagerly-awaited Test, chief executive and secretary Guy Lavender said the Eton-Harrow match on May 22 will play an important part in the historic venue receiving a safety certificate from Covid-19 inspectors. Ticket arrangements are yet to be confirmed for the school and varsity matches, but it is expected numbers will be initially below 5,000. ""A limited numbers of spectators will be permitted at each of these matches and we have earmarked both days as validation events to prove our Covid-safe operational capabilities to Westminster City Council, the body which grants the safety certificate for Lord's,"" Lavender wrote. The school match is scheduled immediately after the Government's May 17 relaxation of crowd rules, which will see larger venues welcome back 10,000 fans. ""We will advise further details for this weekend in due course, but our immediate focus is arrangements for the New Zealand Test,"" Lavender wrote, explaining the venue's famous Pavilion will be partially available. Eton, founded in 1440, and Harrow, 132 years later, first played each other on June 20, 1805. Among many notable former members of the Harrow XI was Lord Byron, while Alec Douglas-Home played for Eton in 1921 and 1922. Prominent cricketers include Nick Compton (Harrow) and Alex Loudon (Eton). Matches have been played at Lord's except for 1915-1918 and 1940-1945, when they were held alternately at the two schools. The 1970 match was also played at Harrow as Lord's was reserved for a Gillette Cup tie. Lord's became the first major sporting venue to declare it is planning for ""full ground capacity"" in December thanks to breakthroughs in the Covid-19 vaccine. However, as   disclosed last month, there will be no traditional early-bird queues, at least until the visit of New Zealand from June 2. Despite being told not to queue,  MCC members have been assured they will be the first spectators to return. Lord's has enjoyed the fastest sales in its history for England's post-lockdown ODI fixtures this summer. The MCC has fared better than many other sporting outfits due to the loyalty of its membership base, which has remained at full capacity since the first lockdown. However, the club has told its members in a letter that ""the budget suggests we could be around £10 milllion worse off than a normal year"". Based on the committee's ""prudent"" projections, a cash outflow is forecast at just under £12m, of which £7.4m is being spent on redevelopment projects.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/04/01/lords-welcomes-back-fans-poshest-way-imaginable/
66,Meet Faf de Klerk and Raffi Quirke: How Springbok master took English apprentice under his wing,"Judging by appearance alone, the untrained eye might struggle to differentiate between these two tank-topped scrum-halves, both under six feet tall, with guns blazing as they chat in the early-spring sun. But appearances can be deceptive: one is the master, the South African World Cup-winner, Faf de Klerk; the other is the apprentice, Raffi Quirke, the 19-year-old Englishman who only made his senior debut for the duo’s club, Sale, in February. Despite their assimilated veneers, the chasm in their careers could not be deeper. De Klerk, 29, is one of the sport’s pre-eminent No 9s and has played a significant role in Sale’s rise to the European knockout stages  . Quirke, as North West as Coronation Street, has played for both England under-16s, under-18s and is an under-20s squad member, but last weekend’s win at Wasps was his first senior start. The speed of Quirke’s rise from colt to senior has been rampaging, however, and the parallels with De Klerk, which go far beyond the rhyming names, have not gone unnoticed. Quirke might only be 19, but he is a scrum-half of overflowing rugby intelligence; reason enough, his Springbok mentor believes, to include him in the England scrum-half debate – and not at under-20s. ""He’s probably in the conversation,"" de Klerk tells   ""If he gets a full season of playing Premiership rugby and continues to go from stride to stride then I see no reason why he can’t (play for England). ""His kicking and passing game have come on tremendously in this last six months, and that’s something on which I would always rate a scrum-half. You can have a good running game, but if your basics aren’t good then you’re never going to excel at international level."" De Klerk has a decent handle not just on international No 9s, but on the English scrum-half landscape, too. A sixth of his caps have come against the Red Rose, with Ben Youngs the opposite number on every occasion, and from his Premiership exertions he has faced most, if not all, of the other contenders to a position seen as one of Eddie Jones’ most problematic. ""Looking at the nines, [Raffi’s] game is similar to Dan Robson’s, but he’s got the kicking and passing game of Youngs coming along very well,"" he adds. ""So, maybe another season or so, but he’s still got plenty of time, mate."" Although sitting alongside Quirke, it is de Klerk’s identification of his padawan’s improvement that defines his acclaim as genuine rather than politely hyperbolic. He was in a similar position to Quirke growing up, but his game was not as developed. ""I was a mess back then, just trying to learn as much as I could,"" De Klerk says. ""Raffi’s far ahead of where I was, so he’s one up. I was a lot like Raffi when I was younger, but I was a lot more erratic in my decision-making. So I tried to do as much as I could, knowing that you need to bring calmness and control to the role. ""One good thing at Sale is that all the nines have a close relationship and we try to learn off each other. Even when I watch Raffi’s games with him, I still learn about where I can improve. It’s great to have some proper competition with Cliffy (Will Cliff) and Gus Warr also here. While we push each other to get better, there’s no animosity. It’s a really good environment."" Quirke’s formative years were spent idolising World Cup winners from a different generation – Jonny Wilkinson and Jason Robinson – but he is not overawed by the approbation from one of rugby’s current diamonds. He is fiery enough to state that he ""definitely"" wants to play for England, but is mature enough to admit that ""it still feels quite far away"". For now, his focus is on ""smashing"" the under-20 Six Nations that is due to go ahead this summer and on establishing himself at Sale. For that, there is no better jedi master than De Klerk. ""We spend every day in training together; backs meetings, separate meetings,"" Quirke tells  . ""I always try to watch my games back with Faf and try to pick up as much as possible. It’s great – any question I have I can just go and ask him straightaway.” For all of Quirke’s ambition and precociousness, however, he is still a young head on young shoulders. And he is not too proud to confess that he struggled for shut-eye ahead of his first Sale start. ""All week I was very nervous, but when the whistle went it felt like another game,"" he adds. ""I just tried not to mess up. It has felt amazing. I was fourth, third choice at the start of the season and since then it’s been so quick. ""Alex (Sanderson) said he would give me an opportunity. He said I was on the edge of the rotational squad but if I played well and took my opportunity then I’d be involved – and that’s what I’ve managed to do."" The duo look set to spearhead Sale’s charge into the business end of the season, a challenge they will address through guts, punching above their respective weights and freedom of impulse. ""We both like to defend and make big hits,"" De Klerk says. ""If you’re a smaller guy who’s not doing that then maybe it’s not the right thing for you, if you can’t do what a bigger guy can do. ""And instinct is massive. If you take that away it becomes easy for the defence. We’re in a position where we can change games. It’s great to have that freedom, but you also need to learn that sometimes it’s not right to try something."" Instinct is an enormous driver for Quirke, too, described by de Klerk as ""one of the most instinctive players on the pitch"". ""I hadn’t played for such a long time and we had these internal games last year with England under-20s, between North and South,"" he says. ""I was worried that I might have lost that instinctive play because I hadn’t played for months. But luckily it was still there."" ""Luckily"" not just for Sale and England under-20s, but perhaps for Jones, too.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/04/02/meet-faf-de-klerk-raffi-quirke-springbok-master-took-english/
67,,"In the aftermath of   last month, Mikel Arteta described his team as having “two faces”. There is the good Arsenal, an energetic and organised unit capable of scoring three times against a team of West Ham’s resilience. And then there is the bad Arsenal, a sloppy and disinterested collection of individuals who can concede three goals in the space of 17 first-half minutes. This inconsistency has been their fundamental problem this season, and the primary reason why they are currently ninth in the Premier League. Arsenal are an unreliable team, full of erratic players, and no one embodies their “two faces” more than Alexandre Lacazette, the French striker whose form in England has regularly fluctuated between outstanding and underwhelming over the past four years. Arsenal are a streaky club and Lacazette is arguably their most streaky player. At his best, as he was against West Ham, he is a crucial cog in Arteta’s attack, bringing others into the game and providing plenty of goal threat of his own. At his worst he can be so poor as to be destructive to the wider cause, his shoulders slumping and his head dropping. That body language has been noticed by Arteta, and is something he and the club worked on earlier this season. It was the Boxing Day victory over Chelsea that triggered a transformation in Lacazette, who looked to be sliding out of contention in the first half of this season before, typically of his Arsenal career, re-emerging as one of their most important players in 2021. The numbers tell a story of their own: before Christmas, Lacazette had contributed three goals and zero assists in the Premier League. Since Christmas, he has scored eight goals and provided two assists, as well as a further assist in the FA Cup. He has three goals in each of his last three league starts against Liverpool,  , and looks set to be their main attacking threat against the champions. In some ways, though, Lacazette’s resurgence has presented Arsenal with a problem. His contract expires in the summer of 2022, meaning he will have just one year remaining when this season ends. At 29, there is not much appetite to offer him a lucrative and lengthy deal, especially when one considers the long-term contracts that have already been handed to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 31, and Willian, 32.  As of early December, there was little doubt that Arsenal would look to cash in on Lacazette come the summer, while they still could. But now, can they afford to let him go? No other player in the squad offers what he does in a central striking position, dropping deep and holding up the ball. If he leaves, he will need replacing.  The issue, Arteta said this week, will be dealt with at the end of the campaign. “We will address it in the summer, speak to him and just propose the future we want,” said Arteta. By then Lacazette will be 30 years old, and will no doubt be expecting his next deal to be the last big contract of his playing career. Roma, Sevilla and Atletico Madrid have all been linked. There are off-field issues to consider, too. Lacazette is a player of significant influence within the Arsenal dressing room (he is described by sources as a far more dominant character than Aubameyang, the captain) although not always in a positive way. He has not seen eye to eye with every team-mate over the years, but equally he has been crucial to the progress of some of the young stars in Arteta’s team. When Emile Smith Rowe was asked earlier this year which player had helped him the most, he named Lacazette. “He gives me so much confidence,” Smith Rowe said. “As we link up and play together, he talks to me a lot. I would probably say he has spoken to me the most off the pitch.” With Smith Rowe, the relationship has worked both ways. Lacazette’s uplift in December coincided with the introduction of Smith Rowe as a No 10, a tactical change that has continued since the arrival of Martin Odegaard.  Lacazette is a player who thrives in tight spaces, combining with his team-mates as he plays short passes and one-twos. The Frenchman’s game is built on sharpness, rather than pace, and he has looked at his best when he has movement around him. As an example, Arsenal’s finest team goal of the season, scored by Bukayo Saka at West Bromwich Albion, came from a quickfire move involving Lacazette and Smith Rowe on the edge of the box. It was the same in Lacazette’s second, and best, season in Arsenal colours. For much of the campaign he played in attack alongside his close friend Aubameyang, combining to devastating effect in their run to the Europa League final. He was voted Arsenal’s player of the season for the 2018/19 campaign. For a fee of £46.5 million, Arsenal would have expected to see these performances more consistently over the past 18 months. And therein lies the problem with Lacazette, who is probably too good to be allowed to leave without a serious investment in a replacement, but not good enough to be worthy of a lucrative new contract.  Arsenal’s search for a solution is set to be one of the most important issues of their summer, and a potentially defining moment for the player. If Lacazette is to stand any chance of earning that big-money deal, at Arsenal or elsewhere, he will need to keep showing the best of his “two faces” in the coming weeks.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/alexandre-lacazette-embodies-best-worst-arsenal-can-afford/
68,The 20 best players in the Premier League: Power rankings for February/March 2021,"The Premier League returns this weekend and to remind us all of what we've been missing out on, here's a ranking of the 20 players who performed best (according to data and what we've observed with human eyes). January's list is below in case you want to check who's moved up: Wolves' creative players were struggling to produce a huge amount of assists even before Raul Jimenez suffered that awful head injury but in recent weeks both Adama Traore and Neto have started to look like they've taken on the weight of responsibility to make things happen themselves. Neto in particular looks like a top level Premier League star already and created 14 chances in open play, with two of those turned into goals by teammates. He even scored one himself in an excellent solo performance against Southampton. Three goals and two assists in nine games for a player who keeps improving and may end up a big success story in his late 20s like Jamie Vardy. May have been in the England squad were it not for troublesome injury problems which his clubs will be extremely keen to have resolved before games resume on Saturday. Has looked close to his absolute best recently. Made 15 interceptions over eight appearances and was outstanding - as in absolutely magic - against Liverpool and Leeds.  Looks destined for a bigger club rather soon. Can dribble, shoot, assist and seems to always make the right decision when cutting in from the wing as an inside forward. Superb against Wolves and Southampton in particular, Raphinha scored three goals and provided one assist in nine games. Here he is compared to one of the galactic stars of the league: Raphinha's radar is what we'd expect to see from a Liverpool, Manchester City or Manchester United level of attacker.  Despite being a centre-back   of any player in the league, operating as something like a (very) deep-lying playmaker for Fulham and doing it rather well. His long balls into space have been key to their upturn in form and quick attacking play. There was shock around the football world as Gareth Bale revealed his contractually obliged plans to return to Real Madrid at the end of the season and if he does go back, he returns as a player reminiscent of the Bale we'd all grown so familiar with. Sometimes he looks like a top tier, elite level forward, especially against the likes of Burnley and Crystal Palace, but then he does absolutely nothing in difficult matches like the defeat to Arsenal. Isn't a great tactical fit with what Jose Mourinho wants to do but can decide matches on his own if the team is built around him.  The unsung hero of the Southampton defence. Nobody made more interceptions than Bednarek's 26 over the previous two months. This is how he compares to this season's best central defender: Makes fewer passes and has fewer touches, which is understandable seeing as how he plays at Southampton rather than Manchester City, but when he does move the ball around he takes play forward. The vision spike suggests he is the sort of ball-playing defender who could easily fit into a better/higher-up-the-table team. Only played five times in the two months but made a massive difference to Arsenal, as he always seems to. Forget the defensive bite he clearly adds at the back; the attacking overlapping runs he makes and determined tackling high up the pitch is something that team has needed for years. Steps up in the big games too, registering an assist in the North London derby.  Even if Mount's statistics aren't particularly impressive, he brings an energy, desire and quality to the first team that others simply can't match. Scored three goals in nine games for Chelsea. Has been a busy boy, making 30 saves (the fourth most of any goalkeeper) with a save percentage of 81.08 per cent. Anything lower than that might have resulted in West Brom already being relegated. Has also registered more 'passes', if we can call them that, into the final third than any other goalie.  Not entirely sure anyone saw this coming but Jesse Lingard has been superb for West Ham since joining and scored five goals and provided two assists in seven games over February and March, helping earn important wins over Spurs and Aston Villa in particular. He was the best player on the park in the Villa game. Leicester's midfield is one of the best in the league and perfectly balanced. A big reason for that is the way Tielemans combines defensive and attacking work into one role - like a proper midfielder is supposed to. Is more a player you appreciate watching rather than spotting on a data sheet. Didn't do anything spectacular or record any particularly impressive individual statistics but was essential to Leicester holding onto third place in the league. Antonio is either severely underrated or suffering from 'great player not at a top six club' syndrome. Never seems to get the praise he's due but will receive it here, especially after his four assists and two goals in seven games for West Ham, who are FIFTH! FIFTH! How has this happened?! Scored four goals in nine games for Everton, taking his tally for the season to six and securing vital wins over West Brom and Southampton to keep hopes of a European finish alive. Is only 23-years-old, despite it feeling like he's in his prime and due a move to an even bigger club.  Ridiculously good against Southampton and West Ham, De Bruyne has scored twice and provided one assist. Other players have higher numbers - Phil Foden is one example - but the way De Bruyne dictates play and drives the team forward is consistently impressive. It's almost as if we don't realise quite how talented he is at times, specifically when his numbers aren't as high as we've become accostomed to. Brought in as a strike partner to Jamie Vardy, who has struggled for form of late, Iheanacho has justified his manager's tactical tweaks by scoring more goals than any other player in the league since February. Iheanacho has six goals in six games, including a hat-trick against Sheffield United and not including the two goals plus one assist he registered in the FA Cup against Manchester United. Has been rejuvenated under the current Man Utd coaching regime into a top level left-back. Shaw's overlapping attacking runs have added a new dimension to United's forward play and he is regularly directly involved in the final third, creating 17 chances in open play - the same as Bruno Fernandes. Registered four assists (joint most with Michail Antonio) and scored one goal. Kane's tally for the season stands at 17 goals and 13 assists, with a combined seven of those (five goals, two assists) coming over the last two months as Tottenham have struggled... then been great... then struggled again. Kane has been consistent throughout. Five goals and three assists for Fernandes over the last two months, and though he looks a little like a player who could do with a rest, Manchester United's instant drop in form when they do leave him on the bench means it simply can't happen. Instrumental and decisive every single time he plays.  Has been used as a box-to-box midfielder, a 'free eight', and a deep-lying playmaker in the past by Pep Guardiola, who has now discovered that the role of 'false nine' is another that Gundogan performs really well in. Five goals and one assist in eight games as part of a fluid, ever-interchanging forward line (and midfield too).",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/20-best-players-premier-league-power-rankings-februarymarch/
69,,"If you are a follower of both international and domestic rugby then last weekend you would have witnessed no finer example of one of rugby’s simmering plights. At a sun-kissed Kingsholm last Friday, Exeter scrum-half Stu Townsend convinced the world’s best referee, Luke Pearce, the official of the galactic scrap between Wales and France six days earlier, to check a potential try with his TMO. Pearce initially ruled that no try was scored, but following Townsend’s protestations he decided to review – because the scrum-half asked him to. The debate as to whether referees should allow players to dictate when to review is one for later – because it does happen. In Gloucester, however, Townsend was left with egg on his face as the footage showed a conclusive knock-on during his attempt to ground the ball. Around two hours later in Paris came a moment that so threateningly dichotomised the events at Kingsholm that it barely resembled the same sport.   in a madcap match and, with one authoritative blast, referee Wayne Barnes awarded the close-range score, adamant that it was legal. Except, Barnes had missed one of the most palpable double movements that he might ever miss. How Charles Ollivon, the magnificent French captain, wished that he could have kicked up a fuss like Townsend; how he wished that the communication channel between anglophone referee and francophone player was nearer to Eurotunnel fluidity than last week’s Suez Canal. Ollivon flapped and waved but the language barrier meant that his primitive pleading methods were always going to be in vain. “C’est bien pour moi,” said Barnes. Back you go, discussion over, bonne nuit. The try stood, with France facing the ignominy of watching its dubiousness on the stadium’s screens. The greater injustice, however, was that unlike Townsend, Les Bleus were powerless to stop it. The try stood, in essence, because Ollivon could not appeal. Scotland’s five points might still have – incorrectly – remained after review, but that is moot. If Townsend can dictate, then France should also be able to. The fact that they could not because of a language barrier lends scant credibility to ‘World’ Rugby’s grand designs of a global game.   Critics might claim the argument for Ollivon improving his English is as penetrative as demanding officials to improve their language skills, but to what end? France picking a captain on the strength of their English? France have previously employed some daft selection criteria, but that would be blindingly disadvantageous even for them. The onus for linguistic development is on referees rather than players given World Rugby’s insistence on incessant on-field communication from officials; with the microphones, the interminable instructions on what to do and when, and the matey miens. Given that, it verges on preposterous to appoint a referee who cannot converse fluently with both teams. Imagine if it were the English captain in Ollivon’s doomed shoes, the player unable to converse with a referee who barely spoke English. Now imagine such an incident costing England a try in a championship-deciding match; then imagine the ensuing furore. This might be a baby elephant in rugby’s capacious room, but it is still an elephant. It is 11 years since a senior team captained by a native French-speaker claimed a trophy outside of France’s domestic competitions, when Toulouse flanker Thierry Dusautoir lifted both the Heineken Cup and the Six Nations crown. How decisive these unqueried decisions have been to France’s success is immeasurable, but the quantity of matches they continue to win despite the barrier says much about the splendour of this nouvelle vague. Seven of the eight Champions Cup last-16 matches this weekend feature French teams, too; not one of those will be officiated by a native French speaker, or anyone who is near to ‘fluency’. Pearce, Barnes among others have made a commendable effort to improve, but their knowledge is so basic that it is almost facile; a tick-box exercise to keep the linguistic wolves from the door. What is notable is that every professional French and Italian referee speaks better English than their anglophone counterparts do French or Italian. A third of the Six Nations is non-anglophone, with a similar split domestically: how is the current situation even vaguely fair or even vaguely living up to those mythical ‘rugby values’? Multiple languages are often cited as mandatory in multinational corporate roles. Considering the multitude of nationalities playing elite rugby, it is time for ‘World’ Rugby to mirror its corporate chums, shatter the anglophone hegemony of its officials, and recruit more polyglots.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/04/02/language-barrier-rugby-has-never-come-close-breaking/
70,Steve Bruce set to keep his job at Newcastle - on one condition,"Newcastle United could offer Steve Bruce a new contract if he keeps the club in the Premier League with owner Mike Ashley   to his underfire manager this week. Bruce will have one year left on his current contract at the end of the season and while a poll in the local newspaper   showed that 95 per cent of the 14,000 supporters who took part wanted him to be replaced after the 3-0 humiliation at Brighton, it is understood   as long as the club are not relegated to the Championship. Asked what Ashley had said to him this week, Bruce replied: “The owner hasn't had to say [anything] at all.  “You know, he sent his support to rally the troops and to get behind everybody. But, as I've said from day one, nothing's changed. I have an everyday rapport with the CEO [Lee Charnley] and that's who I report to day in and day out. That's the way it is. “It’s up to other people to decide [if I am still the manager next season]. I can only focus on the next nine games, which I'm going to be, and relying on that experience, which I've drawn upon over the last 20-odd years, because I'll need it over this testing time.  “I'm determined to see it [my contract] through. I hope I'm still the manager of Newcastle next year, [but] that's for others to decide."" United are currently fourth from bottom ahead of the arrival of Tottenham Hotspur to St James’ Park on Sunday, just two points above Fulham. However, Bruce’s remit when he was given the job in July 2019 was to keep Newcastle in the Premier League and despite a disappointing second season in charge, if he can get enough points from the remaining nine games to preserve top-flight status, he will have done what the club wanted him to do. As things stand, there are no immediate plans to negotiate a new deal as the situation remains so uncertain, but if Newcastle avoid relegation, discussions will have to take place because Bruce will only have 12 months left on his contract, which does not help with long-term planning. The club could even offer an extended deal on a better wage, but with a less generous compensation package if he is sacked.  Bruce is currently entitled to a pay-off estimated at around £4 million if he is sacked and that figure is believed to rise again if he enters the third year of his contract. The former Manchester United captain was once again defiant in the face of more stinging criticism since the Brighton debacle, insisting he paid little attention to the  poll. “I've said many, many times, everybody's entitled to their opinion,” he added. “I really can't take any notice of polls. All I can focus on is Tottenham at the weekend, get the squad the best prepared as I possibly can, and get ready for the challenge and not take any notice of any polls. “Of course, all of this has been tough, full stop. When you take the Newcastle job, you know it's going to be tough. There's no shying away from it. ""You rely on your family, of course, your staff, who work with you tirelessly to try and put it right, and also you draw on the experience.  “If you do 980-odd games [as a manager] or whatever, there's a fair amount of experience there. In some people's eyes, I wouldn't have thought I'd done half-a-dozen [games in management]. So you draw on that experience.” The thought of Bruce remaining as Newcastle manager next season, let alone the prospect of him being offered a new contract, will dismay many on Tyneside. But if Bruce manages to guide the club out of relegation danger, the likelihood is he will keep his job - regardless of how unpopular he is with fans - unless he decides he has had enough of the constant abuse and resigns. Given Bruce’s character and the fact this is the job he has always wanted since he became a manager, a resignation seems unlikely. He has stressed to staff repeatedly, as well as in the media, that he will not walk away from the fight. That, though, is precisely what he has in front of him. He has nine games to save the team from relegation and his job. If he fails to keep Newcastle up, he will surely not be given the chance to try and win promotion from the Championship. However, Ashley has been unflinchingly loyal to Bruce throughout a turbulent 20-month reign and has shown once again since the Brighton defeat that he will not be pressured by fans into making a decision on a manager he likes and respects for the way he has conducted himself in the face of severe opposition. Should Newcastle play as badly as they did against Brighton against Spurs, there will be a decision to make and Ashley will discuss things again with managing director Charnley, but as things stand, the plan is to give Bruce until the end of the campaign. And if the 60 year-old can somehow rescue his second season from disaster, there will need to be at least preliminary talks about a new deal if he is going to remain in charge. Newcastle opened new contract talks with Bruce’s predecessor, Rafa Benitez, when he entered the final 12 months of his deal. Tellingly, although little recruitment planning can take place while Newcastle do not know what division they will be in next season, the discussions that have occurred have all involved Bruce. There will not be a lot of money to spend as Newcastle have struggled with the impact of having no fans inside stadiums - depriving the club of income of around £1m each home game - and Bruce is aware of that and has been working accordingly. The prospect of low season ticket sales with Bruce continuing as manager will be the only thing likely to push Ashley into sacking him. But the fact the business has remained solid - albeit with little money to spend in the transfer market - make even this threat less crucial than it would have been before the pandemic. Ashley intends to sell the club if he can and as long as Bruce keeps Newcastle in the Premier League - and justifies the £340m price tag - the owner will probably want to at least give him a chance to win over fans at the start of a new campaign.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/steve-bruce-set-keep-job-newcastle-one-condition/
71,How the top four race is shaping up - and why fear is driving force for 'Big Six' contenders,"In the annual scrap for the Premier League’s top four places, it is often the fear of failure that proves to be the greatest motivating factor. Six into four simply will not go, and at the start of each campaign there is a sense of dread within the so-called ‘Big Six’ over which of their number might fall short. In this most challenging of seasons, both financially and physically, that terror is especially prevalent. The cost of missing out on the Champions League  for the traditional powerhouses of the English game, starved of their matchday revenues and desperate for the sweet relief of European cash. And yet this year’s race also carries an unfamiliar feel: there is a whiff of opportunity in the air, with the likes of West Ham United, Everton and possibly even Aston Villa still within sight of a prize they had no real right to target. As the Premier League’s 20 teams approach the final bend, there are at least seven sides with genuine hopes of filling the three positions behind runaway leaders Manchester City. From fourth to eighth, five clubs are separated by just five points. If Aston Villa win their game in hand, it will be six teams separated by just seven points. There is no doubt, then, where the drama will be found in the final few weeks.   should provide a few twists of its own, of course, but the real juiciness will be higher up the table, where so many varying plotlines will ultimately converge. It is   that make this race quite so interesting, opening up a slot that - alongside runaway leaders Manchester City - you would normally expect to be unavailable.  In their stead Manchester United and Leicester City might think themselves safely ensconced in the top four, with gaps of eight and seven points respectively to fifth-placed West Ham, although it is still far too early for them to stop looking over their shoulders. For Leicester, especially, the memories of last season will be nagging at their minds. They won just two of their final nine league fixtures last year,   when Champions League football was just a few strides away. On Saturday they meet City, before a trip to West Ham and then a formidable final three games against Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in May. Another stumble will hurt Leicester badly, and would do some considerable damage  , but in the wider picture they at least remain one of the sides with more to gain than lose from this top four fight. The same can certainly be said of Everton and, to an even greater extent, West Ham. The prospect of even securing Europa League football would have been laughed off by most West Ham fans at the start of this season. For David Moyes this campaign is therefore already a guaranteed success, regardless of the final outcome. They can play with a genuine freedom in these final few weeks, and that makes them dangerous. On the sliding scale of doom, West Ham sit on the opposite end to the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool. And this is before one even considers Arsenal, whose struggles over the past four seasons have shown what can happen when a big side falls out of the Champions League places.  Arsenal’s fortunes will serve as a warning to the more established members of the crumbling ‘Big Six’. The longer you are out of the Champions League, the harder it is to get back in. Arsenal are showing   while their rivals continue to invest, increasing the gap and generating doubts over their long-term status as one of the country’s biggest clubs. The fear at Anfield, where Liverpool’s “self-sustaining” model is theoretically the same as Arsenal’s, will be that even one year outside of Europe’s premier competition could trigger a similar decline. This season’s extenuating circumstances — namely the number of injuries they have suffered — suggests they will have the strength to bounce back next time around, but momentum can be hard to regain when it has been lost. ""We don't have a lot of points to waste anymore but we have a tough programme on top of that, not only in the Premier League but the Champions League as well,"" said Jurgen Klopp, whose Liverpool side visit Arsenal on Saturday. ""We will not hesitate, we will just go for it and hopefully we can do that. We have one session to bring it all together again [after the international break] and that's a challenge but we are used to it. There is no guarantee it works but we will go for it."" Those same concerns will be shared by Tottenham, for whom the pandemic could not have come at a worse time. They are only just beginning to pay off the debts on their shiny, but empty, new stadium. Would Jose Mourinho  ? Would Harry Kane stick around for another season outside of football’s most illustrious competition? ""I’m not going to be pessimistic or try to anticipate scenarios and evaluate our season before it ends,"" said Mourinho on Friday. ""I’m confident we can win on Sunday and if on Monday you ask me, I’ll be confident we can win against Man United next week and I can repeat every match this confidence and ambition to win the next match. ""To reach a Champions League position, we depend on results from other teams, I’m not going to say we’re going to do it or not. We have to go one game at a time."" Injuries, fixtures and European distractions will all play their part in determining which clubs make it over the line. Leicester and Tottenham might ultimately feel grateful to have been knocked out of the Europa League, for example, while Liverpool and Chelsea will need to find a way of balancing their domestic commitments with their Champions League ambitions. Above all, though, this is a contest that will be won by the teams who are most capable of coping with the strange demands of this weird campaign. West Ham have so far done so brilliantly (albeit they have been helped by having no European fixtures) while Liverpool have struggled more than any other big side in the Premier League. There are so many factors to consider, and so many circumstances that could yet change, but one thing feels certain: once again, it is the battle for the top four that will provide the most exciting moments of the Premier League finale.  Unbeaten since Jan 27. Back-to-back wins against Manchester City and West Ham means second, not fourth, must be the target. Marcus Rashford withdrew from the England squad but will not be out for long. Mason Greenwood is another short-term doubt. United are deep into the Europa League and, with Granada next in the quarter-finals, would expect to progress further.  talent  .

After four straight bottom-half finishes, West Ham’s owners will be borderline delirious at their lofty position.

Jordan Henderson, Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez remain long-term absentees, though Roberto Firmino should be fit to feature this weekend.  The Champions League   given the comfortable wins over RB Leipzig provided momentum at a much-needed time. It could end up being their best bet of European qualification for next season.  The recent losses to Brighton, Manchester City, Leicester, Everton, Chelsea and Fulham saw Liverpool score just three goals. If they’re to stand a chance, they need   at his lethal best.

72,,"Officially, June 21 is circled in calendars as  . The wording of the Government’s roadmap, specifying the removal of “all legal limits on social contact” on that date, promises to make this year’s summer solstice – a day when every pagan, druid and hedonist with a headpiece flocks to Stonehenge to greet the rising sun – a bacchanal like no other. Only it seems that Wimbledon, which begins on June 28 and is thus the first major British sports event to be  , has yet to receive the memo. If the All England Club truly seeks to usher us confidently into the post-Covid age, then it has a curious way of showing it. The beloved queue for show-court tickets is to be scrapped out of a fear that it will flout social-distancing requirements. Attendance on site is likely to be “reduced”. Even the cherished tradition that permits top players to rent private houses in Wimbledon village, rather than staying in faceless city-centre hotels, is being scrapped. To think, this is the one spectacle designed to symbolise the garden-party charms of high summer, the one occasion that should herald the country’s emergence into the light. And yet by subjecting the fortnight to the same restrictions that have immiserated us for the past 13 months, organisers risk losing any joy, simply to be seen to comply with guidelines that no longer apply. This week, John Isner called out the purple-and-green ties for their over-abundance of caution. “As the situation seems to be getting better around the world, there are some questions,” said the American, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2018 and the winner of its longest ever match. “Can the bubble environment be lessened a little? Can the players have a little more freedom? I would like to have the responsibility fall on players to be careful and to take care of themselves.” Individual choice? In the UK? In 2021? Now there is a radical idea. It will never catch on. Given that the tennis commentariat leans heavily towards a stay-safe orthodoxy, Isner tends to be dismissed as a crank. When he played in a team event in Atlanta last July with limited spectators, one East Coast writer described the tournament as “crazy” and “out-of-touch”. Isner shot back at him for spreading “spooky headlines”, while rounding on another critic with the immortal line: “You coronabros can stay in your basement all you want.” But in his objections to this year’s Wimbledon set-up, he is entirely correct. It is not just that Isner, like many elite athletes, is tiring of living out every competition in a sterile bubble, bound by invasive protocols. It is not just that he despairs of the quarantine arrangements, withdrawing from the Australian Open in protest at the notion of being locked in a hotel room for 14 days. It is that he and his fellow pros are still being treated like children, that even when vaccination numbers are bounding forward in the UK and the US, he is still not at liberty to book his own London accommodation in three months’ time. The absurdity does not end there. Wimbledon is planning to enforce a laundry list of rules beyond the point where it is legally compelled to do so. There can be few more vivid illustrations of how far the precautionary principle has seeped into national life: that even when lawmakers tell sport’s governing bodies restrictions can be lifted, they are still kept in place, just to be on the safe side. The Government’s wording on Stage Four of lockdown release is bullish. June 21 marks the final step, as the Prime Minister puts it, of the country’s “one-way road to freedom”, a point at which even nightclubs and concert venues are allowed to reopen. Tennis’ response, alas, is dispiritingly timid. Wimbledon, as a wholly outdoors experience – give or take the odd session under the Centre Court roof – falls into a lower category of risk. Infection rates are plummeting, almost all adults are due to have received a first vaccine dose come late June, and all freedoms are scheduled to be restored by the championships’ opening Monday. But to read through their “conditions of entry for Covid-19” is to be reminded of every dystopian reality through which we have been living. One of the core principles, the document states, is to create a safe environment based on face coverings and social-distancing. So much for the Government’s message that social contact can fully resume. These mitigation measures are no longer just about the science. They are, above all, about the look. You see the inconsistencies everywhere in sport: the rule that Formula One drivers must conduct interviews through masks even though they have returned multiple negative tests just to enter the paddock, or the edict that Six Nations players must stand two metres apart for the national anthems, even as they prepare to bury their heads into each other’s groins at the first breakdown. Always, the justification is that sport must be perceived as setting an example. Any common sense, or the idea that most people can be trusted to give space without needing Owen Farrell to show them how, flies out of the window. Even as lockdown nears its end, sport is in danger of being paralysed by its safety-first philosophy. It is different in music, where the Leeds and Reading Festivals intend to proceed this summer without any restrictions. Would that Wimbledon could convey the same optimism. It has a chance this year to be a bridge to a post-Freedom Day future, but instead it seems determined to sustain the privations of a ghastly recent past.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/04/02/wimbledons-timid-response-great-unlocking-shows-sport-risks/
73,Tactical substitutes to be trialled in first-class cricket — and why this devalues the sport,"The International Cricket Council will allow tactical substitutions in first-class cricket in a move that could radically alter the sport after the Cricket Committee sanctioned the general use of replacement players. Substitutions have traditionally been barred in first-class cricket, even in the case of injury though the ICC permitted concussion substitutes to be allowed in first-class games from 2017 and  , with replacements now also sanctioned if a player contracts Covid-19. But in a move that could completely change the landscape of the game worldwide, the ICC has mandated individual boards to trial the unlimited use of ""unqualified replacement players"" in first-class games, meaning substitutions can be made for tactical reasons.  Such a move could see the traditional concept of cricket as an 11-a-side game, with teams bound by selection decisions they make before the toss, completely altered. Had the rules been in place during England’s recent Test series in India, for instance, Joe Root would have been able to alter his XI during the match - notably when misreading the conditions and   as they succumbed to defeat within two days. Player substitutions were previously used in one-day international cricket from 2005-06, but were promptly scrapped after an unpopular trial period. The ICC has an open mind to how the trials should work. The new changes have been designed to get a better feel for which aspect of replacement player regulations work most effectively. Each member country will retain discretion as to how they want to run their first-class competitions. At this stage there is no indication of the County Championship,  , allowing tactical substitutes.  ""The recent introduction of replacement players for both concussion and Covid-19 prompted a discussion at the Cricket Committee on the more general use of replacement players in the international game,"" the ICC said in a statement. ""To better understand the implications of allowing players to be replaced during a match the definition of a First-Class Match will be changed to allow the unqualified use of replacement players."" Individual boards who trial tactical substitutions are free to set their own rules for how the rule could be used. For instance, teams could be limited to one tactical substitution per match, or only allowed to make substitutions at one point in the match - for instance, after both sides have batted once - to make the rule as fair as possible. Tactical substitutions could be one way of reducing the salience of the toss and home advantage, which are regarded as two concerns for the Test game. Another possibility is that they could encourage pace bowlers to remain in the Test game for longer - for instance, allowing 90mph bowlers to go at full pelt during one innings of a game, and reducing the risk of incurring injuries playing the longer format.   If the trial of tactical substitutions proves successful at domestic level, it could ultimately then be incorporated into Test cricket, just as  .  It is a preposterous proposal by the International Cricket Council to allow replacement players for reasons other than concussion and Covid. In fact it is the most preposterous proposal to alter the rules of cricket since the ICC sanctioned ""super-subs"" - the replacement of one player by another in the course of a one-day international. It may be little known but the super-sub experiment only came about by mistake: the ICC’s announcement was made public by an over-eager media manager before it had been approved by their executive board. Everyone went with it in ODIs, before the experiment was mercifully abandoned before the 2007 World Cup. The flaw in super-subs, and in replacement players for reasons other than concussion and Covid, is the same: it sabotages the dramatic tension which exists between two competing teams of equal numbers. The Trojan War would not exist in western folklore if Achilles had been replaced halfway through, and if, instead of Hector, the citizens of Troy had replaced him with a leader better at spear-rowing. The dramatic tension goes out the window; it is no longer a battle between equal forces. It is to be hoped that no country’s board will take up the ICC’s proposal even to experiment: ""To better understand the implications of allowing players to be replaced during a match the definition of a First-Class Match will be changed to allow the unqualified use of replacement players."" The unqualified use? Good grief, this could be interpreted to mean the starting XI can be replaced as the game goes on by an entirely new team. A side’s bowling attack is packed with seamers for the first half of the game then replaced by spinners for the second half.  How many caps were won by England players in their third Test against Mongolia? Nineteen.  We already understand, as things stand, the ""implications of allowing players to be replaced"". It is to devalue the sport.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/04/02/tactical-substitutes-trialled-first-class-cricket-new-icc-plans/
74,"John Inverdale exclusive: 'I know I'm a white, male Old Fart but diversity criticism is bonkers'","Some broadcasters go out with a teary fanfare on retirement: John Inverdale brought  with cold pepperoni pizza in a hotel lobby in Salford. The BBC’s rugby front-man across three decades will continue to operate in other sports such as tennis but has been obliged to step aside from the game that he “inherited from his father and is in his DNA” due to a conflict of interests now that he has accepted a role on the RFU as the representative for the 48 NCA clubs, the semi-professional tier below the Championship. The 63-year-old leaves to something of a mixed reaction, ranging from praise for the accomplished, versatile broadcaster that he undoubtedly is to relief elsewhere that the ‘male, pale and stale,’ set-up of the BBC’s panel of pundits is breaking up. “I absolutely endorse the need for diversity of race and gender but to get criticised for a recent line-up that included two Grand Slam winners [Sam Warburton and Jamie Roberts] and a World Cup-winning captain in Martin Johnson for the France-Wales game is bonkers,” said Inverdale.  “Of course there should be a Maggie Alphonsi on our screens but it is also about the context of the moment. I can see, too, that rugby does still have a perception issue, that it can be seen as a white, male, middle-class drinking enclave.  ""The game does need to sell itself better. We had audiences of seven-eight million over the last two weekends even though England [with the biggest constituency] were not the draw card. Where do all those people go? Not to their local rugby club. Perhaps we need to change the word ‘club,’ which can give off a forbidding air.  “I know I’m officially one of the RFU 'Old Farts' now [a reference to Will Carling's description of RFU committee men] and I'm white, male etc, but I can’t be anything other than how I was born. As Chris Evans was told by Terry Wogan when he took over that treasured slot on Radio 2, ‘Some will like you, some will not and there is nothing you can do about it.’” Inverdale has  , notably the “horrible and idiotic” use of language when describing French tennis player, Marion Bartoli, after she won Wimbledon in 2013. Inverdale suggested that Bartoli had no choice but to work harder as she was “never going to be a looker” - an incident which prompted a torrent of complaints, not least from the then-Culture Minister Maria Miller, and a grovelling apology, which Bartoli accepted. The pair have worked together since and are on good terms.  “It’s there, it happened, it was wrong,” says Inverdale, whose many other actions point to an individual who is actually supportive of gender rights, a point underlined by his robust defence of colleague, Sonja McLaughlan who went public with her anguish at being abused on social media for her post-match interview with Owen Farrell.  “The way she was treated was awful, just awful,” he says. “All power to her for the way she does what is one of the toughest gigs in broadcasting.” Inverdale has seen the BBC’s rugby portfolio diminish since the days when it was the sole broadcaster and he was the regular presenter on ‘Rugby Special’. In those days, he took to wearing a different rugby shirt each week to be more “down-to-earth, cool and inclusive”, the very things he is accused of not being these days. He was criticised by traditionalists for that look, too. When he got a call asking if he would consider taking over the NCA role, Inverdale weighed up the pros and cons. “Would I still be fronting rugby in eight years’ time (the length of his RFU position) when I am 71?” said Inverdale. “The answer to that is obvious. Could I go from poacher to gamekeeper by lending a critical perspective within the RFU for the future good of the sport? I’d like to think I can.  “Rugby is not without its issues but it is a fantastic sport, rooted in its communities, and offers so much. Broadcasting is changing. I would once go to the wall for free-to-air TV. Now that I have seen how many negative noughts there are on the RFU balance sheets, I can recognise another side to the argument.” Inverdale, by dint of age and profile, may not be seen as anything other than one of the RFU blazers but he is a progressive at heart. He has been involved at one of the NCA constituent clubs, Esher RFC, for over 30 years, battling to use their £1million turnover wisely. He rejects the notion that the game should revert to amateurism below a certain level to spare financial hardship, arguing that it would stymie “investment and aspiration”. He notes that club facilities, “leaky, smelly loos and the like”, need to be upgraded at many clubs if they are to attract new members as well as players. The semi-pro clubs should consider more “Friday nights under lights” fixtures to free up weekends. “Rugby has to become more flexible and adaptable,” said Inverdale. “That’s the way of the modern age - for instance, to watch TV when you want, and not when schedules dictate. I want to help make rugby more accessible, more inclusive, more appealing and if that all sounds a bit hippy happy-clappy I make no apologies.  “Concussion is an issue that needs addressing, obviously, and if it means making tackling below the knee obligatory, then so be it. Who knows, football might need to ban heading if it prevents early onset dementia?  “I had a letter from a lady the other week asking if she should spread her husband’s ashes at Esher. I asked her why and she replied that in the early 50s he had played for Esher’s 15th XV and they had been the happiest days of his life. Well, much has changed but if we can keep that connection, that sense of enjoyment, for the next 70 years then we will be on the right path.” An Old Fart with a modern sensibility.   ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/04/02/john-inverdale-exclusive-know-white-male-old-fart-diversity/
75,The Secret Science of Sewage may turn you green… in a good way,"We’re at the sewage works and presenter Zoe Laughlin has just declared that it’s “time for a poo”. She’s opening a tub, surely it’s not going to contain… oh, thank goodness, it’s a poo substitute. Made from soya bean paste, which apparently is “industry standard for simulating turds in the toilet”. Well, you learn something new every day. If you’re about to stop reading in disgust then I don’t imagine you sat through   (BBC Two). I can’t blame you and neither can the show’s main host, Dr George McGavin, because as he explained: the sight and smell of human waste is “something we’re hard-wired to avoid”. We’re also programmed, as adults, to consider all this poo talk to be the preserve of five-year-old boys. And yet, if you had watched it, you might have found this Horizon film to be pretty interesting. It showed us how a sewage works operates – this one on the outskirts of Birmingham – but also explored ways in which all this waste could be harnessed for treating disease and charging your mobile phone. If surveys on social media are to be believed, an inordinate amount of children were taken on school trips to the local sewage works. Let’s hope all the visits were enlivened by the presence of an employee like the one who appeared here to describe the particular delights of his job, including administering a machine that sieves out large bits of matter from the river of raw sewage: “When you open it up and see a dead rat hanging by its tail, it’s still a bit of a shocker.” Ok, enough of the grim stuff. The mobile phone powered by pee was a fascinating idea, using the live bacteria in urine to generate electricity. The professor responsible for the project believes it could be scaled up and included in the fabric of houses. McGavin described it as “a ubiquitous and never-ending” fuel source. Other uses for the stuff found in  our sewage was mooted: powering cars, killing off deadly superbugs.  A woman turned up whose job was described as “sludge scientist”.  When did this programme get too much for me? It may have been when they discussed the “spicy top-notes” you could smell at the plant, or when they yelped with delight at the sight of micro-organisms – blown up on a screen to look like monsters – eating tiny particles of… well, you can guess.

76,What it's like to be on the forgotten frontline of the Covid crisis,"The Great British Easter weekend traditionally brings us out of our homes, not only to gardens and the countryside, but also to the shops. Suddenly, we discover our collective appetite for unseasonal barbecues and overly ambitious DIY projects. We urgently need a leg of lamb to roast, Easter eggs for all the children we might be at risk of encountering, and enough wine to get us through it all.  This year will be no different, as the country rushes gratefully towards something more like normality than anything we’ve experienced in a while. And as we head to the supermarket to stock up, we’ll probably pay little heed to those manning the checkouts and shop floors. They’ll just be there as always, quietly doing their job. Many shop workers, however, have had the roughest of rides this past year, receiving torrents of abuse for attempting to enforce the various pandemic rules. Claire Saunders, manager of a small supermarket in Romford, Essex, is among those regularly exposed to shoppers’ wrath and frustration. “I got called a f------ c--- just for asking someone to wait outside until someone else had left,” says the 40-year-old.  Similar has happened when she has politely reminded customers to stick to the one-way system in-store, designed to make the shop safer during the Covid crisis. “You get a mouthful of abuse, people saying ‘I do what I want, I don’t care,’” she says. “During the first lockdown I walked down an aisle and there was a shoplifter putting stuff in his bag. He said ‘if you come any nearer I’ll spit on you and give you coronavirus.’” Saunders’ experiences are far from uncommon among shop staff. Earlier this year, retail trade union Usdaw released statistics  . Its survey of 2,729 UK shop workers found 88 per cent experienced verbal abuse, 61 per cent were threatened by a customer and nine per cent were assaulted. This, towards those who were putting their health on the line every day in customer-facing roles, while so many of us have been safely working from home. Launching a Parliamentary inquiry into crimes against shopworkers in December, Yvette Cooper MP, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, described the increase in reported attacks and abuse during the pandemic as “appalling and unacceptable”.  She added: “The crisis has shown how important shop workers are as key workers – keeping vital services going during difficult times.” Yet according to Saunders, the longer the pandemic has continued, the harder the job has become. “This [past year] is the worst time I’ve ever experienced,” she says. “It’s always been there, abuse of shop workers, but Covid has heightened it. It’s provided a flashpoint for abuse. I’ve seen it all.” Difficult customers range from young people who refuse to wear masks because they think the virus won’t harm them, to shoppers of any age who deny the existence of Covid and the need for restrictions. On the forgotten frontline of retail, shop staff are left to police it all. Abuse isn’t all they have faced. In January, Office for National Statistics figures showed  . By the end of 2020, 135 workers in these positions had died with the virus in England and Wales.  But spreading it to loved ones may be an even greater worry. So anxious was Saunders about her young daughter catching Covid from her at the start of the pandemic, she routinely removed all her work clothes in the porch on arriving home, and dashed straight up to the shower. “It’s mentally draining as well,” she says. Her anxiety deepened during the second wave as case numbers in her area soared. David Williams, who works in St James’s Dairy, his family’s independent grocery store in Ilfracombe, Devon, spent much of the year worrying about his mother. “She was at risk and should have been isolating but she’s had to work in the shop,” says the 23-year-old. “We’ve put our lives on the line. If we didn’t, we’d have no business. It’s a risk, and it’s stressful. But we’ve got people who rely on us, so we’ve got to do our best.”  He, too, has encountered difficult customers during the pandemic year. “We get abuse about once every two weeks or so. You say, ‘Can you wait outside a minute?’ and they say ‘Right, I won’t shop here.’” In one incident, a young man who claimed he was exempt from wearing a mask started fake-coughing when challenged by Williams and another customer. “There was [another] incident where a man grabbed my crown jewels,” says Williams, 23. “He’d threatened my staff so I said ‘can you move on please?’ He said ‘are you a  man?’ and grabbed me.” In this instance, the police were called and the man was fined. Williams sighs: “It just makes challenging times more challenging when people don’t want to co-operate. When it happens, you do get upset. I would hope after this that people have more respect for the key workers. These people have carried on working while you’ve been at home watching Netflix.” The same is true of delivery drivers, who clock up hundreds of miles a day on the roads so others can stay at home. Frontline medical staff may be seen as heroic, but those who bring us our groceries and parcels are often taken for granted. Anecdotal evidence suggests they are far less likely to receive abuse than shop workers. But it’s easy to forget our online shopping habit relies on an army of low-earning drivers criss-crossing the county to bring us whatever we fancy.  Emma Manton, 42, started a nine-month stint as a driver for delivery firm Hermes last March after her work as an actress was halted by Covid. She was paid between 55p and £2 per parcel, depending on the size, and delivered between 60 and 150 a day, around south east London. “It’s not big money,” she says. “About £50 a day was a good day.” Still, she was glad to be working, and “on the whole people were very grateful. For some, I was the only person they would speak to all day. One thing I did find to start with was a lot of people, because I’m white and middle class, assumed I was their neighbour rather than the delivery driver.” She used her own car, and initially spent around eight hours a day delivering 100 parcels. “By the end I had it down to about four hours so then the hourly rate feels a little better,” she says. Nevertheless, it’s been hard for the mother of one to make ends meet on this money. “It’s been a hell of a struggle,” she says. “We had to take mortgage holidays.” For many isolated, lonely customers, contact with delivery drivers can be a vital lifeline, however. Geoff Norris, an Asda driver from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, knows this well. The 53-year-old father-of-two goes out of his way to help vulnerable and elderly people on his rounds, and even visited one isolated customer on Christmas Day because she wouldn’t have seen anyone else. “There are hundreds and hundreds of customers who really do appreciate it,” he says.  He is among the Asda drivers who have donned one of the supermarket’s “Happy to chat” badges, to let the lonely know they can talk to him while he’s delivering their groceries. “These people aren’t seeing anyone on a weekly, even a monthly, basis. Some say they haven’t seen anyone else except me and the postman in the past two months,” says Norris. He is committed to the job despite his 22-year-old daughter (who lives with him) being in remission from stage 3 cancer and therefore critically at risk. He could have taken the time off. “But there was no way we were ever going to do that,” he says. “My daughter said ‘you’re a lot more use out there.’” In October he was awarded a British Empire Medal in the Queen’s Birthday Honours for his help to the local community. Most delivery drivers toil without such acknowledgement. But there are signs the crucial part played during the pandemic by some of those with the least prestigious jobs is gaining recognition. Lidl promised a one-off bonus of £200 to its supermarket staff, cleaners, warehouse staff and customer assistants to thank them for their hard work during the Covid crisis. Usdaw would like to see more than just financial recompense.  , says: “The Government must prioritise vulnerable occupations in the second phase of the vaccine rollout, reflecting the risks they face. They have worked throughout the pandemic to keep the country supplied with essentials and these key workers must be valued, respected and protected.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/like-forgotten-frontline-covid-crisis/
77,Justin Rose interview: 'Golf's distance obsession will shorten careers',"As that fabled 17-year-old amateur who finished fourth at the Open in 1998, it is fair to say that Justin Rose knows a bit about youth golf and turning prodigy into glory, and that is why he is the perfect champion to headline the Telegraph Junior Golf Championship. It is also why the sport and its wannabes should listen when he warns about the current  .  Rose goes into next week’s Masters acutely aware that there is a burgeoning and bludgeoning revolution taking place as the young guns storm the elite. Bryson DeChambeau is at its vanguard and the reigning US Open champion will once again arrive in Georgia attempting to reduce Amen Corner to a few “Hail Marys”. The bombs of Bryson and the likes of Matthew Wolff and Cameron Champ will no doubt explode into the headlines and catch the attention of juniors with their sights set on an eye-stretching future. But Rose would like to ask them a few questions.  “Is it the short term or the long term they are thinking of when it comes to their time as a professional?” Rose asks. “Because with some of these swings nowadays, I’m not sure it can be both.” Those lucky ones who qualify for the finals of the Justin Rose Telegraph Junior Golf Championship at Walton Heath in October will get to meet the former world No 1 in person and benefit from his major-winning experience. “I will certainly advise caution if they are dead set on emulating what they see on TV, with these 200mph ball speeds and 400-yard drives” he says. “Because we are dealing with a lot of unknowns and we don’t know yet the toll this will take on the body. The more force we generate, the more force the body has to absorb. The torque is incredible. “If you look at my generation – say me, Adam Scott and Sergio [Garcia], we are probably the first wave that’s grown up with the fitness and physio side and I kind of feel we’re in the sweet spot, the way we approached the game in the last 20 years, focusing on our mobility and flexibility and looking at the big picture. And I think our best golf could well be in front of us, as weird as that is to say with us all in our forties. “Whereas, I feel like the generation coming up behind us is pushing the limit much harder than we did from a physical point of view and even though science is improving and we are understanding more and more about the body, eventually those aggressive motions have to take their impact. “If it carries on like this, and if everyone coming out here is looking for the power game, then maybe careers will get shorter and there won’t be players in their forties still able to compete at the top of the sport. “Apart from the physical issues that might be suffered, I think that would be a huge shame. Watching Westy [Lee Westwood] and Bryson going at it at Bay Hill [last month] was great because you had a 47-year-old taking on a 27-year-old. That sort of battle between the generations is unique to golf. “Westy and what he has done in the last year and a half is a huge inspiration. It’s a great part of what I love about golf. Lee is playing with wisdom and experience and gratitude. They are powerful words, but there is something so noble about it. That longevity and endless hunger should be celebrated, and it is. That is my concern with this drive for length – the professional male game could lose all that.” Rose points to USPGA champion Collin Morikawa as an ideal role model for the young pro to follow. “He has an iron game to die for,” Rose says. “I admire all of the young players, but Collin is like Tommy [Fleetwood] in that he is so good to watch. Both of them are so free and easy and will be around a long time.” The irony is that Rose himself is just emerging from an injury, but then when you have been a professional golfer for 23 of the 41 years you have been on the planet, the niggles are surely unavoidable.  Just when his form had turned around with a runner-up finish at Saudi Arabia after a poor 2020 – that saw him fall from eighth in the world to 35th – so a back spasm forced him to withdraw midway through the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. “I could have played the Players [the following week] at a stretch, no pun intended, and the WGC Match Play last week, but I thought to myself ‘what do I want from my career nowadays?’ ” Rose says. “No disrespect to any other competition, but what drives me now is majors, Ryder Cups, the Olympics.  “So, I thought I would recover fully and concentrate purely on the Masters. I’m single-mindedly going after this one and to have that approach is an interesting experiment in a sense. I’ve definitely never had five weeks off before a major before. Who knows, it might work.” Rose will sign in at Augusta on Saturday, although he has played the course several times in the past three weeks. “I have done so in my head, in real time, sat in my trophy room for inspiration, visualising each shot and what it will be like,” he says. “The sights, sounds and smells. I play maybe four holes at a time and yes, I do invariably play them well. However, this is a maddening game and there is a great story of [South African player] Jeff Hawkes, who had to give up visualising rounds when he kept shooting 74 in them. I do have good memories of Augusta, though.” Rose has led or held a share of the lead after each of the four rounds at Augusta, with his play-off defeat against Garcia in 2017 still fresh in the memory. “I know the place, know what it takes and can get it round there even when not at my best,” Rose says. “Last year, I was playing absolutely rubbish, but when I birdied the second on the Saturday I was one shot off the lead. That gives me confidence that if my second major is to come anywhere it could well be there.” Rose is back with swing coach Sean Foley and wants to put last year firmly in his rear-view mirror. “It wasn’t good on the course, but off it, there were positives, including   which Kate [his wife] and I set up to give the British female pros somewhere to play. “With the Junior Championship, it is great to put back something into the sport that has given me so much and it’s fun and satisfying to be involved. But I’d be lying if I said that the motivation to get up in the morning is anything other than improving my golf game. When that desire is not there, it will be time to pack. But it still burns and, honestly, nowhere does it burn more fiercely than at the Masters.”  ",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2021/04/02/justin-rose-interview-golfs-distance-obsession-will-shorten/
78,Carbon kitemarks to help shoppers make green choice,"The Government is to introduce a low-carbon kitemark to enable consumers to choose greener products, as it aims to cut industrial emissions by two-thirds in 15 years, the business secretary will announce today.  A new Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will also commit more than £1 billion to help install solar panels, LED lights and insulation to help schools, hospitals and councils to go green. It will also look at carbon pricing to ensure industry takes pollution into their business decisions, and invest £171 million for low carbon technology including carbon capture usage and storage projects in nine industrial areas across the north, Scotland and south Wales. The strategy forms part of the Government’s response to industry-led calls for more support to decarbonise in the face of competition from  and as part of its  Heavy industry is one of the most polluting sectors in the UK, with industries such as steel a particular challenge to decarbonise. The Government said it would look at targets for ore-based steelmaking to reach near-zero emissions by 2035. It also said it would also look at mechanisms to mitigate against “carbon leakage”, which can occur as either polluting industries move abroad or domestic industry is outpriced by  “We were the first major economy to put into law our target to end our contribution to climate change, and today we’re taking steps to be the first major economy to have its own low-carbon industrial sector,” said Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business and Energy Secretary. “While reaching our climate targets will require extensive change across our economy, we must do so in a way that protects jobs, creates new industries and attracts inward investment – without pushing emissions and business abroad.” Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, the manufacturers’ organisation, said: “The promise of financial help is critical. “Britain’s big corporations have large, ring-fenced budgets for green initiatives, but our smaller firms will need support to make sure they are able to make the changes necessary to ensure the UK meets its carbon targets and that they can benefit from the dramatic changes to the way industry will work in the coming years.” Green groups welcomed the Government’s commitment to emissions reductions within the next 15 years, but called for more ambition. Roz Bulleid, deputy policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The commitment to look at near zero ore-based steelmaking by 2035 is welcome, but the country needs to move quickly if our steel industry is not to be left behind.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/17/carbon-kitemarks-help-shoppers-make-green-choice/
79,Energy customers to get automatic credit refunds in regulator plans,"Households would be automatically refunded any overpayments on energy bills in plans tabled by the regulator to end companies using customers’ money incorrectly. Under the current system, those who   by direct debit pay a fixed amount each month, typically overpaying in the summer months when usage is low in order to build up credit which can be drawn on throughout the winter. However, this can lead to companies holding extra cash at the end of the year and Ofgem, the industry regulator, estimated in 2018 that as much as £1.4bn was being held in surplus credit balances. The new process, which is now being consulted on, would mean suppliers would be required to refund any outstanding credit each year on the 12 month anniversary of the account being opened. Some firms already do this, but Ofgem said that in the majority of cases the onus is on the customer to claim back any extra cash. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: “These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers’ money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers’ money.   “This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.”  Ofgem said it is concerned that some suppliers may use customers' surplus credit balances to fund “otherwise unsustainable business practices”.  These could include relying on cash reserves to offer artificially low tariffs in the hope of quickly gaining new customers, but this comes with a risk that the company will collapse. More than 20 suppliers  , with the regulator appointing a new supplier to take over the supply of the affected customers.  However, the new firm must also take on responsibility for paying outstanding credit and can   from an industry levy. Ofgem said that 79 per cent of funds claimed from this pot were to cover credit balances. If adopted, the new system would come into force next year.  A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry trade body, said: “Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year.  “Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem’s proposals.  “We look forward to working with them and our members to find an industry-wide best practice approach that supports customers and works for suppliers.” Peter Earl, head of energy at switching website Comparethemarket.com, said: “Energy companies managing credit balances has long been a matter of confusion and complexity for households.  “Although there is often a focus on customers who are in debt to their supplier, these proposals to return credit balances in a timely manner should be welcomed, especially given the burden the past year has placed on people’s finances.” Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: “A certain amount of energy credit can be a useful cushion for consumers during the winter months, as it can soften the blow of bills spiking if they are using their heating more at a particular time.  “However, if a customer’s monthly bill is higher than it should be or the consumption is much less than expected, their supplier could be potentially hoarding hundreds of pounds of their money.” He said that, even though the new rules will not come into force until next year, people currently in credit with their supplier may be able to claim a refund.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/17/energy-customers-get-automatic-credit-refunds-regulator-plans/
80,,"With   and question marks lingering about Harry Kane’s Spurs future, there’s an ongoing debate about where both strikers rate in the Premier League era. For me, judgement must be based on three strict criteria. The first, obviously, is how many they have scored. When considering a list of the greatest goalscorers of the last 29 years, an impressive strike rate is a given. Some players demand inclusion in the top 10 because their prolific nature and all-round brilliance makes them impossible to ignore. However, when a career is fully assessed, that alone is not enough. That’s why the second consideration - the number of trophies won - must determine who features nearer the top, who is lower than expected, and who misses out completely. When studying the impact of modern strikers - and I should reiterate I am talking specifically about goalscorers rather than playmaking No 10s - my point of reference goes back to my youth. In the mid-80s, two of the most prodigious forwards were Ian Rush and Gary Lineker. I watched Lineker in all of his Everton home games and several away fixtures in 1985-86 when he scored 40 goals in 57 games in a single season. His feats for England - including the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup - secured his reputation. But he could never match or eclipse Rush. Why? Because of the third and most important criteria of all. We have to weigh up the timing of a striker’s goals, and their value to a successful trophy quest. Rush scored seven fewer than Lineker in 1986, but - as was the case throughout his Liverpool career - his contribution was the critical difference as his club won the biggest honours. Rush’s 12 goals in the last 16 games of that season, including two at Wembley in the FA Cup Final, secured ‘The Double’. Strikers who score the goals that define a team’s season - or in some cases a club’s era - must rate higher than those who earn congratulations for their personal milestones. With all that in mind, here are my top 10: Kane needs no reminder of  . It’s the reason he sneaks into this top 10, and why - given my selection criteria - some might ask whether he should be in at all given that strikers like Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Jamie Vardy, all of whom won major honours, miss out. Kane must be included because of the volume of goals. With 160 already, injury permitting he might break Alan Shearer’s modern league record and eclipse Wayne Rooney’s England tally. But the reality is this: Kane will not move any higher up this list without the biggest prizes. Then he will be challenging my top three. The fact he is tied into a long contract with Tottenham under a chairman who would demand an extraordinary fee for a striker approaching his late 20s means there is no guarantee a title-challenging club will meet his valuation.  It sometimes feels like Yorke and his strike partner from Manchester United’s 1999 treble campaign, Andy Cole, are the forgotten men in these lists. Yorke scored 29 in that historic season, one more than Cole, and won the Premier League Golden Boot. The immediate impact of Yorke following his move from Aston Villa is often overlooked, and his influence on that trophy-laden season alone is enough to earn him inclusion, including two against Inter Milan in the 1999 Champions League quarter-final, and the equaliser against Juventus in the second leg of the semi-final in Turin. That is why he edges out the United strikers who followed him like Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robin van Persie. Many will argue the Dutchmen were better players, but they didn’t have the same effect on United in terms of the number of trophies won. I imagine this will be the most contentious selection given my criteria. Suarez only won the League Cup during his time in England, enjoying his greatest triumphs with Barcelona. But no list of the greatest Premier League strikers is credible without him. In my opinion, there is only one striker better than him in the Premier League era. Suarez was a force of nature, and although the English title was elusive, no-one will argue that Liverpool were agonisingly close in 2014 because of his 31 goals in 33 games (no penalties). Had Liverpool got across the line, Suarez would be challenging for a top-four spot in this list and acclaimed for having the single-greatest impact on a Premier League season of any other footballer, let alone striker. As a former teammate, I can personally vouch for how extraordinary he was, and his strike rate was even more prolific than Shearer and Mohamed Salah.  In total, Cole scored 187 Premier League goals. For perspective, that’s third in the all-time list and more than Thierry Henry and Sergio Aguero. And unlike most No 9s, Cole did not take penalties. But Cole’s goal career went beyond hitting several notable personal landmarks. He lifted the Premier League an amazing five times during his six years at Manchester United. What elevates Cole above Yorke is his previous contribution at Newcastle where he scored 50 Premier League goals quicker than anyone, and his 34 league goals in 1993-94 remains the joint-highest in a single campaign. The more you assess what Cole did following his high-profile move from Tyneside to Manchester, the more you realise he has been neglected too often since his retirement. That may be because he had minimal impact for his country when compared to his clubs, but the medal haul counts here. Salah stands out on this list because, unlike everyone else on it, he is not and never has been a typical No 9. Deep strikers such as Eric Cantona and Dennis Bergkamp were not part of my consideration because of that, but Salah has to be an exception because his primary purpose during his Anfield career has been to score, and his statistics have been off the scale since he joined Liverpool. In each of his three seasons at Anfield he has won either the Golden Boot, the Champions League or the Premier League. He may do so again in 2021. We often talk about Virgil van Dijk being the signing who changed the course of Liverpool history, but it was Salah’s arrival in 2017 which kick-started the transformation under Jurgen Klopp. Rooney is Manchester United and England’s leading goalscorer. That in itself would earn him a place on this list before we consider his five Premier League titles and Champions League victory in 2008. From the moment he became the youngest player to score a Champions League hat-trick - still aged just 18  - Rooney was destined to rewrite the record books. At his best he was more than just a goalscorer, but to me he was always at his best on the shoulder of the last defender when he was capable of every type of goal. He retired with 208 Premier League goals and in time the scale of his achievements will be more fully assessed and recognised as he became one of the defining players of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Drogba was the ultimate big-game player. Whenever I came up against him, it felt like I was going to war. Mentally and physically he was as demanding as any opponent, and what makes him particularly special is how often he delivered at critical moments, securing major honours for Chelsea. His two Golden Boots contributed to four Premier League titles and he famously scored the critical equaliser and the match-winning penalty when his club lifted the Champions League against Bayern Munich in 2012. Drogba scored in all of his four FA Cup Final victories, becoming the first player to achieve that. He also scored in Chelsea’s League Cup successes, maintaining an unrivalled record in finals.  Shearer remains in the top three as much for his stint at Blackburn Rovers than his goal feats for Newcastle. The Premier League title was won in 1995 thanks to Shearer’s 34 goals in 42 games. Without him, the fairytale would not have happened. Newcastle broke the transfer record in 1996 in the hope he would have the same impact at St James’ Park, not necessarily break Jackie Milburn’s goalscoring record. Shearer’s 260 Premier League goals - including three Golden Boots - remain the benchmark for future generations. It may never be beaten. Had he won another title at Newcastle, there would be a stronger argument from me that he could be No 1. But the shortage of trophies compared to my top two means the goal count is not the only factor. Aguero scored the most iconic Premier League goal ever. Given the context, the events leading to that famous shout of ‘Agueroooooo’ in 2012 can never be eclipsed, not only because it enabled Manchester City to pip their neighbours to the title, but because it helped change the shape of the Premier League forever. The 94th-minute winner against QPR was Aguero’s 30th of the season in 2012. He matched or beat that on a further four occasions, while collecting four league titles and is sure to add a fifth in his farewell season. Aguero was a goal machine at a club where he led the transition from being serial underachievers to serial winners. There is only one winner in this list. It amazes me that anyone would ever debate it. It is not even close. Henry is not only the greatest Premier League striker, he is the greatest Premier League player. At his peak, he was unstoppable. He won the Golden Boot four times while winning two Premier League titles at Arsenal. In the year of ‘The Invincibles’, he scored 39 in 51 appearances. Between 2001 and 2006, he scored at least 30 goals in every campaign, and no player has delivered so spectacularly, so often. Henry has more goals per game than anyone else on this list, and he also shares the record number of assists in a season. That shows he was the complete striker, changing modern perceptions of what is expected of a typical No 9.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/02/jamie-carragher-top-10-greatest-premier-league-strikers/
81,"Married women to receive £23,000 state pension windfall","More than 74,000 married women are to receive a windfall of up to £23,000 after years of being short-changed by the Government on their state pension.  In total, 200,000 women who were underpaid the state pension for years are due refunds totalling £2.9bn. Large numbers of elderly, widowed and   have been forced to get by on a reduced stipend for years due to a Government oversight.  New figures released by the Office for Budget Responsibility have shown the average arrears payment for the first time. Widowed retirees are owed an average £17,000, this rises to £23,000 for married women. Meanwhile, 72,000 over 80s have been underpaid more than half a billion pounds and are to receive an average payment of more than £10,000 over the next five years. The Government is due to hand over £570m every year until 2026 to cover for the loss of income.  The underpayment of over 80s is “inexcusable incompetence”, former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb has said. From the age of 80, everyone is entitled to the state pension regardless of their National Insurance contributions. Retirees receive the “over 80” state pension if they either were not eligible beforehand or if they were paid less than £80.45 per week on the basic state pension. Slamming the Department of Work and Pensions for the “appalling” error, Sir Steve, who is now partner at consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock, said there should not have been any difficulty in paying a standard rate of pension to anyone aged 80 or more. He added: “Getting complex calculations about pensions wrong for tens of thousands of widows and married women is bad enough. To fail to do even that basic task amounts to incompetence.” Baroness Ros Altmann, also a former pensions minister, called for a full investigation and report into what went wrong. She said: ""It has taken a long time, since the problem was first discovered, for the issue to be taken seriously and the DWP’s own helplines seem to have falsely assured many of the women who claimed they were being underpaid that they were actually receiving the correct amount."" It will still be a long time before all those affected are reimbursed and there is a concern that many will sadly pass away without enjoying the extra money, Baroness Altmann added. In November, the DWP severely underestimated the total cost it would have to pay for the mistake, forecasting a cost of £100m. It has   that it will have to compensate pensioners for close to £3bn. It will be a major embarrassment for the DWP, which identified the oversight in 2020.  Steven Cameron, of Aegon, a pension provider, said it is crucial that people are confident they will receive what they are due as the system is ""incredibly complex"". He said: ""What’s now critical is that underpayments are assessed and paid as quickly as possible, to these women, many of whom are in the later years of their lives and may be continuing to struggle financially."" Hundreds of thousands of women have been underpaid as many had missed out on a one-off increase in payments as the process of claiming an additional amount of state pension based on a husband’s records was only made automatic in 2008. Prior to this date women had to apply for the uplift. Some women who have already enquired if they were owed anything were shocked to receive astonishing six-figure sums. The systemic underpayments date back in some cases to the 1990s.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/married-women-receive-23000-state-pension-windfall/
82,"Families go all out for Easter celebration, with trees, baubles, sparkling wine - and gonks...","Having missed out on Christmas with loved ones, families are really pushing the boat out to bring a festive feel to their homes this Easter. Sales of 'Easter trees', baubles, wreaths and even wine have risen considerably this year, alongside novelty Easter gnome figures - known as a gonks. The Nordic mythological creatures have gradually appeared in our homes dressed as Santa Claus, with a long white beard and red knitted hat and coat. But this year John Lewis has added an Easter equivalent. The £12 figure has the appearance of the popular festive 'Elf on a Shelf', but instead has long bunny-style ears. Gonks aren't the only decorations with a Scandinavian feel. Sales of Easter trees (pictured below), known in Sweden as Påskris which translates as “Easter twigs”, are also up according to the retailer. As are the Easter themed baubles that hang from the tree itself. Jason Billings-Cray, a buyer at John Lewis, said: ""We've noticed that customers are looking to Easter as the next big celebration after Christmas. “Customers are decorating their homes with Easter trees, baubles, wreaths and giving hampers this year as they would at Christmas time. “We've also seen customers investing in Easter baskets for egg hunts in the garden with family and friends as well as floral garlands to hang outside.” For many this weekend will be the first opportunity many have a family get together after the Government cancelled gatherings over Christmas due to rising coronavirus cases. Asda's sales of wine and joints of lamb are flying off the shelves, with sales up by 56 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. Searches for Easter wreaths, trees and decorations on eBay increased by 268 per cent, 196 per cent and 174 per cent respectively in the month after Boris Johnson’s announcement regarding the lifting of restrictions. John Lewis said sales of its Easter range are up by 241 per cent compared to last year, with baskets for Easter Egg hunts also proving popular and up by 157pc. Waitrose said sales of small eggs for hunts were up 75pc too, while Kantar figures showed sales of chocolate Easter eggs were up 50pc year on year. ""There are signs of people making a special, even symbolic, effort this year,"" Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, told the BBC. ""Grandparents might be showing up with additional treats after 12 months of restrictions."" Mr Billings-Cray said it might not just be children partaking in Easter egg hunts this year, with some adults turning to them as a form of long-awaited outdoor meet. He said: “As customers may not be able to see family this Easter they are looking for fun ways to utilise their outdoor spaces and see friends at the same time. “An Easter egg hunt is a great way to do just that, by including baskets and decorations it elevates the game and creates a more memorable experience for all ages.” Families are preparing to meet outside, eBay has said, with searches for garden chairs soaring by 268 per cent, paddling pools by 134 per cent and picnic blankets by 223 per cent. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, the analysts, said: “Easter was always going to be more about the home this year as we are still in lockdown, but it has coincided with the rule of six and people being able to meet in their gardens. “These factors mean it’s likely to be a bigger event than many retailers were expecting. The Easter weekend gives a good excuse to get together with family and friends. “Alcohol and barbecues have sold well for the obvious reason that we have to meet up outside.” Chris Gardner, director of home and garden at eBay has said many families were excited to make use of the rule of six after Christmas last year was “cancelled”. “We’ve noticed that the nation is looking to create an outdoor living space, with features such as firepits and outdoor bars seeing an increase in searches,” he added.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/families-go-easter-celebration-trees-baubles-sparkling-wine/
83,,"For a decade, as the UK forged its place as a global leader in science and  , the demand for digitally skilled workers has consistently outstripped supply.  In the wake of the pandemic and with the UK leaving the EU, the issue has become an existential one. As the Chancellor stresses throughout his  , we need to increase skills and diversity if the UK is to get back on the path to growth. In fact, a more diverse, skilled workforce is the only way we’ll get back on it. Failing to do so is no longer an option; not if we want our economy, businesses and innovations to survive.  Despite the shrinking of many sectors in the wake of the pandemic, technology saw exponential growth. A McKinsey report estimates digital transformation was accelerated by seven years because of  and in 2020 there was almost $15bn of venture capital investment into British tech startups. This is more than the rest of Europe combined. Deliveroo’s IPO  – the biggest London flotation for almost a decade –  may have got off to a bumpy start but the valuation put on it is testament to the growth and demand for technology over the past 12 months. As was Manchester-based The Hut Group (THG)’s $7bn IPO, which took place right at the centre of the coronavirus crisis in September.  This growth correlates directly with the job market. Data produced for the Government's Digital Economy Council showed that there are 122,446 advertised vacancies currently available for IT-related roles, 10pc more than this time last year (111,192), representing the highest online job ad count since the start of 2020. IT-related vacancies now account for 1 in 7 UK job openings. This success is, however, a double-edged sword. As the sector grows, and demand for jobs increases, the gap between the skills of our labourforce and those needed by employers grows ever more apparent.  Increasingly, this problem is taking on extra significance with overlapping inequalities in region, gender and ethnicity. There’s a brain drain to London where salaries are racing up, and tech roles are disproportionately concentrated in people with a fixed profile: white men with a computer science degree. There are 1.7m open vacancies across the UK’s digital economy; 70pc of tech executive teams are all-white; and just 14pc of software engineering applicants are female. Traditional approaches to recruitment have too much of a bottleneck and businesses are crying out for something new that doesn’t compromise on quality. As Chief People Officer at THG, I saw first-hand the effects and damage of the skills gap. There weren’t enough people with the skills to fill our roles. In instances where we found a successful candidate on paper, making sure they fit the culture was a gamble. The issue constrained growth, and impacted morale – something businesses everywhere will empathise with – and if such effects were seen so acutely within just one company, imagine the damaging impact they have on a national and international scale.  At THG, we solved the issue around digital skills, diversity and recruitment like we’d solve any commercial problem: by building something. We built a new approach to developing tech talent: prioritising potential, not credentials; investing in talent, not recruiters; creating opportunity, not barriers.  We removed the requirement for technical experience by developing two flagship internal programmes: THG Academy, a leadership accelerator training for 1000+ graduates annually; and THG Institute, a tech accelerator converting non-technical graduates into software engineers. Both took a unique approach to identifying and developing diverse talent with a hands-on education, learning directly from industry practitioners in a real business context. We paid recruits in training, and guided and mentored them through the development of both hard and soft skills.  During my time at the company, our recruitment and training programmes grew the company from 50 people to 5,000. Applicants for our tech programme were over 50pc female, with a high representation of BAME candidates. In 2018 the business hired more than 1,000 graduates in a single year across tech, digital, commercial and marketing roles. Across the board, we found that the talent we built up this way had greater loyalty, productivity and progression prospects than people recruited externally.  I’m immensely proud of the investment we made into the Greater Manchester region, our 130+ nationalities and the near 50/50 gender balance we achieved. THG represents everything the Build Back Better budget focused on: regional success; a people-first focus, championing potential over skills, and a high distribution of opportunity.  This gave, and continues to give, THG its competitive advantage. There were many moving parts that came together to help THG achieve one of the largest London listings in recent years, but people were at the heart of it.   This was only possible because of a leadership team that were willing to invest in unproven, high-potential talent. All  businesses need to be prepared to take such risks. In my new business, The Academy, we’re working with incredible graduates, employers and investors to helping companies find and train the best people, using a proven model. The difference is that companies can do so without taking on the financial and logistical risks of building recruitment programmes themselves. This way we can create opportunities in regions beyond London, cementing the UK’s status as a leader in tech with the talent to match, and building a new generation of leaders who more accurately represent society.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/02/britain-must-bridge-digital-skills-gap-face-consequences/
84,London to ride ‘blank cheque’ investment wave with rules rethink,"The City watchdog is preparing to throw open the door to the ""blank cheque"" craze sweeping US and European markets in a major shake-up of London's listing rules.  The Financial Conduct Authority said it was proposing to ease rules that act as a major barrier to special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) listing in the UK, as part of the Government's push to make the London market more competitive.  Under existing rules, Spacs – shell companies that list on a stock exchange with a promise to swoop on a takeover target – are effectively impossible to engineer in Britain due to rules that force these cash shells to suspend their shares in the event of a reverse takeover.  However, as part of new proposals which are expected to be introduced by the summer, the FCA said it will no longer require Spacs to suspend their listing when they announce an acquisition. London has missed out on the Spac boom which has swept Wall Street and Amsterdam, raising $83bn (£60bn) last year alone.  These vehicles have surged in popularity in recent months, attracting the likes of musician Jay-Z, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, former Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam and former politician Paul Ryan.  Earlier this week, British used car site Cazoo agreed to be acquired by a US Spac, valuing the company at £5bn. The move by the FCA comes after Lord Jonathan Hill recommended that the UK follow other countries by loosening rules on Spacs in a landmark review earlier this month. Charles Howarth, a corporate partner at law firm CMS, said: ""The whole point of investing in a Spac is that change, from a cash shell to a trading company, and suspension under the current listing rules just adds insult to the injury caused through lack of an ability to redeem shares or vote on the acquisition. ""Removing the suspension requirement and providing for a shareholder vote and redemption rights would make Spacs a rather more attractive prospect on the London market."" However, there are concerns that London might already have missed the Spac boom as the market has slowed in recent week amid  . An index of Spac listings has fallen by about a fifth since its February high. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the Government is determined to enhance London's reputation among investors now the UK has left the EU.  Lord Bellingham, a Tory peer and executive chairman of fintech payments group Sokin, said: ""We are very pleased to see the FCA moving fast, and with a short timescale, to look at Spacs in the UK.  ""The announcement of the FCA consultation comes on a day when we have seen Deliveroo shares fall sharply on opening which also shows the importance of the Hill report in creating the right listing environments for fintechs, as well as investors."" The consultation will be open for four weeks and the FCA aims to bring in new rules or guidance by early summer.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/london-ride-blank-cheque-investment-wave-rules-rethink/
85,End of the Zoom boom? New Zealand data shows what happens after lockdown,"Enduring endless video calls while working from home has been a common plight for many during Britain's lockdown. But according to new research, the end of the 'Zoom boom' is in sight.  In New Zealand, where employees and students have been returning to offices and schools outside of ""snap lockdowns"", daily active mobile usage on video calling app Zoom dropped 76pc in February compared to May 2020. The company, however, is still forecasting growth. In March, Zoom published projected annual revenue growth of 43pc, below the 326pc increase the previous year. Eric Yuan, Zoom's chief executive, predicted that some measure of remote working would remain the ""new normal"", saying that the company is ""well-positioned for strong growth"". Microsoft’s Teams has also seen its mobile app usage decline particularly sharply in New Zealand, according to Apptopia, with a 63pc decrease since its peak usage in April 2020.  Meanwhile, travel apps such as Google Maps have seen an 27pc increase since its lower point in May as users return to travelling outside their area.   Other tools used in the virtual workplace are here to stay, according to Apptopia data. For instance, DocuSign’s app, which lets you sign contracts and other documents digitally, has seen consistently high usage lately. The data follows a recent study that found 47pc of people who use video conferencing tools regularly suffer from 'Zoom fatigue'. Ofcom claims that more than seven in ten people are holding video meetings at least weekly.  Professor Jeremy Bailenson from Stanford University wrote: “Zoom users are seeing reflections of themselves at a frequency and duration that hasn’t been seen before in the history of media, and likely the history of people.”  Companies across the UK are introducing ""meeting amnesties"" to try and limit the risk of burn out among their remote workforce. Citigroup, for instance, has recently said it is banning Zoom meetings on Fridays after it ""became apparent we need to combat the 'Zoom fatigue' that many of us feel"".  ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/02/end-zoom-boom-new-zealand-data-shows-happens-lockdown/
86,Lloyd's of London boss dismisses calls for workplace Covid passports,"The boss of Lloyd’s of London has dismissed calls to introduce Covid passports for workplaces in a blow to ministers’ hopes of imposing new restrictions on offices.  John Neal, chief executive of the world’s largest insurance market, said proposals that would make office workers   were “unnecessary”.  He said by the time workers return to offices, including Lloyd’s underwriting room, which has capacity for 7,000 people, a significant proportion of the population would be vaccinated and “we'll probably be very close to herd immunity - we think [Covid certificates] are unnecessary”.  It comes as the Government weighs up plans to let employers require proof of vaccination, antibodies, or a recent negative test in a bid to get staff back into offices after more than a year of home working.  Business groups were this week finalising submissions to the Cabinet Office on the topic for a review led by Michael Gove. It is thought industry groups are broadly in favour of the idea, if measures are voluntary and time limited.  Mr Neal also said he expected footfall at the insurance market to return to ""near normal"" levels by September/October, but added that Lloyd’s anticipates underwriters and brokers will return in person as few as three days per week post-pandemic.  ""We’ve done a lot of research with the members of our market – 300 broking firms and 100 insurance firms – and they’re telling us they expect a physical return to work of three-plus days per week. So flexibility yes, but quite a significant physical presence still,"" he said.  The intervention came as Lloyd's said payouts for Covid disruption are set to hit a record £6.2bn for 2020 as it sunk to a £900m annual loss. The group's pre-tax loss compares with profits of £2.5bn for 2019. The pandemic marked its most costly single event on record and sent it tumbling to its worst underwriting result for three years. Lloyd's said that, excluding Covid-19 losses, the 335-year-old market would have posted an underwriting profit of £800m. It added that of the £6.2bn expected in gross payouts linked to the pandemic, £2.6bn was re-insured, limiting the hit. The syndicates that make up the Lloyd's insurance market have been left reeling by the pandemic, and have been forced to pay out on event cancellation, travel, trade credit and business interruption policies due to the virus. Lloyd’s said its combined ratio, a key performance metric for insurance firms, came in at 110.3pc, its worst result since 2017. A combined ratio of more than 100pc suggests that losses and costs exceeded earned premiums, implying that an insurance company has lost money on its operations. Insurers, including many linked to the Lloyd's market, were dealt a blow when the Supreme Court ruled  , though many are still said to be dragging their heels. Mr Neal said: ""We’ve not come out of it very well. At any point where your discussions with your customers results in court action is not ideal. That’s not what any of us want to see… there’s lessons to be learned.""",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/lloyds-london-hit-62bn-covid-bill/

Returning 250pc since launch and with one of the City’s most experienced fund managers at its helm, the fund kept its place in the Telegraph 25 list of our favourite funds after a spring update this year. Mr Buxton tells Telegraph Money how he invests and why it has never been such a good time to own British shares. This is a concentrated portfolio of around 35 British companies, mainly large ones that most people have heard of, but there are also some mid-sized firms as well. I don’t buy small companies. This is a fund for people that want to own the best British companies trading at reasonable prices. I look for companies that are leaders in their fields and have excellent management teams that can steer them through difficult times, such as political or technological upheaval. I would never invest in a company where I have not met the management. Even a really good team can make mistakes, so I make sure I see management regularly to keep tabs on them. I do not mind paying high prices for excellent firms, such as those with a technology edge and are growing fast, but I avoid defensive consumer groups, such as Diageo and Unilever. Valuations are too high relative to how fast they are growing. Shares are and so is the pound – just look at how many companies are being taken over by international firms. We could be on the brink of a boom for British companies. There is going to be a huge rebound starting this summer and into next year as the economy reopens and people start spending. Corporate investment will pick up and Brexit uncertainty will finally fade. This is more than a bounce back and is actually the start of something bigger and more long term. The economy will do better than people expect and the stock market will boom. In the last decade everyone has been selling British shares and buying American ones.

Another firm I own is Whitbread, the owner of Premier Inn. It has taken advantage of the downturn to raise money and capture market share off weaker rivals. In Germany, where it is expanding, it bought 22 hotels at rock bottom prices off a struggling competitor. A great thing about a downturn is that the weak get weaker and the strong get stronger. I made 10 times my money, which is very rare when you invest in large companies, buying Reuters shares in the early 1990s recession. It recovered and ultimately was bought by Thomson. My disaster was investing in an investment fund run by one of the Rothschilds. It bought Indonesian coal companies and I lost 90pc of my money. This is an example of a Spac, a shell company that buys other firms and floats their shares. They emerge when the going is good but often end up overpaying. I only invest in my own fund.

88,,"  Dear KF, My postbag and inbox are sadly filled with cases like yours and it should not be this way. More must be done to protect all bank customers and particularly those who are vulnerable whether it is due to age, health, nervousness about technology or personal situation. Even confident people who are on high alert to the fact that scammers are constantly in their midst can be caught unawares, so cunning and sweet talking are the crooks. More resources must be thrown at not only catching and convicting the criminals behind the swindles but at hindering the apparent ease they face when setting up bank accounts and abusing the phone and internet services to ply their trade. Without a dramatic shift people will lose confidence in the country’s banking arrangements. I feel angry and upset at reading all the cases I receive and particularly when I see that banks so often wash their hands of individuals because they have unwittingly followed the fraudster’s all too convincing instructions. In your mother’s case I felt there was more that could have been done by Barclays to protect her from being hoodwinked. As well as that I was dismayed by the poor service she received in trying to get her fraud complaint heard and resolved in a timely manner. I asked Barclays to look again at your mother’s experience to see if it would refund the remainder of her losses. A few days later, after investigating events, it came back and offered an extra £20,000, bringing the total refund to £37,500. This means she will have got back half of the total sum lost. In recognition of the lengthy wait she had in getting the case resolved, the bank added £250. I was disappointed not to be the bearer of better news for your mother but pleased that the bank saw fit to offer more than it did at the outset. Although scarred by the whole experience your mother was delighted by the offer. She told me: “Your actions have given me back my self respect and made my bank balance feel better.” A spokesman for Barclays said: “This was a tragic case of theft by criminals posing as genuine employees of the National Crime Agency; and we have every sympathy with our customer who was tricked into transferring funds. After careful consideration into the circumstances of this case, we have increased the funds to be returned and resolved this claim on a shared blame basis. We will support the police with any further inquiries, in order to bring these criminals to justice.” Please, please, please dear readers, never act on any unexpected call, text or email where someone says they are from a trusted organisation like the police, National Crime Agency, bank, government division such as HM Revenue and Customs or DVLA, utility company or Royal Mail, and asks for payments or bank details or panics you into transferring funds out of your account “for safety’s sake”. No genuine organisation will ever call or text out of the blue to ask you to do this or use tricks such as suggesting you make a payment via the “friends and family” option on your online banking.

89,,"This tax year HM Treasury will collect more from council tax than from capital gains tax, inheritance tax, fuel duty and alcohol duty combined. Despite this being a substantial outgoing, many of us do not know how the tax is worked out or how to reduce it. Last month it was revealed tax on  , well above inflation. Rates vary widely across the country and it is worth checking how you will be affected by using the calculator in his article. I will concentrate on England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have different rules. There are essentially three ways in which you may be able to reduce your bills; If you have a holiday let which meets the qualifying conditions you will be entitled to claim business rates apply rather than council tax. This can include the small business rates relief exemption  . In my view the recent Government announcement on holiday lets is not so much a clampdown as enforcement of the existing legislation. This is a column to help you find ways of saving tax, but only through a proper application of the rules. I expected the Government to go further and remove the business rates exemption for holiday lets altogether at a time when many councils are desperately short of funds. It is an accident of history we have eight council tax bands in England and nine in Wales, in each case based on property values for April 1991 in England and April 2003 in Wales. In 1991 there were insufficient resources to produce detailed valuations. Agents frequently drove slowly along the road with a colleague noting down valuations without even stopping the car. These rough and ready “second gear valuations” inevitably gave rise to anomalies, many of which have stuck to the present day. You are entitled to have your band reassessed by making an application to the council within six months of buying the property by asking the Valuation Office Agency to review the position. You can also do this if significant changes have been made to the property since it was last assessed. This is not without risk because the VOA may decide your property should be in a higher band. If you live in a street with similar properties this could trigger a revaluation for all your neighbours which would not make you popular.  The procedure to follow is set out in this link:  . Because of the risks you should do some preparation: The Government has confirmed that as the pandemic runs into the 2021-22 tax year it will continue to support local authorities. This will allow claims to be made for council tax assistance from the hardship fund. Support is for households facing extreme hardship as a consequence of the pandemic. Support is discretionary and each council can decide how to allocate the funds available.  ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/tax-hacks/tax-hacks-cut-cost-council-tax/
90,"World's microchip supply increasingly fragile, industry warns","Tensions over microchip manufacturing could see their prices rise by up to 65pc and cost companies more than $1 trillion (£720bn) if global semiconductor supply chains are broken, an industry trade body has warned. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which represents the world’s largest chipmakers, said shifting from today’s tightly-integrated production process, in which manufacturing of cutting-edge chips is highly concentrated in Asia, would mean the price of electronics and cars rising significantly. The industry has called for Western governments to introduce massive subsidies to encourage more manufacturing and reinforce an increasingly-fragile supply chain that it says can easily be disrupted by natural disasters, geopolitics or cyber attacks. US tariffs and blacklists have partially crippled advanced chip production in China, while Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC has leapt ahead of US company Intel in advanced production, leading to fears of   off the coast of mainland China. The concerns have come as the world faces a shortage of microchips that has seen many car manufacturing plants sit idle. This year alone, a drought in Taiwan, a fire at a factory run by Japan’s Renesas, and power cuts in Texas have disrupted supply. On Thursday, a   and published by the SIA warned that fully self-sufficient supply chains in the US, Europe, China and east Asia would “reverse the decades-long trend of making increasingly powerful and more affordable electronic devices accessible for consumers around the world”. It said that chip prices would rise by between 35pc and 65pc, require an extra $900bn-$1.2bn in upfront costs, and up to $125bn more annually, although this was a worse-case scenario in which supply chains were fully independent. Europe would bear a disproportionate amount of the cost, due to a lack of existing manufacturing capacity. The report warned that production was becoming increasingly concentrated, saying there were more than 50 points across the supply chain where one region has a market share above 65pc. Taiwan, for example, has 92pc of capacity for the most advanced semiconductors, with Korea the remaining 8pc. To counter this concentration, the US is seeking to put billions into US factories. Intel recently announced it planned to spend $20bn in two new chip plants in Arizona and to open new facilities in Europe. However, TSMC said this week it planned to spend $100bn over the next three years to increase its own capacity. The SIA said that while Taiwan subsidises between 25pc and 30pc of a new chip factory, the US and Europe’s incentives are between 10pc and 15pc.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/01/worlds-microchip-supply-increasingly-fragile-industry-warns/
91,ITV teams up with venture capital as it battles the streaming giants,"After enduring a brutal pandemic, Carolyn McCall will be praying that this year’s hopes for a summer of love come true. The   is betting on a sharp revival in the advertising market as Britain’s world-leading vaccine rollout takes effect - and relying on hits such as reality show   to tap into post-pandemic optimism. Advertising sales, which tumbled by £191m to £1.6bn last year, are poised to jump by up to 75pc next month as millions more jabs go in arms. But this growth may simply be masking a longer-term challenge as television fights for its future in an  . There are fears that the accelerated shift to digital during the pandemic may have forced TV advertisers into the hands of tech platforms. While some will flock back, others may never return. McCall is not taking such threats lying down. The 59-year-old former chief executive of EasyJet has unfurled a plan to help burnish ITV’s financial performance while nurturing a new generation of TV advertisers. ITV has launched ‘AdVentures Invest’, a media-for-equity fund where the broadcaster doles out TV advertising space in exchange for stakes in promising start-ups. The benefits are two-fold. If ITV backs the right company, it has the potential to make a hefty financial return that will support its own migration to streaming. Secondly, ITV can extol the virtues of the broadcasting world with a new breed of advertisers which may be   with the company’s ad platforms but overlooked the huge reach of TV. ITV plans to team up with venture capital funds to take up to 10 positions in companies over the next two years. Each offer will be worth more than £1m from a £15m pot set aside for the first 12 months. ITV has hired Niko Waesche to lead the charge, a venture capitalist who co-founded Germany’s leading media-for-equity fund German Media Pool. But can such modest media investments really compete in London’s fiercely competitive start-up scene that is flooded with venture capital and private equity funding? Even if they can, there is a risk ITV becomes lumbered with a string of companies that struggle to live up to their hype. Waesche is undaunted by the prospect. “Our programme is not to prove that TV works [...] it is about providing an option into the market that is superior to buying advertising with cash. The reason is because we have skin in the game,” he says. “That company knows we will provide our best people who have great insights into brand building and media strategy to help them be successful with a TV campaign. “We are primarily focused on the financial returns, but I think we can learn as much from the failures as we can from the successes of the companies we invest in.” In many ways, ITV is late to the party. Germany’s free-to-air broadcaster ProSieben has made a string of bets in digital companies through its media investment arm, SevenVentures. It was an early backer of Zalando, a German online fashion retailer that has grown into a tech juggernaut with a €22bn (£19bn) market value. UK media companies have also followed suit. Channel 4 Ventures - the broadcaster’s media-for-equity fund - has invested in the social media platform Pinterest and plant-based food business The Meatless Farm.  owner DMGT allows start-ups to target readers of the MailOnline or the   using such a model through its investment arm DMG Ventures. On Thursday, ITV announced its first investment when it took a £3m stake in  , a London-based digital mapping firm that has carved up the planet into 3m squares carrying three words to identify them. The platform, which has also attracted investment from Channel 4, claims to be a more efficient way of tracking locations than using a standard street address. It is an important marker for ITV, but the broadcaster may not always be able to have its own way in a start-up scene market awash with funding options. By zeroing in on consumer-focused firms, Waesche believes his company can hold its own. “We have to try and make our fund as pro-entrepreneurial as possible,” he adds. “That means we cannot be viewed as his big clunky corporate, but somebody that can make quick decisions and is used to the venture capital process. “ITV must be a highly-compatible and lean co-investor. We have spoken to the leading venture capital funds in the UK and we will expect them to be the lead in a transaction. “We are telling the VC’s ‘if you want to have a strong television partner at your side then we are there for you, but we are not going to be very difficult to deal with’. “Please invite us in and we promise to add value.” Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon says ITV’s funds will be offering an attractive proposition to budding entrepreneurs, but questions whether they can be as successful as Prosieben. Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis says ITV could get a double benefit, with “a gainful return on an exit like Pinterest for Channel 4” and advertising sales that have the potential to be “many times over the initial investment”. Waesche expects to hold each investment for up to five years before weighing a sale to another venture capital fund. By then, McCall will have hoped to have made some healthy returns to help cushion ITV’s transition to a purely digital world - starting with a bumper summer.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/itv-teams-venture-capital-battles-streaming-giants/

A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found that remote working did not cause a fall in productivity at 71pc of firms, suggesting many could make the shift permanent after the crisis ends.  Productivity actually rose at a third of companies, the CIPD said. The findings will add to growing evidence that the pandemic has permanently upended working patterns at many offices as staff enjoy more time at home without having to commute, and businesses seek to cut rental costs.  Accountant PwC became the latest business to announce a long-term change this week, unveiling plans to give employees Friday afternoons off this summer and the choice to work more from home post-pandemic.  It will also let staff pick their start and finish times, but said employees will be expected to spend 40pc to 60pc of their time in the office or at clients' premises. The homeworking revolution threatens to transform many industries and shift demand from city centres in a potential major blow to the economy. The CIPD survey found that just under two-thirds of businesses intended to embrace a ""hybrid"" working model after the pandemic by combining time at home and in the office.  Employers said the biggest benefits of home working are an end to to the commute and improved wellbeing for staff who have grater flexibility. However, businesses added that there is a risk staff could become isolated in a serious challenge for mental health. Charlotte Gascoigne, who wrote the report, said: “When combined with the benefits for staff well-being, and the potential savings to the employer in office costs, it’s perhaps not surprising that many interviewees had changed their mind about homeworking. “The pandemic has shifted perceptions even among those who were previously suspicious of homeworking.” However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane have raised concerns the economy could suffer if staff stay at home. Mr Haldane warned last October that remote working could dampen the creativity and innovation usually sparked in offices. He said: “Homeworking can starve us of many of these creative raw ingredients - the chance conversation, the new person or idea or environment. “Homeworking means serendipity is supplanted by scheduling, face-to-face by Zoom-to-Zoom.”  Chancellor Rishi Sunak also raised concerns over a permanent shift away from physical workplaces in an interview with the  last week. He said: “You can’t beat the spontaneity, the team building, the culture that you create in a firm or an organisation from people actually spending physical time together."" Mr Sunak warned that staff at firms axing their offices altogether could “vote with their feet” and move jobs. ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/home-workers-get-done-pandemic-study-finds/

The social media giant said it hopes to have both cables up and running by 2024, working with Google and local telecoms providers to create a new digital bridge between Singapore, Indonesia and the United States. Tech companies are increasingly helping fund the undersea cables that connect emerging markets to their US servers. Last year, a separate connection to Hong Kong was blocked last year by the Trump administration over security concerns. Kevin Salvadori, Facebook's vice president of network investments, told Reuters the new cables would be the first direct connections between North America and parts of Indonesia, which is the company's fifth biggest market and an increasingly important source of growth. One cable, called Echo, is a partnership between Facebook, Google and the Indonesian telecoms provider XL Axiata, while the other, Bifrost, involves Telkom, another Indonesian carrier, and Keppel, a Singaporean conglomerate. Mr Salvadori said: ""Those will be the first two cables to go through a new diverse route crossing the Java Sea, and they will increase overall subsea capacity in the trans-Pacific by about 70pc."" He added that the cables would require ""a very material investment"" from Facebook. They will still require regulatory approval. Indonesia is a big market for Facebook, with an estimated 130m users and widespread internet use but very few wired broadband connections,  . The Asia-Pacific region is one of Facebook's fastest-growing sources of revenue, accelerating by 31pc in the last three months of 2020 and an average of 27pc over the past two years. As well as the new cables, Facebook said last year that it would build 1,864 miles of fibre optic broadband linking 20 Indonesian cities, as well as a series of new public Wi-Fi hotspots.

94,French economy faces €15bn hit after Macron’s lockdown U-turn,"France faces a €15bn (£12.8bn) economic hit in the wake of President Macron’s belated move to plunge the nation back into a third lockdown, experts have warned. Berenberg economist Christopher Dembik said the move to close schools for almost a month would wipe about 7pc off France’s €2.3 trillion economy, costing between €10bn and €15bn in lost growth. The restrictions come as a rampant virus threatens to overwhelm its health system despite months of resistance to a third lockdown from Macron, who insisted this week there would be  France’s finance ministry has estimated that up to 150,000 businesses will be forced to close, although the President hopes to reopen bars and restaurants outside from mid-May. Mr Dembik said: “Even with a strong rebound in activity from early May onwards, the tighter April lockdown will weigh heavily … the drop in activity will mostly affect the service sector, which partly relies on face-to-face interactions.” The latest shutdown is also likely to delay France’s recovery until the second half of the year and trigger a third successive quarter of shrinking growth, Oxford Economics economist Daniela Ordonez said.  She called the vaccine a “cold shower” for the French economy, tipping it from modest growth to a likely fall of 1pc between April and June.  “In the short-term it will have a direct impact because the schools will be closed, something which was not the case last November, and that will constrain the labour force because parents will be forced to take care of children,"" Ms Ordonez said. “It is kind of a failure of the French government in the Covid-19 fight. Infection has not been controlled, which is why we are entering this kind of lockdown, and the government has waited too much to impose restrictions to curb the infection. Hospital capacity is reaching its peak and has been for the past three or four weeks. It is more of a disappointment than a surprise.” Mr Macron,  has overseen almost 100,000 deaths as the deadlier South African and Kent variants spread through France.  He pledged to speed up a vaccination programme that has covered just 12pc of the population amid red-tape and shortages, but also caused consternation by questioning the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this year.     Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said the restrictions could also damage the important domestic tourism industry, which may now not be fully open ""until June or July"". The resilience of France’s manufacturing sector has limited the overall damage of the pandemic after figures from data firm IHS Markit showed the fastest growth for its private sector in more than two decades. Markit’s purchasing manager index, where a score over 50 signals growth, jumped from 56.1 to 59.3 in March, signalling the fastest improvement in the health of French manufacturers since September 2000. Eliot Kerr, IHS Markit economist, said that while “the pandemic is still very much alive, these results show that manufacturing conditions are on the path to recovery”.

95,Crispin Odey’s troubles shine a spotlight on City’s hedonistic past,"The financial elite were having a very good time in 1998, the year Lord Mandelson said Labour was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” as long as they pay their taxes. “It was before hedge funds were institutionalised. It was normal for everyone to behave appallingly all the time – hard drinking, hard smoking, loads of recreational drugs. This was the time Mayfair started to become cool again,” says one executive. “Mayfair was a total backwater.” But what is considered cool one decade is less so in another. The small number of women who worked in finance during those years do not look back fondly on the “good old days” of a gilded era. “Women being humiliated in this country is part of upper class culture,” says one senior businesswoman who has bad memories of that time. “These are ruthless people who are part of a ruthless system which is there to deny people their economic freedom.” One of the biggest characters from the buccaneering late 1990s and early 2000s is  , once dubbed one half of the “Posh and Becks” of the City and a regular at celebrity Mayfair members’ club 5 Hertford Street. After making £220m on the night of the Brexit vote with a bet that markets would fall, the Brexiteer turned to an Italian proverb to express his delight the following morning. “Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca” – the morning has gold in its mouth – he told the BBC. But much of that glow has since come off his fortunes.   and in the past few months he has been battling   dating back to 1998. He was   earlier this month, with district judge Nicholas Rimmer questioning why he had been charged after a decision not to prosecute him was overturned by a victim review. The woman claimed   put his hands on her breast and up her skirt before she “wrestled herself free and left”. Odey said he propositioned her after he “misread the signals” but did not grope her. New allegations have since surfaced. Last week Bloomberg News reported accusations of inappropriate behaviour from two unnamed sources, a former receptionist at his firm who claims Odey used to run his hand down her back when she was at work and a former client who alleges she was asked by Odey to be his mistress in exchange for the use of his flat during a business dinner over a decade ago. Odey’s spokesman says he denies all the allegations and will be instigating legal action against them. The claims nevertheless shine a spotlight on Britain’s hedge fund industry during an era of excess. One senior businesswoman says she feels the Mayfair set will always bat away claims of sexism and harassment simply as “a lunch gone wrong”. Odey admits that he may not have noticed the cultural changes going on around him in recent years as the male-dominated finance sector finally began to modernise. He is known throughout the Square Mile as one of the last of a City old guard fond of a long lunch. At one midweek meal with an   journalist, he paired steak and kidney pudding and mash with a “side order” of a loin of beef and two bottles of wine. “Things change, if you’re running a business for 30 years you sometimes don’t see how much the world is changing culturally. There is a bit of   in that,” he says. “There are definitely improvements we can make in our culture. [But] what we do in our private life does not affect our professional life. It’s a point of view.” Despite being acquitted, now aged 62 the financier faces having to rebuild his reputation. In the secretive hedge fund industry, reputation is everything. The amount Odey personally manages shrank to around $777m (£558m) at the end of last year, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, even changed the name of around £1.3bn worth of funds from “Odey” to “Brook” in the weeks before he was acquitted. Odey claims his business has been unaffected by the court case. “At the moment everyone wants to kill Odey but we have a resilient brand,” he argues. “I’ve had all the diversions of this court case, and all the kiss and tell stories, but we’re having a fantastic time across the board – our funds have grown by 30pc this year”. His male supporters – including one who recalls watching him get slapped in the face at an event – argue that nobody should be judged in this “intense, really sensitive climate” for things they did decades ago. “Now he seems like a figure out of time,” one said. “People flourish in different ages.” Robin Birley, the owner of 5 Hertford Street, insists his friend has never been banned from the club despite rumours that he was not seen there for some months in 2014 after being caught in a compromising position by a member of staff. “Crispin is both a personal friend and a valued member of 5 Hertford Street. “There is no truth at all in the claim that he has ever been banned from the club,” he says. Odey told the   in 2014 that the incident was a “joke spread by a friend”. Odey Asset Management’s website – which shows an all-male research team, male-only portfolio managers (of which half are also Oxford graduates) and just one woman on its management team – suggests it remains a relic of a bygone era.

96,How to reverse ageing Britain and ease pressure on its public finances,"Scotland is attempting to turn back the clock to save its economy. With an older population and a far lower fertility rate than the rest of the UK, Scotland risks becoming the country’s ageing epicentre. Mortality, fertility and migration was the three-pronged approach targeted in Holyrood’s first population strategy last week as it battles to de-age its workforce. Like much of the developed world, policymakers in Edinburgh are threatened with a fast ageing population that will slash the workforce, drain public money and spark a social care crisis. Scotland’s new strategy warned that an arsenal of weapons rather than a “silver bullet” will be needed as Covid worsens the problem. Widened access to pricey fertility treatment, incentives for families to set up in Scotland, and encouraging older people to   were among a package of measures proposed. But can such policies do enough to reverse the ageing of Britain’s population? While the extension of life expectancy has been a major medical achievement, it is causing headaches for economists. “A lot of people are really underestimating how massive the changes are in the demographic outlook for pretty much every country in the world,” says James Pomeroy, HSBC economist. “Over the course of the next decade, it will be the fastest pace of change of demographics globally that we’ve probably ever seen, and we’ll ever see, because we’re at this turning point.”  from being a tailwind for many economies to a major headwind as populations age. Developed economies will see their working age population shrink, but their older cohorts expand rapidly as the large baby boomer generation retires and lives for longer. The huge increases in life expectancy is a key driver of ageing populations, but economic forces are also at play. “The point about low wage jobs, low productivity [and] jobs with low social status is that it means often that people struggle to start families,” explains prof Adrian Pabst, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). “Families either get delayed or never happen at all because they simply cannot afford it… wages are a huge area of concern here.” An ageing population means slower GDP growth, but higher public spending and a smaller tax base. Population is an important driver of economic activity with gains creating a larger workforce and consumer demand. “Scotland’s business base, the domestic customers that provide them with demand, and the workforce required to supply that demand are all derived from its resident population,” the population strategy explained. The Scottish government expects to suffer “significantly lower” increases in GDP than the rest of the UK because of its weaker population growth, while Japan’s shrinking working force   as labour shortages bite. A declining workforce means a smaller tax base that will struggle to raise enough revenue to pay for  . A worker aged 45 in the UK on average provides the most tax revenue to the state and takes out very little in public spending. That switches when that worker becomes elderly as their pension, social care and health costs sap money from the state. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that age-related spending is set to climb from 23pc of GDP in 2025 to 26.2pc in 2065, a rise sharper than any of the eurozone “big four” of France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A typical UK 89-year-old in 2021-22 is estimated to cost the state more than £30,000 a year, while the 45-year-old costs just £6,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. “The British state is changing shape to respond to pressures from the ageing boomer cohort,” warns Lord Willetts, the president of the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational centre and a former Conservative minister. “What you see is an increase in NHS spend and an increase in pension spend. We become a health and pensions state and other services tend to fall away by comparison.”  is set to push the UK’s tax burden to 35pc of GDP, its highest level since the Sixties. But paying for an older population will likely mean Britons face  . “In the absence of any other change, it’s hard to see where else it could come from,” warns Pabst. He says the alternative is an insurance system that workers pay into, helping to cover care costs later on in life. Like many of the economic challenges facing policymakers, the pandemic threatens to amplify the problem. A  , with estimates suggesting that Britain’s birth rate may have fallen to record lows. HSBC believes the pandemic could mean the global population peaks a decade earlier than previously expected in the early 2050s, with huge implications for economies. The UK is still far from the full-blown population crises facing the likes of Japan. It remains middle of the pack in terms of fertility rates among developed economies, but will still endure huge population pressures. Pomeroy predicts the UK’s working age population could be declining this decade and will “certainly be shrinking in the 2030s”. If the UK’s fertility rate fell from its current level of 1.7 births per woman to around 1.2 or 1.3, levels currently seen in Spain and Italy, the population would almost halve by 2100 if there was no immigration, he estimates. “It actually could happen, these demographic risks are so underestimated,” Pomeroy warns. There are solutions that could at least cushion the economic blow, but they are unpopular, slow and long-term. Politicians have largely preferred to kick the can down the road than grasp the nettle. The easiest and quickest solution is to raise the retirement age, delaying the point that state pensions kick in and encouraging people to work for longer. More office-based employment and improving health makes extending working lives more viable, but it is fiercely unpopular. The UK’s state pension age will rise to 67 later this decade, while retirement age increases in other countries have knocked governments’ popularity. “You could just reduce the value of state pensions or not increase it so rapidly,” adds David Sturrock, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He warns the current “triple lock” that ensures pensions increase by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5pc is “unsustainable” in the long term. Boosting immigration levels to bring in young workers that start families could also ease the pressure. While many developed economies face shrinking workforces, populations in many parts of the world are still growing rapidly. “Nigeria, Egypt, Philippines [and] India - these countries have got very fast growing populations,” says Pomeroy. “Migration could be theoretically a global solution, but as we know, that isn’t necessarily practical or politically popular in various parts of the world.” The holy grail for policymakers would be reviving fertility rates, but reversing decades-long trends could prove difficult. Boosting the number of births per woman would lift the number of young workers entering the labour market and widen the tax base to ease the pressure on the public finances. Economists argue that reducing childcare costs and bolstering the financial security of younger generations are vital in lifting births. “You really need to incentivize people and make the costs lower, which is what generally happened in Scandinavia,” says Pomeroy. With Scotland’s low fertility rate of 1.4, its new strategy included several measures to shore up young families. More affordable homes, support packages for families settling in Scotland, and expanding fertility treatment to groups such as single people and couples who already have a child are proposals being drawn up to de-age the population. Scotland is taking the first step towards solving its brewing population crisis but policymakers may need to be far more ambitious to turn back the clock.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/21/reverse-ageing-britain-ease-pressure-public-finances/

But the coronavirus lockdown has left one of Britain’s best-known executives marooned in his holiday home on the Isle of Wight. “I’ve never in my entire life spent one year in one place,” he says. “[But] swapping the Jubilee line for walking the dogs on the beach is not a bad trade.” Cheshire was appointed to the board of BT a year ago and chairman of Spire Healthcare earlier this month. Getting up to speed with new jobs over Zoom or Microsoft Teams calls has not been without its challenges. “I’ve just learned to allow an extra 10 minutes to swear at the screen,” he says. It is not the only thing he has learnt. A lifelong Bruce Springsteen and Rolling Stones fan, Cheshire has recently found himself enjoying the Taylor Swift tunes played by his children. The former boss of Kingfisher and Debenhams is now angling for what would arguably be his biggest job yet: chairman of the BT board. The unexpected resignation of Jan du Plessis earlier this month, which came amid   with chief executive Philip Jansen, has left a tantilising opportunity. “It’s not a state secret that I will put my hand up,” he says. “If there’s an opportunity for me to do it, brilliant.” Despite being favourite within the City for the job, Cheshire is not counting his chickens. “As many of my more charitable friends have pointed out, the last four chairmen have all come from outside. So my chances are not necessarily that great, but I think it’s always good to have an internal option.” He is certainly talking like a leader, however. BT is at an “extraordinary inflection point”, Cheshire says. Regulator Ofcom is allowing the FTSE 100 company   to fund the rollout of full fibre broadband, the recent auction for 5G spectrum was , and he is hopeful that its gigantic retirement fund – which has so often weighed on BT’s valuation – is in a better position. “Suddenly a lot of the headwinds that BT has had are getting resolved,” he adds. Last summer Cheshire handed over the reins as the Government’s lead non-executive director to Lord Nash after five years in the job. Prior to that he spent four years advising the Department for Work and Pensions. He remains one of the Government’s “go-to” figures to lead high profile initiatives. In December he was asked to chair the £600m Sports Winter Survival Package to protect major spectator sports, for instance. As someone who has been privy to Whitehall decision-making for so long, he is well-placed to assess how Boris Johnson’s administration dealt with the health crisis. “[A] pandemic was always on the risk registers of all the departments, including the Cabinet Office,” he says. “I think what was misunderstood was the nature of the pandemic. It was a case of preparing for the flu when it was actually [more similar to] SARS. “There’s always the danger that you fight the last war, or you fight the wrong war. And I think this didn’t become clear early enough. So we prepped, and there was lots of war-gaming, [but] it just wasn’t necessarily for the right thing.” Cheshire also highlights the Government’s well-documented reticence to introduce restrictions at the beginning of the crisis. Ministers will “have to lock down much more aggressively” if and when a future pandemic hits Britain. Speaking in front of his great grandparents’ Welsh dresser, Cheshire steps out for a moment to deal with questions from workmen that are redecorating his office. His wife Kate is out, volunteering by driving people to get their Covid vaccination. He has no complaints on Johnson’s immunisation rollout. The vaccination programme has been “spectacular”, he says. “What was just striking was the willingness to commit early to invest.” Given his background in the retail sector, Cheshire is dismayed at the damage Covid has done to Britain’s high streets. Some of the country’s best-known names have gone to the wall during the pandemic, not least  , the department store he chaired for three years before being ousted by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley in 2019. He has long been a critic of the high rents retailers have had to pay and believes the worst is yet to come for commercial landlords. “I started shutting bricks and mortar stores when I arrived at B&Q in 2005,” he says. “I was confronted with these 35-year leases. I was left thinking: ‘how the hell do you get out of a 35-year lease?’ ... If I had a store that wasn’t making money, I couldn’t get out of it.” Cheshire continues: “If on the other hand, the lease was ending, I could close it.” Landlords would then re-let the space for significantly less than B&Q was paying, he argues. “I could never get my head around this disconnect where the property market does start to react, but it’s on the bits that become vacant. “The UK is quite unique to have these long leases – in France they are much shorter, in the US they are much shorter – and that creates this overhang in the market and [landlords] won’t admit that the property is worth less. Everyone is sort of in this ‘delay and pray’ type territory.” Debenhams could have been saved before the pandemic, Cheshire says. But that required landlords to accept that just 50 of its 170 stores were profitable enough to stay open. “We couldn’t persuade the landlords to do the real change that was needed,” he says. The standoff and being locked into multi-year bank loans, left Debenhams “in a sort of zombie loop”. Having stepped down as Barclays UK chairman in January, Cheshire has been able to dedicate more of his time to promoting sustainable farming and food production – a passion that he has had ever since returning to the Borneo rainforest on holiday as a teenager. Cheshire was knighted in 2014 for services to business, sustainability and the environment. And he now wants the prime minister to set up a dedicated bank to support “agroecology”, which advocates the use of green technologies, eliminating the need for synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. It also promotes increasing the amount of land dedicated for ponds, hedges and meadows. Cheshire insists he is not campaigning for a taxpayer handout. “There are limits to what the private sector can do to help kickstart change,” he says. “It is very difficult to go green if you are in the red.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/sir-ian-cheshire-ex-barclays-boss-eyeing-bts-chairman-role/
98,UK’s OneWeb battles Elon Musk in broadband space race,"On opposite sides of the Earth and just hours apart, rockets from satellite companies OneWeb and SpaceX blasted off this week, each delivering a payload of dozens of small satellites into low orbit. British-owned OneWeb,  , fired 36 satellites into space on the nose of a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. Around 6,670 miles away, Elon Musk’s SpaceX shot 60   into the sky from Cape Canaveral on the Florida coast. Musk’s Falcon 9 reusable launchers landed at sea aboard the robotic Of Course I Still Love You ship in the Atlantic. The launches are the latest stage in an accelerating space race between the two companies. Both firms want to blanket the Earth with satellites  . Despite OneWeb securing £400m in government investment, observers have noted SpaceX appears to have gained an early lead. Since January, users in the UK have been able to sign up to a beta trial of SpaceX’s service, installing a satellite dish that links up to one of its satellites circling about 690 miles above the Earth’s surface. Some have reported speeds in excess of 150 megabits per second. For that, they pay £89 per month. By selling these dishes directly to consumers, SpaceX hopes to bypass telcos and shake-up the market. But Neil Masterson, the new chief executive of OneWeb, doesn’t appear fazed. “We are not fighting the industry, but working with them.” OneWeb is hoping to sell to telecoms companies such as BT to reach remote rural locations. Founded in 2012, the company was a pioneer in the design and construction of mega-constellations of hundreds of satellites that could provide global broadband. It raised $3.4bn from the likes of Japan’s SoftBank, but it came unstuck last March when investors pulled the plug on new funding. An unexpected white knight came in the form of the British Government,  , which secured a $1bn deal to buy the remains of the company last year. But by the time OneWeb restarted launches in December, SpaceX had ramped up its own efforts. “OneWeb were the innovators in launching a big constellation,” says Marek Ziebart, a professor at University College London. “With Elon Musk, as typically happens in tech, someone else had burnt the research and development dollars doing the high-risk process of proving something can be done, and once it is done the vultures come down.” Musk’s Starlink now has more than 1,300 satellites in orbit, covering much of the northern hemisphere. In the UK, it offers its service around 50 degrees latitude north and expects to cover Britain by the end of the year. OneWeb’s Masterson says its own service, which as of Thursday morning had 146 satellites in orbit, will provide coverage from the “North Pole to Cornwall” by the end of the year. Rather than going directly to punters, OneWeb is portraying itself as an ally to telecoms companies. “One of our shareholders [Bharti] is one of the largest telcos in the world, and we have an   into every single telco around the world. It is the natural approach for us,” he says. That offer of help will be welcome in very rural areas where the cost of installing fibre is uneconomical. Network insiders believe a company like OneWeb, working on a business-to-business basis, would be useful for providing redundancy to fibre networks, in particular to critical infrastructure. However, many still see it as a niche solution. Some experts also do not believe the ultra high speeds enjoyed by early Starlink customers are sustainable.  With only a few thousand trial customers, high speeds are inevitable. “How this will work with hundreds of thousands of customers is unclear,” one telecoms expert says. Analysts say the ultimate winner in the race for a global constellation remains unclear. “OneWeb certainly lost some of its lead during Chapter 11 proceedings,” says Caleb Henry, an analyst at consultancy Quilty Analytics. “But OneWeb’s smaller constellation means it is not necessarily behind SpaceX.” OneWeb has roughly 22pc of its network complete, Quilty says, compared with about 11pc coverage by Starlink. Masterson says OneWeb is planning between eight and 10 launches this year as it seeks to regain its position against Starlink.  The UK-backed firm has also joined a pushback by satellite companies against Starlink’s vast expansion, which has seen a dash for territory in space – Starlink’s ultimate goal is to have 12,000 satellites over Earth.  In a recent filing to the US communications regulator, OneWeb argued SpaceX’s constellation would cause “harmful interference” and claimed its satellites had a “troubling failure rate” and were “plagued” with safety issues. SpaceX declined to comment. But OneWeb has its own critics. This week, MPs including Darren Jones, the chairman of the business committee, quizzed Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the transparency of the deal, and whether he had been personally involved in brokering it. Mr Johnson said: “I don’t think I could comment on exactly who did what.” At the time of the investment, which was championed by Dominic Cummings, a senior civil servant and the UK’s Space Agency questioned whether it represented value for money for the British taxpayer. OneWeb has another potential way to gain an advantage over Starlink. It could be used as a kind of redundancy system to GPS, which is made up of 24 satellites 12,000 miles up. OneWeb’s system could be used as a position, navigation and timing [PNT] system to prevent jamming or to step in if GPS went down, an issue that is feared would cost the UK £1bn per day. “This capability is not a target of SpaceX, and represents both a strategic and financial opportunity that could be sizeable,” Henry says. OneWeb is hoping to have its system fully operational by the middle of next year. It still has to raise about another $1bn to achieve this. It plans to scale up its business to around 480 people this year, almost the same number it had pre-bankruptcy, with 70pc in the UK.  In the race against a man as ambitious as Musk, there is no doubt it needs to make up for lost time.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/27/uks-oneweb-battles-elon-musk-broadband-space-race/
99,Sunak cuts tax on Scottish flights to bolster the Union,"Rishi Sunak has announced plans to cut taxes for flights to Scotland to boost the “social cohesion of the Union”. A reduction in domestic   will be paid for by an increase in the tax imposed on long-haul flights - prompting criticism from the owner of British Airways.  Plans being considered include only charging air passenger duty one-way for domestic flights - previously outlawed when the UK was still in the EU - or introducing a lower band for domestic flights. “Domestic connectivity is a central pillar of the Government’s commitment to supporting the Union and  ,” a consultation published by the Treasury stated. “Domestic connectivity is vital in fostering integration between all parts of the UK and increasing the social cohesion of the Union. Travel by road or rail is not always practical for certain journeys within the UK, and it is important our domestic air network enables those who live in the UK to connect to areas that are otherwise hard to reach.” Aviation levies have been split into two bands: flights to destinations up to 2,000 miles away, and flights travelling more than that distance.  An economy flight from London and Edinburgh with easyJet costs less than £50, for instance. Of this, £13 - more than a quarter of the overall price - is air passenger duty.  Jonathan Hinkles, boss of regional airline Loganair, said: ""We are heartened to see the consultation around the promised changes to air passenger duty, which cannot come a moment too soon for domestic air travel.   ""The ability to make the change is one of very few benefits for the aviation industry from Brexit and it will help to address the significant loss of connectivity throughout all parts of the UK caused by APD."" While the move will be welcomed by some short-haul carriers, it will come as a blow to airlines such as BA that make bigger profits running long-haul services. A spokesman for BA owner IAG said: ""We have always said that APD should be abolished. Given the acute pressure on business, the hike in international APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This is a tax on Global Britain. We will be submitting our views in due course."" Long-haul travel has been hardest hit by the pandemic, with experts predicting that it will be the slowest to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  The Treasury is consulting on proposals to increase the amount of air passenger duty on long-haul flights by doubling the number of bands to four and introducing a frequent flyer levy.  Charging long-haul passengers more were part of what ministers called the “polluter pays principle”.  The consultation read: “Those who travel furthest internationally, and consequently have the greatest impact on the environment, [should] incur the most APD.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/23/sunak-cuts-tax-scottish-flights-bolster-union/
100,,"We are currently seeing some of the best rugby played for some time, and have come to the end of a nine-week Gallagher Premiership period following one of the best Six Nations to watch since we had 'Super Saturday' back in 2015. Rugby as a spectacle at the moment is really good. It's exciting and hard to predict outcomes because you don't know who is going to win or lose sometimes, or by what margin. All we're missing is the fans, and I hope their return doesn't make players clam up. At the same time as we're getting a high level of performance, everyone is still trying to improve the game. The World Rugby Player Welfare and Laws Symposium took place this week, with one panel led by former Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt looking at how to make the game better and faster and safer. There's a referee panel trying to improve the officials' performances, a coaches panel looking at whether coaches should be given reviews, and so on. This is all happening at a time where the level of rugby has become consistently very good, and one of the key drivers behind that has been the fact that referees have decided to start refereeing the laws. And by doing that, space appears. Keeping the 10 metres at the lineout, making sure people are actually behind the back foot, not chasing when you are in front of a kick until you are put onside. All of those scenarios create space and when space is created, the tempo of the game goes up because defences start to lose. That World Rugby committee Schmidt is part of are looking at how to speed the game up, but you can do that right now with referees continuing to enforce the current laws. We have already seen large improvements. We haven't had a referee as good as Wayne Barnes or Nigel Owens in his pomp for a while in the northern hemisphere, but I think Luke Pearce is getting up there now. The common denominator between all those referees is a sense of humour, a balance between taking the job seriously, but also not taking it too seriously. Having almost a comedy element with the players and a bit of a laugh. We as spectators and commentators find that amusing and it adds to the value of the game. But, there is a trade-off. The committee is looking at how we can reduce head contact through red cards, and I completely understand trying to drop the height of the tackle. We're trying to instil that in the players and those initiatives have worked in the past with tip tackles and dangerous collisions in the air — you will slowly see progress and those things largely disappear. Players can adapt relatively quickly and over a six-month period, you will see significant changes. We're in the middle of it now with shoulder-on-shoulder and head-on-head contacts. Aside from that particular committee working away on reducing those head collisions, we need to let the game breathe. It's in a really good place. Let the referees continue to enforce the current laws and create space and tempo. If the ball is at the back of a ruck and you have five seconds, start counting down so the scrum-halves get the ball away. That will get rid of the caterpillar ruck. If guys are walking into a lineout too slowly from a penalty, give a free-kick the other way. You have 10 seconds — get to the lineout. If you are moving all the time, players will get smaller and the impacts will get lighter. I've said it for as long as I have been writing this column — the referees have all the power. And it's no coincidence that now they have started to use that power, games have become spectacularly better and defences are starting to lose out again. Yes, there are loads of penalties, but that is educational as the red cards are for high hits. We have messed around and tinkered with the laws incessantly in recent years, and made it progressively more complicated for new people to understand the sport. The law book is remarkably simple if it's adhered to. There's an offside line you must stay behind, a tackle height you must stay below. You can't collapse a ruck. You can't make contact with the head. It’s largely about fair contests on both sides of the ball. Outside of the work going in to reduce head collisions, let's make sure those other committees leave the game alone for a year or two. Just because you are invited onto a committee or become a NED doesn’t mean you have to effect change. Sometimes it's OK to sit back and say “this all looks good, let’s leave it alone”.",Sport,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/04/02/no-coincidence-rugby-has-improved-since-referees-finally-started/
101,Hiring surges but London is left behind,"More jobs are available now than at any point since the pandemic struck as companies limber up to reopen over the coming months – but the capital continues to lag the rest of country.  Online adverts are back up to 94pc of their pre-Covid level, with more vacancies now on offer in some areas and industries than there were before the first lockdown. However London, with its relatively low share of manufacturing and higher reliance on currently absent commuters, is still behind the rest of the country. Vacancies in the capital are still around 20pc below their pre-Covid level, making it firmly the weakest performer so far in this putative recovery. Nationally, factories are particularly keen to hire, with almost 60pc more positions available now than in February 2020, according to Adzuna and the Office for National Statistics. This chimes with the purchasing managers’ survey from IHS Markit, which shows activity in manufacturing grew at Surging demand from domestic and foreign customers is pushing up hiring. Retailers and hospitality firms also need to recruit before they open their doors again. “The domestic market remained the prime source of new orders, as companies reported that the vaccine rollout and clients’ preparations for the loosening of lockdown restrictions underpinned the expansion,” said Rob Dobson at IHS Markit. “Many expect this process to be supportive during the year ahead as well, raising business optimism and jobs growth to their highest levels for seven years.” Hiring in healthcare is just below its pre-Covid levels, while vacancies in education are around 10pc below. Wholesale and retail jobs are showing some improvement, back at two-thirds of their level in February 2020 - the strongest showing since Christmas - while  at just over one-third of usual hiring. This marks the strongest number of vacancies since early Autumn, before the November lockdown forced more bars and restaurants to close their doors again. By region, there are more positions now on offer in swathes of the country than there were pre-pandemic, including in Northern Ireland, the North West, North East and South West of England, as well as the Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber. Businesses expect the situation to improve as the economy reopens, according to the Bank of England’s survey of private sector leaders. It reported fading fears that employment will fall over the next year. It also found companies predicting that investment, which has been depressed by Covid, could end up being higher next year than would have been the case without the pandemic, indicating some rebound could take place. Hospitality businesses have suffered the most under lockdown but look set to embark on the biggest investment push next year.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/hiring-surges-london-left-behind/
102,Independence risks economic havoc for Scots,"Until the early 18th century, crossing the border between Scotland and England meant entering a lawless territory plagued by raiders, livestock rustlers and an assortment of other ne’er do wells – who, in the phrasing of William Wordsworth, would “prey alike on two distracted countries”. Small forts, walled homesteads and pele towers still litter the landscape with reminders of that blood-soaked age. Thankfully, after more than three hundred years of political union, things are a lot simpler: travellers are more likely to be greeted by a Saltire sign reading   (welcome to Scotland) – or, coming the other way, the signs of the Northumberland or Cumbria county councils – than a freebooter. But political strife threatens to return. May’s elections could trigger a major push for a  , just seven years after “once in a generation” plebiscite. The SNP is polling around 50pc and is expected to demand a new vote if it wins a  . Yet much has changed since last time. Economically and financially there have been three main shifts: Brexit, a Covid-enforced boom in debt and a global plunge in oil prices. All make the prospect of independence significantly more challenging. The SNP’s long-standing policy, championed by Nicola Surgeon, is for an independent Scotland to  . But analysis suggests taking such a step too quickly could have devastating consequences. Scotland’s economy is hugely open, with imports and exports each equivalent to around 60pc of its GDP. The country trades about three to four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU. “The received wisdom sometimes in Scotland seems to be that because Brexit is bad, 'Scexit' and reversing leaving the EU would be good economically,” says David Phillips, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “I am not sure that is true, certainly in the short to medium-term. “With a reasonably hard version of Brexit there is almost a choice – do you be part of the UK single market or the EU’s single market?” Trade modellers from the London Schools of Economics say seccession would eventually slash income per capita in Scotland by as much as 8.7pc, dwarfing Brexit’s anticipated long-term hit of 2pc. Rejoining the EU would “do little to mitigate the costs of Scottish independence”, according to these experts, shaving the fall only slightly to between 6.3pc and 7.6pc – and only in the long run. In the short term, they say that returning to the EU would be   than remaining in a common market with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The modellers point to a paradox in the economic argument for leaving the UK and joining European bloc. “For an independent Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence must destroy a sufficiently large share of Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK that the EU becomes Scotland’s most important trade partner,” they say. “For rejoining the EU to be economically desirable, independence itself must bring substantial economic costs.” Hanwei Huang, one of the report’s authors, says disentangling the Scottish economy would likely prove more complicated than Brexit. “It probably would depend on the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” he says. “For example, if the UK and EU has a closer relationship, probably it is more attractive for them to stay in the UK common market.” The dangers of an immediate re-entrance to the EU show how much the economic case for Scottish independence has weakened since 2014 – even before factors such as the recovery from Covid-19 are taken into account. Covid has given Britain its  . The national debt has surged by more than a third, from just under £1.5 trillion in 2014 to more than £2.1 trillion now. Working out how to split this bill, built up over centuries, will be politically fraught - and economically critical for a newly independent nation trying to win the confidence of international markets. In 2014 the Scottish Government suggested splitting it by “historic contribution” to the finances, arguing that since 1980 oil revenues meant Scotland has chipped in more than the rest of the country. This would result in Caledonia taking around 5pc of the national debt. Westminster argued this was spurious as extra spending also goes north. In addition, the sums change radically depending on the base year - counting only from 1990 to 2014 and Scotland’s share doubles to almost 10pc. That translates to either £105bn or £210bn. An alternative is to split the debt by share of the population. This would give an independent Scotland just over 8pc of the UK’s national debt, or around £170bn. Either way, investors who bought UK bonds will not see some morph into Scottish bonds. Instead, Scotland would pay the interest on the agreed share of the debt then potentially take some on as the bonds mature, depending on the deal. Meanwhile,  . In 2014 prices seemed permanently high, with fevered talk of Brent reaching $200 per barrel: ideal conditions to finance Scottish spending for years to come. But prices tumbled, dragging tax revenues from the North Sea to a small fraction of their old level. Investment has plunged, output is set to fall steadily and 2050 net zero emissions targets mean the energy source is out of favour altogether. A 2018 report from the Sustainable Growth Commission, established by the SNP, acknowledged the shift and suggested an independent Scotland should treat future oil and gas revenues as “windfalls” rather than a reliable basis for day to day budget planning. As things stand now, that day to day budget would be seriously in the red. Before the pandemic, Scottish tax revenues per capita were a touch lower than those in the UK as a whole, while spending was higher. Mairi Spowage at the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute notes that this extra spend – some of it set by Westminster, but some, particularly on education and healthcare, decided in Holyrood – means Scotland typically runs a notional budget deficit around six percentage points bigger than the UK’s. In 2019-20 this came in at 8.6pc versus the UK’s 2.6pc. “They tell us little about the long-term sustainability of the public finances of an independent Scotland, because presumably there would be different choices made, different priorities and perhaps things that they would choose not to spend money on as well,” she says. As the Scottish Government puts it: “The whole point of independence is to give the Scottish Parliament all the economic levers it needs to grow our economy and to make the public spending choices best suited to Scotland’s interests – such as not spending hundreds of billions of pounds on the  .” Yet even trimming defence and UK-wide project spending would only cover around one-tenth of the deficit, according to Phillips. Financial markets might be willing to lend big sums at small interest rates through Covid, but they are unlikely to fund large deficits year in, year out. “At the moment, in effect, Scotland is able to slightly live beyond its means because of the fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK,” says Phillips. “Scotland could be a successful independent country, but it would have to fund its own public spending, rather than have some of it implicitly funded by transfers from the rest of the UK. “That would require some combination of tax rises, austerity and borrowing in the first decade at least of an independent Scotland.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/independence-risks-economic-havoc-scots/
103,,"Why all the fuss about  , now again the subject of fierce debate north of the border as we approach May’s Holyrood elections? Is not Scotland already essentially an independent nation; to finally cut the Gordian knot is only to formally recognise a pre-existing disposition. It might also save the rest of the UK a great deal of money. That’s too flippant a way of looking at things, no doubt, but the Scottish government certainly behaves as if it is running an entirely independent country, an impression further underpinned by the pandemic, where Scotland maintains a largely independent containment policy. Call it devolution if you like, but from the outside, it looks like much more. Across multiple fronts, public policy is now so completely divergent from the rest of the UK that Scotland might as well be fully sovereign. So divergent, in fact, that you begin to wonder whether it is not the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rather than Boris Johnson, who these days calls the shots for the union as a whole. Her offer of a  , snuck out on the very eve of pre-election purdah - a vote buying initiative if ever there was one - has had the real Prime Minister down in Westminster scurrying off shamefacedly to reconsider his stingy  . How is it, you may well ask,  , but unaffordable down south, which to the extent that anywhere in the UK these days generates a fiscal surplus is where it tends to occur? It’s called the Barnett formula, after the former Labour chief secretary to the Treasury, Joe Barnett, and it works like this. Every year, the budget of the devolved administrations is set by taking the previous year’s spending and adding a pro rata share of whatever increase there has been for the UK as a whole. Last financial year, the Barnett block grant to Scotland amounted to £32bn. The effect is that historic differences in spending are preserved in aspic regardless of whether any longer justified. A further distortion arises because Scotland’s population has been shrinking relative to England’s, which boosts nominal spending per head over time - such that it is today more than 20pc higher than England. As it is, the only parts of the UK that in normal times generate a fiscal surplus - in the sense that they raise more in tax than they spend - are London, the South East and East England. Everywhere else spends more than they raise in tax. For Scotland, the shortfall in 2019 was £2,482 per head. Actually, this is not particularly high by the standards of some UK regions. For instance, the North East spends £4,064 per head more than it raises in tax, according to the latest ONS data. But here’s the point. Scotland is by no means a poor part of the UK; actually, average earnings are roughly the same as the UK as a whole. It follows that Scotland’s per capita contribution to tax revenues is also roughly the same. Scotland’s slightly higher top rates of income tax make only a marginal difference. Revenues from North Sea oil have also ceased to offer much by way of the offset once claimed for them by Scottish separatists. In any case, if you want to know why Scotland can “afford” free higher education, free social care, free prescriptions, a 4pc pay rise for healthcare workers, and all the rest, but England can’t, ask the late Joe Barnett. It is also why the Scottish National Party opposes anything by way of meaningful reform. They know a good thing when they see one. Despite the distortions, they will not be backing the “needs based” system sometimes proposed by way of a fairer alternative. The UK Government also guaranteed continuation of the Barnett formula when campaigning against Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. We tamper with it at the union’s peril. Indeed, the only way it could plausibly be changed is ironically via a vote for independence in the second referendum Sturgeon threatens to demand should she win an overall majority in the  . Personally, I doubt those ambitions have been as badly damaged by   over who knew what and when as imagined, even with the split in the nationalist vote threatened by Salmond’s new political party. All the same, for Boris Johnson the spat is like a gift from the gods, confirming his reputation as the luckiest of generals. Brexit seemed to doom him to the ignominy of being the Tory Prime Minister who took us out of Europe’s common market only to lose the union.  Exquisitely, the sight of the Scottish National Party tearing itself limb from limb over a matter that nobody could quite understand beyond the evident visceral hatred the participants have for one another, like clansmen fighting in a field, seems to have come to his rescue. Unwise to bet on it quite yet, though. The emotional pull of independence remains a mighty powerful one. This despite the fact that far from easing since the last referendum, the economic challenges of actually implementing a fully independent Scotland have steepened yet further, such that they today seem almost insurmountable. The question of who pays refuses to go away. Given the EU’s almost existential difficulties right now, Europe is not going to be exactly rushing to fill the vacuum in Scotland’s finances left by removal of the English teet. Some part of the shortfall could be met by cancelling Scotland’s share of UK defence spending, yet that would only further undermine the economy by rendering the country’s role as a major UK defence contractor and home to Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent obsolete. Even if Scotland is forgiven its share of Britain’s national debt - a degree of magnanimous generosity rarely seen before when countries go their separate ways (though interestingly, it is what eventually happened in the case of the Republic of Ireland) - massive tax hikes and spending cuts would be required to put Scotland’s public finances on a sustainable footing. For a country that still feels badly wronged by years of Tory austerity, that’s quite an ask. A plausible answer over what to do about the currency has also yet been proposed. Sterlingisation is no kind of a solution; just think what would have happened to Scotland with no lender of last resort to bankroll the emergency expenditure that has been required by Covid. On its own account, Holyrood would have found credit impossible to access. The fact is that the unsatisfactory nature of today’s settlement suits Sturgeon’s Scottish nationalists rather better than they care to admit, sustained in power as they are by the largesse of the Barnett formula and the unfulfilled dream of independence. The challenges of the real thing would very likely finish them off.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/27/englands-giant-subsidy-scotland-just-sturgeons-nats-like/
104,"Taxpayer-backed SNP deal which promised 2,000 jobs delivers fewer than 50","Fewer than 50 of a promised 2,000 new jobs have been created as a result of a taxpayer-backed takeover of the UK’s last aluminium smelter, a senior SNP minister has admitted. Fergus Ewing, the SNP rural economy secretary, said the 44 additional people had been hired since the Scottish Government agreed to provide a 25-year financial guarantee,  that allowed steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta to take over an industrial site in Fort William, in 2016. Then, it was claimed that the investment would create 1,000 direct jobs and a further 1,000 indirect jobs, while adding £1 billion to the local economy, within a decade. However, Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance is now facing a funding crisis,   Mr Ewing delivered a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday to address fears that Mr Gupta’s empire, which also includes the Dalzell steel plant in Motherwell, is now on the brink of collapse. Mr Ewing told MSPs that Mr Gupta had personally assured him last week of the “underlying operational health” of his Scottish assets despite acknowledging “challenges” caused by the collapse of Greensill.  Defending the Government’s   in a deal which also included nearby hydro plans used to power it and a large Lochaber estate, he said the alternative would have been to see the facility close. However, Willie Rennie, the Scottish LibDem leader, challenged Mr Ewing after he said there had been 44 new jobs at the site, taking the overall total to just 200. Mr Rennie said: “The Government told us five years ago that the multiplier and supply chain impacts in Lochaber would be worth 2,000 jobs. Are we ever going to see those jobs, and what discussions did he have with Mr Gupta about creating those jobs?” Mr Ewing replied that the jobs that had been created were “valuable” but admitted the firm’s original plans for building an alloy wheels plant “could not proceed” due to problems in the British car industry. He added: “That’s simply a fact that nobody anticipated in 2016, not Mr Rennie, not Mr me [sic], or anybody else. “However, the company have come forward with an amended plan which includes a billets plant and a [water] canning plant. There’s challenges ahead, but we are working extremely hard with everybody to achieve delivery of these objectives.” The deal the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Gupta in 2016 saw it agree to a 25-year guarantee to buy energy from the Lochaber hydro plants, should the smelter shut down, worth between £14m and £32m per year. ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/24/taxpayer-backed-snp-deal-promised-2000-jobs-delivers-fewer-50/
105,,"The pitter-patter of tiny   feet has been even harder to hear in Italy over the past 12 months after the pandemic struck a nation already bearing the sorry label of Europe’s biggest demographic disaster zone. At the end of last year, births plunged by almost 22pc across 15 Italian cities nine months on from the beginning of the lockdown. If Auguste Comte’s famous dictum that “demographics is destiny” is any guide, it spells more bad news for a country which already has the highest share of over-65s in Europe, at 22.8pc.  Italy’s total fertility rate has been   to stand at 1.3 births per woman, far below the 2.1 “replacement rate” to replenish population, absent migration. Early in the pandemic, more than a third of couples abandoned plans to procreate, and Guiseppe Conte’s administration turned to bribes in a bid to turn the demographic supertanker last June with plans for monthly payments of up to €240 (£205) for new mothers under a new Family Act. On this side of the Channel the fertility rate is higher, standing at almost 1.7 in England and Wales in 2018. But there are enough warning signs for ministers to be concerned about slipping into an Italian-style trap.  The latest comes from Southampton University’s Centre for Population Change, which weighs up a myriad of factors such as 200,000 delayed weddings, frustrated chances to socialise and economic uncertainty. It comes up with a worst case scenario of 66,000 fewer children born in 2023 if the previous   is combined with a . It estimates that the fertility rate already slipped below the previous lows of 1977 and 2001 to just 1.6 in 2020 – but could fall even closer to Italian levels by 2023 at 1.45. Idiosyncrasies have deepened the Italian problem, such as much lower female participation in the workforce, which is linked to lower fertility. In a traditionally Catholic country fewer Italian children are born outside of marriage and they live in the family home for longer. Meanwhile economic uncertainty and a lack of job opportunities prompted almost 160,000 Italians to emigrate in 2018: some 21,000 chose to come here.  But there are also similarities which should strike a worrying chord in the UK, such as a patchy and expensive childcare system and a decade-long hangover from the financial crisis which is hampering the ability of young people to “transition” into adulthood and start families. Since 2000, for example, the share of British 20-34 year olds living at home has risen from 20pc to 26pc, with almost a million more people now living with their parents. While the UK does not share Italy’s cultural ties to the family home, the story is more about affordability following a decade of virtually stagnant pay for younger cohorts now entering what is supposed to be their demographic prime.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in 2019 that the age group that had done worse since the financial crisis were those in their 30s, who emerged into the jobs market in the 20s in the immediate aftermath of the recession and are still suffering average earnings 7pc below the pre-crisis level for their age. The average age of first-time buyers in the property market has  , and research shows the rise of the private rented sector is bad news for fertility as parents are exposed to the greater uncertainty it brings such as the unsettling effect of potentially being forced to move their offspring around schools.  Other ingredients in this unappetising demographic dish include the impact of ultra-loose monetary policy since 2009 which has sent cash into assets like homes in a search for yield due to ultra low interest rates. That has pushed up prices along with the Government’s , fuelling a scarcely interrupted jamboree for housebuilders since George Osborne introduced the scheme in 2013.  The result of these myriad factors is that the very age group which we would usually expect to do the population “heavy lifting” (so to speak) has been the biggest economic victim of the past few years.  This requires some hard and radical thinking from ministers, especially as lower immigration acts as another handbrake. The previous all-time low for fertility was in 2001, on the cusp of a wave of immigration from the European Union accession countries; whatever the societal implications of the influx ahead of the Brexit vote, the arrival of younger workers was a boon for population growth.  The Migration Advisory Committee modelled what happened in 2004 against the Labour Government’s original more restrictive proposals and found the overall population would have been more than 3pc smaller with a similar drop in overall output. Following Covid, the population tailwind has partially reversed with more than 180,000   in the past year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some estimates put the UK’s population fall as high as 1.3m in the past 12 months.  Migration is likely to be permanently lower under the points system, so the Government needs to pull supply side levers. Its mortgage guarantee scheme for first time buyers risks exacerbating the affordability problem if it simply encourages demand without impetus to supply. Conservative backbench opposition to last year’s planning White Paper was depressingly predictable, but speeding up the delivery of affordable new homes is probably the best hope for prising young people away from the parental hearth and getting on to making babies. The CPC’s demographics professor Ann Berrington suggests “small cash benefits” for would-be parents are unlikely to work: the Government instead needs to look at a range of more family friendly policies and more generous subsidies for childcare, where the UK ranks among the most expensive in the world according to the OECD. Boris Johnson has looked after the old, through lockdown – and through the preservation of the pension “triple lock” – but now he needs to offer something to the young. Labour data shows young people bearing almost two-thirds of the fall in employment since the pandemic struck: the danger is the same sorry saga of the financial crisis will be played out again, and the UK will follow Italy further down a barren path.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/30/britain-must-reverse-baby-bust-toavoid-italian-decline/
106,,"Who remembers “immunity passports”? It might seem a lifetime ago, but last April the Government debated whether someone who had caught Covid-19 and recovered from it should be given a certificate to resume normal life. The idea soon died. An   would have encouraged young people to deliberately seek infection, impairing public health efforts. Demand for antibody tests would have shot up as a free hit for freedom, and with actual prevalence low, led to a high proportion of “false positives” among those deemed to have antibodies. Ultimately, the tests proved an imperfect guide to immunity anyway, sometimes only showing antibodies for a few months despite infection providing longer-lasting protection. Government-backed   will, I suspect, also end up in the policy graveyard. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has been tasked with reviewing them under the lockdown exit roadmap. But while some private businesses may require vaccination proof for patrons or inbound travellers in the near future, a government-backed scheme is completely unnecessary. The short-term hurdles to implementing it will be huge, and by the time they are overcome, the hassle will not be worth it. Unlike immunity passports, government   create a positive dynamic in theory. Even talk of their possibility provides an incentive to get vaccinated, so actually enhancing public health efforts. Who wants to be locked out from their football club, travelling abroad, or even from   after a year at home? The prospect encourages the pro-social action of getting immunised. Certainly, the British public recognise these benefits. Large majorities support a “vaccine passport” right now, not just for travel or visiting care homes, but even for hairdressers or the gym. Arguments about the creation of a “two-tier society” rightly do not wash: Covid-19 has wrought destruction by killing 127,000 people while certain occupations have had to work throughout. In the private sphere, why should people working in social industries not have the freedom to set association restrictions to protect their employees and other customers? Right now, care homes are having to navigate housing vulnerable people, some of whom cannot be vaccinated, with returning visitors who are unwilling or yet unable to be jabbed. Even working men’s clubs in some parts of the country are patronised by elderly guests, and their owners may decide they want to offer a safer environment by setting new rules on entry. Government should not preclude against such private decisions. These locally-set policies aren’t impingements on fundamental freedoms but exercises of them. Yet there’s a world of difference between businesses experimenting as things reopen and a state-backed licence or mandate on industries. The Prime Minister has said no national scheme would come into effect until everyone had been offered the chance of vaccination. Yet that is when the public health benefits of screening would be weakest. Every indication suggests that  . This will severely cut the overall transmission of the disease, as well as near-eliminating the worst risks of death or hospitalisation. We do not have flu passports, so why, once risks have fallen, would a domestic Covid-19 vaccine passport be needed? As the health threat of Covid-19 trails off, reopened hospitality industries will be reluctant to spend time and resources policing such a scheme and, in any case, the real public health threat would be from new vaccine-resistant variants that an existing vaccine passport would do little to mitigate. That raises other questions: would any UK scheme only recognise the vaccines approved by our own Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or those deemed safe abroad? If the South African variant gets a foothold in the UK, will the terms of the scheme change given certain vaccines appear much less effective against it? And how long would this “green light” associated with any vaccine last? We don’t really know yet how long they confer immunity for, after all. So would these passports need to be renewed forever? Gove has already acknowledged that a “vaccine passport” would, in reality, have to be a broader “Covid status” certification to cover all bases, with perhaps an app allowing you to include recent negative test results or any immunity from infection. But that itself raises all sorts of uncomfortable issues. Not everyone has a smartphone, for one. By the time a paper-based alternative was set up robust to potential fraud, any health benefit would again be miniscule. The strongest case for some vaccination proof is for international travel. Yet even here it’s not clear why the Government must reinvent the wheel with its own programme. The International Air Transport Association is already working on a “travel pass” to provide airlines, passengers, and governments with the assurance that the tests and vaccinations of passengers are accurate and from reputable sources. At most the Government could “certify” such efforts for inbound travellers. The idea though that we’ll all be flashing a QR health code to enter the cinema or to go to McDonald’s once everyone has had vaccine opportunities is just fanciful. And governments should be wary of contemplating a policy that has no logical end point and which would impose costs without, at that stage, any obviously large benefit. Some firms will no doubt set their own association requirements in the coming months, just as individuals will be more willing to meet with vaccinated friends. The Government too might keep up the chatter about domestic vaccine passports to further boost vaccine take up. But when you think through all these difficulties, the best bet is that any government-led domestic vaccine passport will be quietly shelved, just as immunity passports beforehand.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/vaccine-passports-destined-policy-graveyard/
107,,"Royal Mail shareholders aren’t used to special deliveries. Under former boss   it was only ever bad news that landed on the doormat.  But chairman Keith Williams has pulled it out of the bag quicker than an Amazon Prime order: a doubling of half-year profits; a   in the space of a year to 520p; and a one-off dividend of 10p-a-share in the post for long-suffering investors. The big winner is Czech billionaire Daniel Kretínský, who either through luck or spectacular foresight, began buying shares last year when they were trading at all-time lows of less than 150p. Nicknamed “The Czech Sphinx”, he will be smiling like a Cheshire cat after building a stake now worth £730m. Even Williams, a veteran of multiple corporate shake-ups, will be surprised by the dramatic turn around in the company’s fortunes. This time last year, with losses standing at £1m a day in the UK, the former BA boss was speculating whether Royal Mail would be able to make it through winter.  The only thing Back’s £1.8bn “transformation plan” succeeded in transforming was relations with the unions, and not for the better. He infuriated the Communication Workers Union, first by trying to force through changes to pay and working conditions while commuting from his luxury Swiss apartment, then refusing to jet into Britain at all when the pandemic struck. Williams has  with an inflation-busting pay deal that even the CWU, a notoriously tough nut to crack, hailed as “excellent”. It helps too that the union has turned its guns on BT with threat of a first national strike in more than three decades in a row over planned job cuts and site closures. It’s pick and shovel work but it has paved the way for Williams to implement some swift reforms including the development of a , and the rollout of new technology and automation. It’s also become apparent that the underlying opportunity for Royal Mail is huge. Amid an explosion in online shopping during the pandemic, parcel deliveries are booming at home and abroad, and a decline in letter volumes has been less precipitous than feared. As the logistics for the new economy are created, there is the potential to become an exciting high-growth company. Amazon, UPS, Hermes, or DHL scoff at the suggestion that a plodding corporate dinosaur could win the delivery wars but none are capable of building a network that encompasses every door in the country. Royal Mail’s decision to start Sunday deliveries, as well as collections for returns, is a decisive moment in the battle. There are caveats – the pandemic boom could fizzle out, further skirmishes with the CWU can’t be ruled out, and service remains unreliable – but the resurgence at Royal Mail is shaping up to be one of the most astonishing of recent times. It was only in 2019, that Vince Cable boasted that as business secretary   by landing Royal Mail's problems on shareholders rather than the taxpayer. Once again, it looks like he missed the point.

For all the hype around Monzo and Revolut, they are  . Losses have spiralled during the pandemic and in a desperate attempt to make money, the so-called digital challenger banks are being forced to branch out, offering over-priced premium accounts and other services with questionable demand. So much for the online lockdown boom. That’s not to say that PensionBee is a bad company. Founder Romi Savova is a former investment banker with an entrepreneurial flair. She’s spotted an interesting opportunity  . The company says the potential is huge: there are an estimated 20m people within its core target market, each with at least two pension pots. Yet for all the supposed promise, growth has been remarkably elusive for a business set up seven years ago. It has just 400,000 customers and £1.5bn of assets under management. And there’s little evidence of the opportunity being monetised - turnover was a meagre £6.2m in 2019, while losses almost doubled to £10.4m. Yet reports suggest that the company hopes to command a stock market valuation of between £300m and £350m, equivalent to nearly 50 times revenue, even at the bottom end. The reality is that PensionBee is little more than an online pensions provider and “tech-enabled” is not the same as being a pure technology company such as Facebook or Google. The same goes for Cazoo, currently motoring towards   - not London - apparently because UK investors don’t get tech like the Americans, claims founder Alex Chesterman.

109,Deliveroo snubbed US approach ahead of disastrous float,"Deliveroo snubbed an approach by US investors to go public just weeks before its disastrous opening day on the London Stock Exchange  .  The food delivery company was approached earlier this year by a   with a takeover offer, sources said. If bosses had taken up the offer they would have avoided one of the worst stock market debuts on record. Deliveroo's shares crashed by more than a quarter on Wednesday hitting retail shareholders who bought £50m through its app.  One banking source said: “Doing a Spac might have made sense, maybe they should have done that instead.” Spacs are blank cheque companies that list on markets with the view to taking over a promising company. Such deals are not currently popular in London due to current market rules. Critics have also warned that Spacs, which have been backed by the likes of musician Jay-Z, are inflating a risky bubble and could result in a crash. While it is not clear what kind of price Deliveroo would have attracted in a Spac, the vehicles have raised nearly $97bn (£70bn) this year. Several companies that have gone public this year using the method have achieved lofty valuations. Electric van maker Arrival was valued at $13bn in its US Spac listing, despite never having made a vehicle. A Deliveroo spokesman declined to comment. There was speculation in the City yesterday that Deliveroo founder Will Shu was prepared to lower the food delivery company's initial offering share price only for investment bankers from Goldman Sachs to insist that there was sufficient demand at the lower end of its target range. Prior to Wednesday's listing, a slew major investors said they would not invest in the float, describing Deliveroo's employment practices as a “ticking bomb” and criticising its reliance on gig-economy workers. This week, its rival Just Eat said it was expanding to hire a total of 2,000 delivery riders as workers, rather than Deliveroo's self-employed contractor model. City insiders believe the poor reception could lead other technology companies preparing to list in London to reconsider their plans, a blow to hopes from Chancellor Rishi Sunak that reforms to listing rules would lead to a new “Big Bang” for UK markets. “I think it changes things [for other listings],” the banking source added. “People remember the headlines.” In particular, the frosty reception for the dual-class shares held by Deliveroo chief executive Will Shu, which give him outsized control of the company’s voting decisions, may put others off using them. Several major institutional investors, including L&G,  .  Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, said the poor opening day performance may cause some other companies, such as Oxford Nanopore, to “think twice about where they intend to go public”. He added that Deliveroo rival Doordash was trading at a far higher multiple since its float in December “for no other reason than it is listed in the USA”, adding: “This is a major black eye for the London Stock Exchange.” Other bankers, however, said they did not expect Deliveroo's float to shut down the market for London listings, although it had given some pause for thought on how to structure their deals. Phil Adams, chief executive of investment bank GCA Altium, said: ""What this has highlighted is that investors are not going to always take everything at the highest price, which is nothing new.” Despite these concerns, the LSE reported that £15.9bn of capital was raised through listings in the first quarter of the year - a 15-year-high. Some City figures have defended Deliveroo, arguing a “wave of cynicism and criticism” had been directed at the company. Xavier Rolet, the former LSE chief executive, said London had its ""work cut out to catch up with the US”.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/01/deliveroo-snubbed-us-approach-ahead-disastrous-float/
110,,"One of the many remarkable features of the current downturn –  , as we are repeatedly told – is quite how few major corporate/financial collapses and scandals, normally part of the meat and drink of a bad recession, it has so far produced. Until now, that is. In short order we’ve had first the supply chain finance company  , and now the blow-up of a multi-billion dollar family-owned hedge fund  . Fortunately, neither of them appear at this stage to be of any obvious systemic importance, in the sense that like Long Term Capital Management in the late 1990s, they threaten a cascading series of bankruptcies across the financial system. There is as yet no sign of such a chain reaction. Indeed, but for the  , and the threat posed to the pitifully small remnants of Britain’s once mighty steel industry, Greensill would have struggled to stay in the headlines at all. Archegos may yet turn into something bigger – the widespread dumping of positions to answer margin calls is a classic trigger for wider stock market sell-offs. But again, for the moment, the fallout looks relatively contained, with the damage limited to a number of major banks, all of which thankfully appear solvent enough to weather the losses. There is, however, a common theme to these collapses. Both are the offspring of today’s zero interest rate environment, and the search for yield that it gives rise to. Given the extreme levels of fiscal and monetary support throughout the pandemic, we must assume that Greensill and Archegos are   of reckless lending and finance that has yet to fully rear its head. They may be just the canaries in the mine shaft, with much worse to come as the economy begins to recover. That’s the pattern of the sort of overreach we have seen in financial markets over the past year. All fired up with government and central bank money, they seem to be going for broke. I once had the pleasure of meeting Lex Greensill, then still struggling to make his supply chain finance startup fly. Keen to impress on me the importance of his venture, he billed the company as part of a new wave of fintechs destined to transform finance while at the same time performing the very great public service of providing better access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses. But try as he did to persuade me, I struggled to see the difference between what he was offering and traditional invoice factoring, whereby companies are able to gain early access to the funds owed to them by in effect selling the invoice to someone else. This form of finance has been available for donkey’s years; other than a lot of front, it was hard to see what Mr Greensill brought to the table. In any case, I quickly forgot about what seemed to be just another evident, albeit at that stage, harmless chancer. When a company claims to have reinvented the wheel, it is nearly always a red flag, and so it proved with Greensill. Much the same could be said of Northern Rock, which claimed a whole new funding model for the fiercely competitive and bog standard business of household mortgage lending. That model turned out to be about as safe as a lighted match in a gas works. The demeaning cliché of a wild west-style bank run soon followed, proving yet again that when it comes to the fundamentals of finance, there is nothing new under the sun. Remember Paul Volcker’s observation about financial innovation? The last genuine innovation to come from finance, he said, was the cash machine. For the rest, it’s all just engineering dressed up as something else. As for Greensill, it is hard to see that there was ever really a useful point to its often parasitic existence. A case in point is the logical absurdity of the Pharmacy Earlier Payment Scheme – under which Greensill takes a rate of interest for providing pharmacies with bridging finance between their wholesale purchase of drugs and later reimbursement by the National Health Service. Since the public sector can borrow at rates close to zero, it would have made a great deal more sense, and cost less, if the NHS simply paid its bills on time. In essence, the Government was paying someone to take the risk that the NHS wouldn’t pay. It made no sense at all. Whichever minister originally signed up to this scheme needs to be taken out and shot. When money is cheap and plentiful, even the most seasoned of financial practitioners, desperate for some kind of positive return, are likely to lose sight of underlying credit risks. In echoes of all those British councils that stood to lose money from the collapse of the Icelandic banks during the financial crisis, it appears that German towns have some €600m (£513m) of deposits at risk with Greensill’s German bank. Even the Cologne opera house seems to have bought the script, with €15m of deposits. There are two sides to ultra-low interest rates, quantitative easing, and the kind of fiscal largesse we have seen in play during a year of Covid. One is that it helps riskier players stay afloat, including, it might be said, national governments, which have been able to borrow, spend and invest with nothing in the way of the normal market disciplines to constrain them. The other is that it gives wind to reckless finance and corporate mischief. Government munificence extended to Greensill itself, which used the Treasury’s various Covid support schemes to underwrite hundreds of millions in loans to  . You wonder what other rubbish lies hidden beneath the £75bn of loan guarantees the Government has handed out in the past year. Similarly with Archegos, a US-based family hedge fund which though obviously not the recipient of direct government support, received funding for billions of dollars of share trades from bankers so awash with deposits that they seem wholly to have forgotten the value of money. The justification is that bountiful fiscal and monetary support has helped see the economy through the pandemic storm, insulating it against wider damage. Yet the other side of the easy money environment is that it covers up for a multitude of sins. According to the wit and wisdom of Warren Buffett, it is only when the tide goes out you get to see who’s been swimming with their trunks off. Only in this case, governments and central banks have conspired to keep the tide at the high water mark. Not until the economy recovers, the support is removed, and interest rates begin to edge up again will we get to see who has been swimming naked. Rising bond yields in the US suggest that point may be quite soon. And next time we’re unlikely to be so lucky. Unlike Greensill and Archegos, the coming wave of collapses may indeed be systemically important.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/brace-wave-financial-scandals-wake-greensill-archegos/
111,Race for heavy metals puts electric car revolution at risk,"The mining giant China Molybenedum planted its flag in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s prized 350km copper belt four years ago, paying $2.6bn (£2bn) for the Tenke Fungurume mine from Freeport McMoran. It expanded its empire in December, paying another $550m for Freeport’s nearby Kisanfu mine, giving it access to further 6.3m tonnes of copper and 3.1m tonnes of cobalt. Chinese companies now dominate mining in the central African country that produces 70pc of the world’s cobalt – a trend eyed warily around the world as others wake up to their own growing needs. As economies including the UK’s try to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, the thirst for other natural resources continues to grow. Batteries that power electric cars need cobalt and lithium, as do batteries that store power on windy and sunny days. Magnets in wind turbines need neodymium and dysprosium. Solar panels need tellurium, among other examples. The World Bank estimates 3bn tonnes of minerals will be needed in the overhaul to meet Paris climate agreement targets by 2050, with a five-fold increase in demand for some products, notes a new report by KPMG. It is thought there is enough of the materials available in the ground to go around. But mines take time and money to develop. And many materials are concentrated in certain countries such as China, Russia, and the DRC. Supply constraints and price spikes, threatening the shift to greener technologies and disruption to businesses, are on the horizon without intervention to develop supply chains, experts are warning. “The supply of clean energy depends on mined natural resources, which are steeped in geological, geopolitical and governance challenges,” says KPMG in its report published yesterday. “The very beginning of that supply chain – the sourcing of metals, minerals and resources could turn out to be the weakest link.” Civil servants raised looming raw materials crunches as far back as 2012, in a report warning of strains on supplies of some raw materials, including those used in high-tech, defence and green technologies. UK politicians have since embraced green technology that will intensify demand for those materials, banning the sale of new combustion engines by 2030 and planning a four-fold increase in wind power, as they try to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It is hoped many of those wind turbines and batteries will be made in the UK. That will require a lot of raw materials. The Faraday Institution estimates that the UK will need 14,000 tonnes of cobalt, 75,000 tonnes of lithium and 86,000 tonnes of nickel to produce 92Gwh of electric vehicle batteries in 2035. That compares to below 2,000 tonnes used today. With other economies heading in the same direction and supply slow to be developed, Benchmark Minerals Intelligence forecasts a global deficit of 216,000 tonnes of cobalt in 2030, with lithium also constrained. “It takes seven years to build a lithium mine and 24 months to build a battery plant; they live in different time zones,” says BMI’s Stephen Moores. The message to the Government has been getting louder. Last July, a government-commissioned report by Eunomia warned that the need for materials such as lithium and cobalt for grid storage batteries posed a “major threat” to the renewables sector. It also flagged the risk that China’s dominance in materials such as neodymium and dysprosium could lead to higher prices in the event of political problems. Government should investigate the possibility of further mining in the UK, including the controversial practice of mining on the sea-bed, where cobalt, titanium and tellurium might be found, it said. It stressed the need for “utmost caution from an environmental perspective”. It added the Government should take the opportunity of renegotiating trade agreements after Brexit to remove trading barriers to help import critical raw materials used in a range of sectors including energy. “This will help to reduce the reliance upon countries that are either unstable or often intervene in the market."" Ministers appear to have taken note. In its strategic defence review published this month, the Government pledges to diversify the UK’s supply in critical goods such as rare earth metals “through international trade partnerships and international collaboration”. “Starting with our G7 presidency, we will: use market-led strategies, such as targeted trade promotion and lowering barriers to trade,” it adds. Closer to home, it has been supporting work to extract lithium in Cornwall and is also investing in two new centres to work on the re-use of key materials. Other economies are taking a very proactive approach. The US, for example, in October 2019 invested $25m in UK mining veteran Brian Menell’s latest venture TechMet, which is backing AIM-listed Brazilian Nickel’s planned nickel and cobalt mine in Brazil. The money from the US’s International Development Finance Corporation marked its first direct metals and mining investment, and reflects the US’s growing desire to counter China’s dominance in materials needed for both energy and defence. Julian Treger, chief executive of London-based mining royalties business Anglo Pacific Group, which has a 2.1pc stake in Brazilian Nickel, questions why the UK does not follow suit. “We have a bunch of people in the UK doing a quality battery metals project in Brazil – but it’s being funded by and going to go to the US,” he says. “So there is a model. “One of the things I think they should look at is redeploying aid spending in more strategic ways so there’s more flow-back that’s tangibly helpful for the UK.” He adds: “It’s very frustrating because the UK has such great natural attributes. It has the incredible legacy of amazing mining companies, the Commonwealth network, the language, the London Metal Exchange – it’s all there. But it’s somehow not the focus... I think that they’re missing a beat.” Anglo Pacific has just bought a 22.8pc share of cobalt production from Vale’s Voisey’s Bay mine in Canada. “We are moving decisively and materially to cobalt, and clean cobalt,” says Treger, highlighting another trend that will affect markets. Experts say the UK is well-placed to capitalise on the need for refineries and processing plants, building on the success of Vale’s nickel refinery in Clydach, Wales, which processes nickel oxide from Vale’s smelters in Canada, and its precious metals refinery in Acton, London. “It will be of economic benefit to have a decent supply chain in the UK that processes the raw materials as well,” says Stephen Gifford, chief economist at the Faraday Institution. “It’s a whole value chain of creating the battery.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/race-heavy-metal-puts-electric-car-revolution-risk2/
112,How Denise Coates took a punt on Chinese gamblers and landed Britain's biggest pay packet,"By her own admission, Denise Coates and her brother John are “the ultimate gamblers”. It was 2001 and the dotcom bubble had recently burst, but Coates decided to place all her chips online. The Stoke siblings bought the bet365.com domain on eBay for a reported $25,000 and mortgaged her father Peter’s betting shops to secure a £15m loan from Royal Bank of Scotland to develop the website. “I was convinced early on that gambling would work on the internet,” Denise once said in a rare interview with her local newspaper. It is something of an irony that Denise, the older of the two siblings, grabs the headlines. Fiercely private, few people in the gambling industry have met her. If public appearances cannot be avoided, John fronts up to represent the company. But Wednesday’s  , has catapulted Denise Coates to the upper echelons of the world’s best-paid executives. Whether she likes it or not, paydays of this scale will both attract attention and divide opinion. And while bet365's tax and charity contributions are widely applauded, speculation persists about how much of the bookmaker's earnings come from China. Coates was born in September 1967, the eldest of four children. Peter, her father, left school at 14 and after a failed attempt to play for his beloved Stoke City football club, was shipped off on National Service before returning to take a job at the Wimpy restaurant chain. Using this experience Peter founded Stadia Catering, a specialist caterer at football grounds. Growing the business allowed him to acquire the chain of betting shops that would be pivotal in his daughter’s success. Denise took a different approach to education. As a teenager, she combined her education at a Staffordshire comprehensive school with a part-time job as a cashier in her father’s betting shops. She graduated with a first class honours degree in econometrics (the statistical branch of economics) from Sheffield University before returning to the family business in 1995, allowing her father more time to pursue his real passion as chairman of Stoke City. Coates junior was convinced that the internet was perfect for a paradigm change in sports betting. A much broader range of punters could be attracted if they could gamble from home instead of venturing to grotty smoked-filed betting shops. However, she was unable to convince some of London’s best and brightest financiers of the opportunity. Initially working from a small Portkabin, the Coates siblings knew that taking on the multi million-pound bank loan was a risky move. “We mortgaged the betting shops and put it all online. We were the ultimate gamblers, if you like,” Denise once said. The investment allowed Coates to move the business into a small open plan office. Each family member had their corner, with the IT department behind a glass partition. Originally a predominantly a tele-betting operation, bet365 eventually became an exclusively online business in the decade that followed. Peter’s shops were sold to William Hill in 2005 for £40m, releasing Denise from her debt to her father. Growth was turbocharged by Tony Blair’s desire to liberalise the UK gambling industry. Sweeping reforms - which will be revised this year in Parliament - provided operators with fertile ground. And for those that concentrated on the internet, such as Sky Bet or bet365, exponential growth followed. The siblings had a reputation for being in the detail. “Throughout my time there, they micromanaged everything,” Matthew Glazier, bet365’s head of marketing until 2010, told trade publication EGR. The Coates siblings thought nothing of working through the weekend, every weekend, according to former employees. Glazier added: “Everything went through them and every major decision required their approval. Denise was working around the clock on the betslip functionality, the new site, or the tech side of things ... nothing major was ever really delegated."" Much changed in the years that followed. Denise has juggled being one Britain’s most successful entrepreneurs with having five children. Bet365 is one of Stoke’s biggest employees, with more than 5,000 staff spread across a sprawling campus. Coates is nicknamed the “patron of the Potteries”. Bet365 continues to resist calls to break down where it makes its money on a country-by-country basis. Doing so would be “severely prejudicial to the interests of the group”, it says.  This has led to industry speculation that more than half of its revenue is generated in China, a country which is off-limits in the eyes of some of Britain's best-known bookmakers and where betting is strictly controlled.  The Stoke company said last year that it was not breaking any laws by operating in China and was not putting any of the country’s citizens at risk. The company’s most recent results, published on Wednesday for the year to March 2020, proved that bet365 was not entirely immune to the difficulties of operating in the gambling sector. Turnover fell 8pc to £2.8bn and pre-tax profit was down more than 80pc to £137m - although this was in part due to the operator’s hefty executive wage bill. As die-hard Labour supporters - Peter is one of the party's biggest donors - the Coates are not afraid to pay their share in tax. The family cemented their position as Britain’s biggest taxpayer by handing over £615m to HMRC - equivalent to roughly 0.1pc of the UK's total tax take. Wednesday's payday took Denise Coates' total pay in salary and dividends over the past five years to £1.4bn. The news divided opinion, with critics arguing that she has profited from the devastating impact that gambling addiction can have. Others insisted that the entrepreneur, who risked everything by gambling on an idea, deserved every penny. Whichever side of the debate you are on, Coates’ bet certainly paid off.  ",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/denise-coates-took-punt-chinese-gamblers-landed-britains-biggest/
113,,"Business and April Fool's jokes tend not to mix, as Volkswagen reminded everyone this week with a poorly executed gag about a name change. Its American operations would be called Voltswagen, it said, a nod to an electrical future. Get it?  Except someone forgot to remind the pranksters that the whole point of an April Fool's joke is that it is supposed to coincide with April Fool's Day, otherwise the joke is on you, and VW made the announcement a whole three days before.  Still, at least the carmaker was right about one thing: the idea that a company that will forever be remembered for   could be taken seriously when it comes to electric vehicles is certainly funny. Maybe the Germans have a sense of humour after all. So, it was good of Sanjeev Gupta to try to even things out by pretending he would explain on national radio what the future held for his   now that its chief lender Greensill Capital has gone under.  Greensill’s demise has serious implications for his sprawling metals empire and 5,000 UK jobs, most of them in the steel industry, at plants in Rotherham, Hartlepool, Motherwell and many other provincial towns. But anyone hoping for real answers from a man whose business has been an enthusiastic recipient of state support would have come away from his   disappointed. Even on the subject of how much Greensill had lent to his company GFG, Gupta said he wasn’t prepared to go into the details, other than to say it was in the “billions”.  Yet we already know from GFG’s own court testimony when Greensill crashed into administration in February that it had accumulated debts of $5bn with the firm, equivalent to the vast majority of the company’s total borrowings, it is thought. So why the reluctance to give even the most basic of financial figures?  And if  , how much longer can GFG survive? Greensill’s investors want their money back but Gupta reckons he doesn’t have to repay his loans for another three years. That sounds like wishful thinking but ultimately either a court or administrators at Grant Thornton will decide. Besides, the business has received a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers willing to back us"", he said. Yet, with much of Gupta’s business interests pledged as collateral against the money it borrowed from Greensill, unearthing new lenders will be a challenge. He also said that GFG was ""not waiting for anybody"" and those in charge were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"", so which is it? Either it needs alternative sources of financing, or it doesn’t. The idea that the company’s emergency ""Project Athena"" plan, which requires every steel plant it owns to produce daily reports on how they are conserving cash, might guarantee survival seems fanciful at best.  On the contrary, it’s merely an indication of how stretched the business is that it has been reduced to balancing the books on a day-to-day basis. A request for a £170m government loan has been turned down, a plea that Gupta tried to pass off as evidence that it was diligently exploring all avenues for new financing rather than proof that it was rapidly running out of options. To anyone listening in Scunthorpe or Stocksbridge, or any of the other towns where Gupta is a major employer, it probably sounded like there was no crisis, that this was nothing more than another bump on what he described as “a tough journey”.  Gupta even promised that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"". But who’s he trying to kid? With several winding-up petitions lodged against some of his UK companies, it may not be for him to decide.  Perhaps it’s Spring and the lighter evenings, though more likely it’s the gradual easing of lockdown, but there’s suddenly a sense of optimism in the air. First it was  , fresh from reporting an 80pc drop in turnover after its pubs were closed for three quarters of the last year.  Rather than drowning his sorrows, Emeny chose instead to raise a glass to customers ""eager to return to pubs"" with a £54m fund-raising that will help to train extra staff needed to cope when the punters return. Now, it’s Next chief Simon Wolfson who is feeling bullish. Despite a halving of profits last year,   for the coming year after a bigger-than-expected boom in online sales.  Recent trading has convinced his Lordship of several things: first that the huge shift to online shopping has not only accelerated but is here to stay; and secondly that the outlook is rosier than many anticipated. Wolfson thinks a combination of “pent-up demand” and “a healthy overall increase in personal savings” would make the “consumer economy” as he calls, “healthier than many presume”. Next was an early-mover in online shopping, invested heavily in its website, logistics, and more recently, third party brands, so Wolfson has more reason than most to be confident about the recovery. Nevertheless, for one of Britain’s most respected bosses to sound so upbeat is hugely reassuring.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/sanjeev-gupta-must-joking-future-metals-empire-far-rosy/
114,,"The German constitutional court has struck again. The fund that was supposed to save Europe is in suspended animation.  If the European project ever unravels it will probably because of a ruling by the venerable  . Each time its interventions become a greater threat. You can stretch the EU treaties and Germany’s Basic Law only so far. The normal etiquette is for the judges to issue polite requests to the German president whenever required. This time they time issued an order. Their hackles are up. The court was irritated by attempts to rush through German assent for  , an instrument that allows the European Commission to raise serious money for the first time on the capital markets. It gives Brussels a giant slush fund to play with, and it changes the constitutional order. The judges told him to withhold assent for the financing mechanism until they have reviewed a complaint by Germany’s tireless eurosceptic professors. The case could take months, possibly years. The final ruling may kill off plans to create federalist eurobonds by the back door.  It may also thwart efforts to turn the fund into a permanent EU ‘fiscal entity’, the disarming term for smuggling through an economic union, with pooled debts and a European treasury. It would eviscerate the Bundestag and national parliaments without having to put the matter to national referenda.   If the court finds in favour of plaintiffs, Southern Europe  . One can no longer rule out debt restructuring of systemic scale, either conducted in an orderly fashion within the euro, or in a disorderly fashion that breaks the euro,  .  The former would require more foresight and statecraft than Ursula von der Leyen has shown so far. Her reflex would be to prohibit investors from selling their bonds in self-protection. She would try to blame it all on “speculators”. Professor Bernd Lucke, the key litigant in the new case, told me Europe’s politicians are exploiting the pandemic to push through the next leap forward in the Project. “They are abusing the crisis to reshape the EU into a transfer union. Once they open that door, nobody will ever be able to close it,” he said. The   set off a minor earthquake last May when it ruled that the European Central Bank  , beyond its treaty powers. The ECB was no longer conducting monetary policy. It was engaging in disguised fiscal rescues under the cloak of QE bond purchases. This left German citizens on the hook for liabilities of unknown size without the democratic assent of the German parliament. The row was defused with a fudge. But the judicial warning could not be ignored. The court has constrained the ECB in critical ways. A perennial bailout is no longer possible. Markets are betting that the new case will be fudged as well. They assume that the judges will wink at creeping fiscal federalism, after some faux protest. That may happen. But this case enters more dangerous legal waters for the EU project.  “You can’t extrapolate anything from previous cases. Those were about monetary policy and the ECB, which is designed to be an independent institution. That is completely different from fiscal policy,” said Prof Lucke.  “It is a core principle of our constitution ( ) that fiscal policy stays under the control of the German parliament,” he said. Legislative power over tax and spending is the lifeblood of democracies. It was an attempt to circumvent Parliament that led to the English Civil War, a point made by Otmar Issing, the ECB’s founding chief economist. He has since turned against monetary union, calling it a “house of cards”. Prof Lucke's case invokes Article 311 of the Treaties. It states that the EU’s policy objectives “shall be financed wholly from own resources”. Under normal practice, each member state is liable only for its share of debt issuance when backing EU schemes. The Recovery Fund entails unlimited liability. If one EU state defaults on its share of the debt, the remaining members have to pick up the tab. You can easily imagine a domino effect  .  “What really worries me is if a country leaves the EU. It would no longer be legally liable for Union debt,” said Prof Lucke. Europe’s leaders have unwittingly created a device to explode their own project.  They have raised the incentive for countries to leave in future episodes of stress, with a first-mover advantage. These states would not be in the same position as the UK under Article 50: facing an inflated divorce bill set by Brussels. “Their negotiating position would be stronger,” he said. Veteran litigants are split on the likely outcome of this case. “The German elites will never give up the mad project of the euro. They will defend it like the Eastern Front,” said Gunnar Beck, an EU law professor and an MEP from the   party.   Prof Beck said the court is as ideologically besotted with EU federalism as the rest of the German establishment. “The judges are very political and they will just ignore the law as always,” he said. Political risk group   thinks the court will let the Recovery Fund go ahead but will constrain its reach and prevent it from becoming permanent. If so, this has consequences. We can debate the theoretical limits to sovereign debt in a currency union, where exchange rate risk is converted into default risk. What is clear is that the shock of Covid-19, on top of Europe’s lost decade,  . The Commission expects debt to peak at 122pc of GDP in Spain, 127pc in Portugal, 159pc in Italy, and 194pc in Greece, but that was before the Covid third wave wrecked the second quarter and threatened the summer season.  Italy’s low growth trend makes it nigh impossible to bring such a debt ratio back under control, and when Italy goes, so do others. The ECB is for now soaking up the debt and masking the problem. That becomes harder to justify once inflation picks up, even stretching the definition of monetary policy. The next line of defence is the Recovery Fund, and market assumptions that it will be expanded over time, morphing into a debt union. As long as that belief holds, debt ratios hardly matter. The German credit card will take care of all.  Markets know the fund is supposed to be temporary, a one-off emergency to cover the pandemic. It must be wound down later. Europe’s constitutional structure must return to the  , meaning a treaty club of sovereign states responsible for their own debts rather than a proto-federal state.  Bond investors in Frankfurt, London, New York, and Tokyo do not care. They think the EU will always find some way to finesse the Treaties, whatever the legal text actually says.  None other than German vice-chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, called it Europe’s “Hamilton Moment”. He was evoking American fiscal union in the 1790s - a bailout of bankrupt states by Virginia, the Deutschland of the day. But Mr Scholtz blew the game. A Hamilton Moment tramples all over the German constitution. His words will be thrown back at him.   The   may now be forced to kill off European fiscal union whether the judges like it or not.

115,,"Sadiq Khan has rolled out every excuse in the book on why London’s public transport crisis is not his fault. From being stripped of an annual Westminster grant of £700m to Boris Johnson saddling Transport for London with billions in debts during his time as mayor, Khan has insisted he is not to blame. Despite all these headwinds, London’s heroic mayor insists he had put TfL on track to being back in the black. Then Covid struck. Even Khan’s fiercest critics cannot blame him for the coronavirus pandemic. With the nation locked down for much of the last year, passenger numbers fell by as much as 90pc - and with this, most of the £5bn in fares TfL collects each year. But his opponents will underline that the Labour mayor’s boneheaded pledge to freeze fares has not helped matters. That cost £640m over the four years. Londoners should be thanking their lucky stars. Had Khan delivered Crossrail on time (it is running a mere four years late and £5bn over budget) his fare freeze could have cost the authority £1.9bn in lost fare revenue. Johnson has stumped up more than £3bn of taxpayer cash to keep TfL afloat since the pandemic hit. Now Khan wants £15.8bn for a deal that lasts until the end of the decade. In the eyes of the Tories, the problem with him is simple: give him an inch and he will take a mile. The mayor has offered “concessions” in return. These, he says, will raise an estimated £500m a year, limiting the amount of money taxpayers will need to stump up to get him out of his hole. One option is to sting those living outside the capital - many in Conservative constituencies - £5.50 to drive into greater London. It's a tax that is focused on the Tory voter; the suburban families who drive to work or drop off their kids at school. Another is for Khan to snaffle London’s share of vehicle excise duty, the levy that, much to the chagrin of cyclists, car drivers mistakenly refer to as “road tax”. Both have quite rightly been dismissed by Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary. The former is a blatant political move (one trade union leader even admitted as much to me earlier this week); the latter could open the floodgates for metro mayors across the country embarking on a similar tax grab. Khan is way ahead in the polls. It will be a miracle if anyone gets close to him when London goes to the ballot box next month. Surely this gives him licence for some bold - and potentially unpopular among his supporters - thinking. One example of this is raised by his own advisers. Unfortunately it seems to have been ignored. An independent review of TfL published in December highlights that the London council tax contribution to transport per household is £22. The average across metropolitan areas in England is £104. In Merseyside, the contribution is £146. This is worth repeating: Scousers’ bill for their public transport is seven times that of Cockneys. Khan’s experts conclude that imposing a flat council tax supplement of £130 on Londoners will generate the £500m he needs. A big jump, but one that brings the capital in line with much of the rest of the country. Alternatively, he could even rejig the supplement, known as a precept, so that it is linked to property prices, meaning the bill is shouldered by the wealthy. The problem with these options is that they are unlikely to win votes. Indeed, they could even end up putting off some of London’s champagne socialists. Khan’s tenure as London mayor is littered with examples of policies to keep his supporters happy - something that has only served to stiffen the resolve of his critics. The Met Police are independent. On property, Khan can be overruled by the ever-bungling housing minister Robert Jenrick. Whether he likes it or not, transport is one the mayor's last main vestiges of power. There are plenty of good reasons why the London public transport crisis is not Khan's fault. However, that does not absolve him of responsibility and neither does not give him carte blanche to go cap in hand to Johnson over and over again. Whether he likes it or not, this is Khan’s mess. It is time he sorted it out himself.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/sadiq-khan-cannot-keep-demanding-billions-bail-tube/
116,The Essex-born OnlyFans founder who built a porn empire,"On April 29 last year, Tim Stokely woke up to a barrage of WhatsApp messages asking if he had heard the remix of Megan Thee Stallion’s smash hit Savage. He went downstairs to his computer, opened up Spotify and pressed play. “Hips TikTok when I dance,” Beyonce chimed in on the second verse. “On that demon time she might start an OnlyFans”. Stokely, the founder of OnlyFans, was ecstatic.  “To have someone as influential as Beyonce mention us is hugely significant,” he says. “It was a proud day for us.” Since then, Stokely's unassuming family business from Essex has become   - and one of the most talked about technology companies in Silicon Valley. The subscription-for-content company is a hit with mostly   who began making large monthly incomes by charging customers for suggestive photos and videos, offering online companionship along with lingerie selfies. And as most executives were figuring out how to keep their businesses afloat, OnlyFans was going from strength to strength. ""The stay-at-home measures accelerated growth because people were looking for ways to connect online,"" he says. Rarely among   (the name given to a technology startup worth more than $1bn or £725m), Stokely says OnlyFans is profitable and on track for almost $1bn in revenue this year after spending climbed 400pc during the pandemic. Sales this month were $400m, Stokely said, of which it takes a 20pc cut. Speaking from his £2.4m Bishop’s Stortford home, the West Ham fan, whose slim frame renders him younger than his years, does not give off the air of a porn kingpin, nor the chief of one of the hottest technology companies in the world.  As many would sympathise with, the pandemic has left him grateful for the life he ""took for granted"" and realised the importance of simple pleasures like ""sitting around a dinner table with family and friends"". A banker’s son who studied property and real estate at Anglia Ruskin University, Stokely attempted five businesses before launching OnlyFans in 2016. His first entrepreneurial endeavour was in school, where he would collect orders for the local fish and chip shop, marking up the cost to deliver. After graduating he made the leap to an online fetish service, a softcore pornography website, a handyman platform and Customs4U, where customers could request adult photos and videos directly from amateur models. Working in online entertainment, he noticed that social media companies like YouTube were geared up to help give money back to a small pool of celebrities. “The business models worked for the really big influencers but not for the majority,” he says.  “Because users had to be over the age of 18 and the content on OnlyFans was securely hidden behind a payment wall, we saw creators really embrace the platform early on.” Something of a family affair, OnlyFans was backed by Stokely’s father - and former Barclays investor - Gary and steered with the help of Stokely’s brother, Tom. But it wasn’t until 2018, when he received an email from Leo Radvinsky, a Northwestern University Graduate who built one of the pornography industry’s largest adult chat websites MyFreeCams, that the company took off. Radvinsky provided cash and a wealth of experience in taking a company global in return for 75pc of the company. “Leo has a fantastic background and when we spoke, it was clear that we shared similar ideas and visions for how to take the company forward”. Stokely maintains the day-to-day running of the company with his brother, while Radvinsky remains in Miami. Creators say they like OnlyFans because they get a fair cut. Bella Thorne, a 22-year-old former Disney star, broke OnlyFans records when she made $1m in one day after promising subscribers she would send a “nude” for $200. Customers were furious to receive an image of the actress in lingerie and turned to OnlyFans for refunds.  It is not just big names making money. Jasmine Rice, 23, began earning $35,000 a month after signing up in March 2020, and Gracey Kay, a 32-year-old mother from Leeds, made double her £18,000 yearly salary as a hairdresser in just one month. But the proliferation of adult entertainment has led Stokely to be labelled as a “digital pimp”. Pictures from his early 20s taken from his Facebook page (which has since been locked down) have surfaced of him clubbing in Ibiza, flanked by busty women. He doesn’t think the moniker is fair, hitting back at the “old narrative” that all adult work is exploitation.   “There are more than 300 creators who have made more than $1m, which is a great success story,” he says. “And we are moving beyond just adult entertainment looking at the creative economy”.  “We have had a bit of a bashing but I think it comes with the territory.” Stokely says Silicon Valley investors have come knocking - or emailing - in their droves. But   understands that several are perplexed by OnlyFan's business model. Adult content is a lucrative business but its presence on the website means OnlyFans is banned from Google and Apple’s app stores. Stokely declines to comment on whether he believes this is fair or not.  If it did decide to cull adult work, analysts wonder exactly how much of OnlyFans’ sales would be impacted. Stokely says it is impossible to put a figure on how much of the content is adult, claiming it is hard to define. In some ways, this might be true. Anthia Mo, a buxom Asian American who you can pay to watch stretch in tight fitting leotards could be placed in the fitness category. Another popular creator, Desiree, could sit among the culinary genre. Yes, she shares videos of her wearing lingerie but it is while she is teaching viewers how to cook chicken.  To diversify, Stokely has added sports stars like former England flanker James Haskell and boxer Tony Bellew to the roster. The sports fan says he will be adding more athletes in the near future.  Failing to blanket ban sexual content means that huge investments must be made to protect users who are underage or at risk of exploitation if they do not want to fall foul of the law. Last year Mindgeek, the owner of Pornhub,   after accusations of sexual abuse material appearing on its website, causing payments and critical hosting companies to pull their services. Their blind eye approach is a cautionary tale for anyone dabbling in the adult world.  Stokely says there are “various levels of checks” to ensure creators are verified before they are able to sell to customers, including human and software systems. Stokely has been talking to the broadcast regulator Ofcom to discuss the upcoming  , which will surely impact how OnlyFans operates in the UK. They are “in discussions”, he says, but adds that the regulator must consider what other markets are doing, adding that “the UK only makes up 10pc of our revenue”.  “I think it is great that the UK is taking a lead in these issues but as a global social media company we would like to see a global approach from governments to provide something consistent,” he says. Then there is the raft of historical unpaid tax investigations to deal with. Stokely is still working with HMRC to work out what it owes after the treasury pointed out it would need to pay sales tax on the subscriptions customers pay. Australia, Europe and the US have also slapped the company with digital services tax.  But the opportunities could be huge. As musicians like Cardi B, Fat Joe and DJ Khalid join the platform, Stokely doesn't rule out the potential of possible record label acquisitions in the future. ""That's not something in our immediate plans but we have seen huge growth in music,"" he says. Even with busy times ahead - and a team that has shot up from four to 400 in five years, Stokely has his heart on one thing in the near future: getting down to the pub.  “It’s cliche, but all I want is to spend the afternoon in a beer garden with my friends,” he says, yearning for Covid-19 restrictions to end.   “I can’t wait for a mixture of alcohol and Vitamin D”.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/02/essex-born-onlyfans-founder-built-porn-empire-has-become-one/
117,,"Okay, let’s not get carried away. The news that the UK and Brussels are   is, of course, to be welcomed. But it’s probably a touch early to break out the bunting and start organising street parties.  The two sides have finalised the contents of a   that should lead to the creation of a “joint UK-EU financial regulatory forum”. That’s even less exciting than it sounds. It’s not so much a deal, more the establishment of a new talking shop.  Whatever your view of Brexit, there can be little debate that the best trade agreement for the City of London was the one that it had before the UK voted to leave the European Union: full access to the single market and an outsized say in the shaping of its financial regulations. As of now, there are certain services that UK-based firms are simply not allowed to provide European clients.  The new “deal” is therefore a bit like suspending all the Eurostar, Eurotunnel and ferry services between the UK and the continent and then laying on a few replacement pedalos. Actually, that’s not quite right. It’s more like agreeing a quorum to timetable future discussions on the feasibility of introducing pedalos at an as yet unspecified date. This is the point we have reached. Since the referendum, expectations about the kind of deal the Government would be able to secure for the financial industry have gradually dwindled to almost nothing. The City has at least become inured to disappointment: it expected little from the Christmas Eve Brexit deal and got even less.  Most firms were ready. They started preparing for a hard Brexit as soon as they heard the referendum result in 2016. As the head of the European operations of a US investment bank said to me: “I was upset by Brexit when it was going to cost me a lot of money. But now that I've spent it, I don’t really care.” Indeed there are a growing number of voices in the financial industry suggesting that the UK probably shouldn’t even bother   - the last great hope for the City’s future relationship with the bloc. That’s because, whisper it quietly, equivalence is pretty rubbish too.  For starters, it is not, as is sometimes assumed, a single catchall solution. Equivalence, where firms are granted access to a market because the regulatory regime in their country is considered comparable, applies in about 40 different areas, each of which would potentially have to be separately negotiated and agreed. The EU has, for example, already granted equivalence in clearing for 18 months. The UK will probably be able to push for equivalence in less contentious areas like data uniformity and insurance. It would be nice to get it for equities and derivatives trading venues. But don’t hold your breath on that one.  What’s worse, in asking for equivalence, the UK would effectively be signing up to EU financial rules without having any say in shaping them. That’s fine right now as the UK and EU regulatory regimes are basically identical. But it would prevent the UK from diverging in any meaningful way over time, thus undermining one of the stated rationales for Brexit. Indeed, the EU has already demanded the UK map out its future regulatory plans as a prerequisite to any possible agreement. However, the single biggest problem with equivalence is that it is granted unilaterally. It is not a deal; it is the EU’s gift. And what Brussels giveth, Brussels can most certainly taketh away. Why on earth would the UK agree to having a sword hung over its most important industry?  All of which is why Philip Hammond, when Chancellor, described a third-country equivalence regime as “wholly inadequate” for the scale and complexity of UK-EU financial services trade. He argued it was “never meant to carry such a load”. He was right. It could be argued that equivalence is better than nothing. And it has certainly been used by other “third countries”. The US, for example, has cleared euro-denominated derivative trades on such a basis for years.  But that arrangement works because it so clearly benefits both sides. The relationship between the UK and the EU is manifestly more antagonistic and will likely remain so for years to come. The Bank of England this week raised concerns that European regulators are asking financial firms to relocate more jobs and operations to the continent than are strictly necessary from a prudential perspective. Trust is in pretty short supply right now.  What's more, the EU has reportedly said it is in ""no hurry"" to grant equivalence. The longer the UK spends on a doomed mission, the less time it will have to focus on other opportunities.  Over the past 15 years, the EU’s share of global financial activity has shrunk by a third and been overtaken by Asia in almost every sector, according to New Financial. The think tank has forecast Asia’s share of global finance will rise from 30pc in 2018 to 54pc in 2040. This is one area where the City should be looking for new customers.  The UK, along with the US, specialises in the kind of cross-border financial business that might most appeal to them. The two countries account for about 70pc of all global derivatives trading, for example. This is one area where the City should be looking to help shape global financial standards.  Hammond pooh-poohed equivalence because he was angling for a closer relationship along the lines of “mutual recognition”, whereby the UK and EU would jointly determine their rules were robust enough to allow two-way access. That hope proved forlorn.  But equivalence also prevents a closer relationship with other markets. It would place the City in a kind of regulatory limbo - neither in nor out of the single market.  If that's all there is on offer, then it’s looking increasingly like any form of financial services deal between the UK and the EU - beyond a regular catch up and chat - is a complete non-starter.  Time to move on.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/city-starting-give-eu/
118,Next boss Simon Wolfson: the three issues that will decide the future of retail,"As retail appetite shifts irreversibly online and stores get quieter, Next's legions of shop floor staff have more time on their hands.  The retailer is now experimenting with how it can get these employees helping out with the call centre to assist its burgeoning £2.3bn online business. They could answer shoppers’ questions about furniture, for example, in between shifts talking to customers face to face. Shop staff have also taken on some of the simpler returns of unwanted goods and some basic packaging work. Lord Simon Wolfson, chief executive of 30 years, says this is an experiment - but confirms Next is looking at ways to shift staff into the virtual world and away from physical stores. “We haven’t really worked out what the best mode of operation is, but it’s something we’re actively investigating … in the next six months.""  The move highlights just how complex the changing dynamic between physical retail and e-commerce has become after a year of phenomenal growth in internet orders.  Unlike many other traditional high street players, Wolfson has long had an eye on the online world. He believes the pandemic has speeded up a trend which retailers must accept and learn to live with, instead of swimming against the tide. “History has been given a shove and, having moved forward, seems unlikely to reverse,” Next says in its annual results. In Wolfson's view, there will still be a place for physical stores even as footfall dwindles. But he believes property owners and ministers have a part to play in keeping the high street alive.  “The future of retail is going to be driven by three things,"" he says.  ""Most important will be consumers. At the end of the day if consumers don’t want to shop in shops, they don’t. Secondly, landlords. As landlords continue to be as pragmatic in determining rents going forward, that will allow shops to stay open. And thirdly, we do need some form of settlement on business rates [reform].” A report this week by GlobalData found online sales at chains with a physical store network are growing faster than at those without one, supporting Wolfson's view. Online sales have been stronger than Next expected in the ﬁrst two months of the year and are up more than 60pc from two years ago. Wolfson nonetheless rejected suggestions that he would just pull the plug on the chain's 491 stores, stressing that the battle to keep the high street open is far from over. He is prepared to shrug off losses in stores of about £20m this year, mostly because of the third lockdown, compared with an expected profit of £560m in the online business. “I can’t see any reason why someone would shut a profitable shop,” he says. “As long as rents and business rates continue to keep the pace with the sales decline, we certainly wouldn’t shut a profitable shop. I can’t see why anyone else would either.” Next closed 18 shops and renegotiated leases for 62 sites as they expired in the past year and slashed its average rent at these sites by 58pc. It also accelerated investment online, spending £121m on warehousing and systems during the year, which helped increase capacity and cope with elevated demand. Amy Higginbotham, a retail analyst at GlobalData, says: “Next successfully transferred shoppers to its website while stores were closed during periods of lockdown."" This was particularly true in the second half of the year, she says, when online sales grew £364m and almost entirely offset the £368m decline in retail sales. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, says that although the benefits of operating physical stores are less tangible, they are not negligible. “If you are a retailer like Joules, which has fewer stores, you could argue that you will be getting a lot of your customer recruitment through your physical space. In the case of Next, it’s more about that relationship with the customer.” Next brings considerable value to market towns where it typically is the only store where customers can buy a plethora of third-party products, Stevenson says. It sells hundreds of other fashion brands, such as Barbour and Tommy Hilfiger, on its website under the so-called Label umbrella. Next says that a decade ago, online sales overseas and Label were “mere glints in the corporate eye” but are now forecast to make £1.3bn this year, accounting for a third of the group’s sales and 28pc of its profits. Stevenson adds: “Next is not going to be running subsidised stores, they are very dispassionate about that - if it’s not measurable, they’ll cut it … but there’s an absolute relevance to that store base.” According to Wolfson, stores will remain marginally profitable even with sales down 20pc on pre-pandemic levels. Ever the contrarian, the chief executive says it does not make sense for Next to refit its existing space as this would cost too much. Rivals such as John Lewis and Marks & Spencer are both seeking to convert some of their retail space to offices or even housing in the case of the former. Wolfson insists that he will only consider shutting stores when a lease comes up for renewal. “My experience of both growing the store estate before 2016 and beginning to wind it down, is that the decision is best made on a store-by-store basis with the area manager that understands what’s going on,"" he says. ""Trying to do that in the boardroom is the wrong way to build a store portfolio.” It is fighting talk. But even so, the fight to keep stores relevant in an online world is just beginning.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/next-shares-climb-online-sales-take/
119,,"David Cameron has long been dogged by porcine allusions. “Where is the geezer?” asked the actor Danny Dyer of the ex-prime minister amid the chaos that followed the Brexit referendum. “In Nice with his trotters up?” Right animal, wrong extremity. We now know the former First Lord of the Treasury and heir to Attlee, Lloyd George and Churchill was busy  . As   about Cameron’s long association with the disgraced banker Lex Greensill has surfaced - the lobbying, the stock options, the private jets, Lex’s Downing Street business card, the boys’ camping trip with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the stench has become harder to stomach. But, in many ways, the overriding tenor of this grubby saga is one of bathos. Among the most striking aspects is how little Cameron was able to help Greensill. The banker was  , a desk in the cabinet office and his own team of officials. He is thought to have pitched at least 11 different government departments and agencies. And yet he was only able to launch one scheme - to reimburse pharmacies the cost of providing prescription drugs rather than having to wait for the NHS to cough up. Civil servants were reportedly worried about the economics of even that deal, trying to figure out who benefited and wondering why, if the problem was late payments, the Government didn’t just pony up a little more promptly. Good questions. Shame the PM didn’t think to ask. After throwing off the shackles of public office, Cameron accepted a job lobbying for Greensill. But calls to the Treasury and personal texts to Chancellor Rishi Sunak last year failed to secure a bailout for the company with taxpayer funded loans. Our institutions have had a rough ride in recent years. Dominic Cummings famously railed against the civil service and the Whitehall machine. He thought that it was too sclerotic and prevented things from getting done. The   perhaps shows that a little sclerosis may be no bad thing for the body politic.  That said, Cameron was just as ineffective internationally. His charm offensive on Saudi Arabia, including attendance of the so-called “Davos in the Desert” summit in Riyadh just a year after the  , failed to win Greensill any lucrative contracts with state-controlled oil company Saudi Aramco. Cameron was like the anti-Midas. We haven’t heard from the man himself so we don’t know if he’s planning to play the incompetence card. Certainly, the defences of the former prime minister’s behaviour mounted on his behalf have been pretty threadbare. One line is that he didn’t break the rules. True. Perhaps that’s because they weren’t drawn up to take account of politicians who view elected office not so much as the pinnacle of their careers but rather as a bullet point halfway down their CVs. Cameron’s outriders also say he has the right to earn a living. Total strawman. Nobody said he didn’t. Cameron was supposedly making £120k a pop for speaking engagements. The £60m he was reportedly set to make from Greensill options would have represented dynastic wealth not a living. Cameron’s defenders are also not joining the dots. The problem wasn’t so much that he invited a businessman into the heart of government to solve a problem that didn’t really exist. That was just poor judgement. It wasn’t even that he accepted a highly paid lobbying job after getting into a huff with the electorate for voting the wrong way in the referendum and storming out of Number 10. That’s just a bit icky.  The problem is that he went to work for the very same man he had invited into the heart of government. He blurred the demarcation line between his public and private careers to the point of non-existence. If it didn’t break the rules, we need new ones.  This isn’t just about one man and his weapons-grade sense of entitlement. The points on the sliding scale between chumocracy, sleaze, crony capitalism and outright corruption can too easily elide. Where, for example, should we place the dealings of housing secretary Robert Jenrick with property developers, or contracts issued by health secretary Matt Hancock to certain PPE suppliers?  This stuff is deeply insidious. Sure it further undermines trust in politicians. More importantly it will make it harder for future governments to draw on the expertise of private companies - either in shrinking the state to make it more efficient or, as during the pandemic, scaling up at speed to deal with an emergency.  What we really need is more self-aware politicians and a greater sense of probity in public life. In the meantime we should redouble our efforts to lampoon those who, just for example, attack Silicon Valley companies for not paying enough tax, say they’re “not especially bedazzled by Facebook” and then scuttle off to become Mark Zuckerberg’s bag carrier as soon as they’ve been booted out by the electorate.  There must be far greater transparency of government contracts. It can’t be right that civil servants were asking questions about the mechanics of Greensill’s pharmacies scheme and unable to get straight answers. If these deals are not comprehensible to a layperson then the assumption must be that there’s something nasty hiding in the small print.  The Government should introduce a time-limited ban on politicians working for any company with which you have had direct dealings while in office and establish a separate body to police it. If that greatly reduces the options for ex-ministers, tough. Use the time to polish up your memoirs in a shepherd's hut or something.  Lastly, it's a deeply unpopular measure, but reducing the number of MPs and increasing the salaries of the remainder would get my vote.  You pay acorns, you get Dave.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/camerons-sleazy-lobbying-exposes-weapons-grade-sense-entitlement/
120,US adds almost 1m jobs in March as Biden boom gains momentum,"US employers added almost 1m jobs last month as vaccines and President Biden’s $1.9 trillion (£1.4 trillion) stimulus keeps the world’s biggest economy on track for a Reagan-era boom this year. The 916,000 Americans hired in March was far greater than the 660,000 forecast and the highest for seven months, taking the unemployment rate down to 6pc.  The figures showed a broad-based recovery led by a 280,000 surge in leisure and hospitality jobs as states gradually loosened Covid restrictions. The March revival still leaves the US more than 8m jobs short of its February 2020 peak, but the combination of the rapid vaccine rollout, $1,400 stimulus cheques and infrastructure spending are expected to pour rocket fuel on the economy this year. Almost 40pc of America's adult population has been vaccinated. The Federal Reserve predicts growth of 6.5pc in 2021, the best since 1984 and almost twice as fast as the eurozone economy struggling to vaccinate and succumbing to a third wave. Chairman Jay Powell has also warned that the Covid recovery was “far from complete” and pledged to keep monetary policy ultra-loose in a further tailwind to the economic revival. The latest Fed forecasts suggest rate-setters will keep interest rates at record lows until at least 2023. But James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the gathering jobs market momentum could force the central bank’s hand. “It's not inconceivable that all the jobs lost during the pandemic are regained before year-end, which if the case it would mean Federal Reserve rate hikes could come as soon as next year,"" he said. ""A 2022 rate hike is more likely than a 2024 first move.”  Alongside bars and restaurants, construction firms took on 110,000 workers after bad winter weather while manufacturers hired an extra 53,000 - the highest tally since September. However, the sheer size of the monetary and fiscal stimulus being turned on the US economy has also prompted warnings of inflation from prominent figures including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. President Biden’s $2 trillion American Jobs Plan, partly funded by corporate tax rises, is also set to create millions of jobs in construction and renewing the country's creaking infrastructure and tackling climate change.  Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said: “Particular segments of the labor market - like leisure & hospitality and education - remain weak because of the ongoing restrictions, but the opposite is true in many other sectors. The upshot is that an acceleration in wage growth in those better-placed sectors could add to the upward pressure on prices this year.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/us-jobs-surge-biden-boom-gains-momentum/
121,Banks fear billions of losses over Gupta debts,"Sanjeev Gupta has threatened to take legal action against banks racing to recover billions of pounds owed by his steel empire amid fears that lenders will be saddled with massive uninsured losses if the business collapses. The tycoon's company GFG Alliance is being pursued by Credit Suisse in a bid to recover funds caught up in the failure last month of his biggest lender Greensill Capital. City sources said the Swiss bank is concerned that losses from Mr Gupta's sprawling businesses, complicated by an opaque financial structure, may not be covered by its insurance.  Ahead of a meeting between the two sides for preliminary talks, Mr Gupta told the  that he was prepared to go to court to keep creditors getting at bay - and insisted he could keep the company afloat despite growing scepticism about its future. It came as the  reported that companies named in invoices on which GFG's finances depended claimed never to have done business with it. The  reported that German scrap metal dealer RPS Siegen had been approached about an outstanding invoice but had never traded with Mr Gupta's businesses. GFG declined to comment. Mr Gupta said: ""We need to either find a standstill with the lenders, or we need to litigate in court because we have three-year committed facilities. As far as we're concerned, we have a solid defence. It's not something which happens in one day, it needs to be structured properly."" Credit Suisse joined an hour-long meeting between Greensill administrator Grant Thornton and Mr Gupta on Thursday afternoon amid fears it will face further losses if GFG fails. The bank helped Greensill package up loans and sell them to investors. It is one of a number of banks that has been left more than £1bn out of pocket by the implosion of Lex Greensill's eponymous lending empire. Credit Suisse's unusual intervention comes after   was filed against GFG’s Liberty Commodities  by Citibank, which provides administrative services for the Swiss group. It is understood at least two other British steel businesses run by Mr Gupta are also the subject of winding up petitions, casting doubts over the jobs of 3,000 workers. Grant Thornton is seeking to recover losses suffered by Credit Suisse and other creditors after the collapse of  .    understands that Mr Gupta now has a month to secure some sort of deal to stabilise GFG, with courts not expected to hear the winding up petitions until May 5.   GFG has been teetering on the brink of collapse since the  , which provided Mr Gupta with billions of pounds in controversial supply chain funding. He vowed to keep steel plants open and offered a ""personal guarantee"" to staff on the pledge. Mr Gupta added that Liberty's British plants are a ""labour of love"" and warned of the dangers of creditors filing winding-up petitions in court against his businesses. He said: “It makes no sense for them to destroy jobs of my workers. Maybe creditors don't care about that but they do care about is recovery for their stakeholders, and by taking aggressive action they're destroying their own value."" Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham where Liberty's steelworks employs 900 staff, said: ""There is no doubting Sanjeev's personal commitment to the UK steel industry. What is more concerning is is whether he can get the financing to back up his ambition.""  The Government has repeatedly said it will do ""all it can"" to support the UK steel industry, despite turning down a request for a £170m emergency loan last week due to concerns about GFG's structure.  Boris Johnson sent a signal ministers could step in on Thursday, saying he considered the industry a ""great national asset and the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance"". He added: ""I'm very hopeful we will get a solution."" Mr Gupta, whose GFG group has about 35,000 staff worldwide and employs 5,000 people in the UK, defended his use of Greensill and supply chain financing to  . He said: “At the time when Greensill came to give us funding, it was a breath of fresh air because they believed in our business model. “We have bought plant after plant which was either shut or shutting. In those situations you cannot access normal, conventional funding. Without the help of Greensill we would not have been able to build this business.” Mr Gupta said his business was ""months away"" from sealing a refinancing deal that moved to more conventional funding before the current crisis engulfed it.  Greensill has come under scrutiny over its hiring of former Prime Minister David Cameron as an adviser.  Despite the current troubles, Mr Gupta said that “most of our operations in the UK and the world are very good plants and doing extremely well”. He said he has been getting a “huge amount of interest” from new financial backers, and was confident in the future of the UK steel industry.",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/steel-magnate-gupta-owes-many-billions-greensill/
122,,"While last week’s Line of Duty   saw many of its record 9.6 million viewers fixated on the show’s bewildering acronyms (in particular, the rude-sounding  ), talk of the   was of Jimmy Savile.  As anti-corruption unit AC-12 looked into the murder investigation of journalist Gail Vella, they watched videos of her past reporting - which played rather like a  , but with some queasy real-life policing chucked in.  In one clip, Vella (Andi Osho) covered the conviction of former chief superintendent  , an unmasked member of a VIP paedophile ring who we last saw in series three of the drama. Jed Mercurio courted controversy then by including a doctored image of Fairbank and another suspect, local politician Dale Roach, alongside the real-life sex offender Jimmy Savile. But Savile wasn’t actually name-checked in the show until last night. In her report, referencing the cover-ups perpetrated by figures like Fairbank, Vella said: “It’s now a matter of public record that Jimmy Savile cultivated relationships with senior police officers” - accompanied once again by that image of Savile with Fairbank and Roach, blurring reality and fiction. Vella continued: “Savile exploited those relationships to intimidate anyone attempting to investigate his offending. We now realise what Savile was getting out of those relationships with senior police officers. What remains unknown - and uninvestigated - is what those officers were getting out of their relationship with Savile.” The explicit references to Savile shocked many viewers, who shared their uneasiness on Twitter. One commented “A Savile storyline? Poor taste to put it politely”, while another said: “Bloody hell, Mr Mercurio is going a bit bloody close to the bone with this one.” However, former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal also took to Twitter, pointing out that “Jimmy Savile has been involved in more criminal conspiracies than anyone I’ve ever dealt with - real & fictional. No surprise he turns up in #LineofDuty.” Previously,   between the police and Savile, saying: “The fact is that Savile bragged of his close relationships with officers.” The series three storyline strongly evoked Operation Yewtree, and a subsequent investigation into links between organised crime and corrupt officers, in series five, had the very similar name of Operation Pear Tree. So, is Mercurio attempting some amateur detective work via his drama, in the vein of Serial or Tiger King? Or is he just using   to spice up the series? If the latter, he’s treading on dangerous ethical ground. It’s also a far cry from the   of Line of Duty, with its deliberately vague geographical setting (an unnamed city in the Midlands), fictional forces like Central Police, and clearly invented characters. That distancing allowed viewers to delve into the world of modern policing, while still enjoying it as a TV drama. But series six is inching ever more into our world - with uncomfortable results. It wasn’t just Savile who made a startling appearance last night. The late Vella’s producer told AC-12 that she was doing her own podcast, to reveal truths that she couldn’t get on air, and that she was inspired by the podcast on Daniel Morgan. Again, this is a blatant true-crime reference. The cited podcast -  , presented by Peter Jukes and brother Alistair Morgan - delves into the murder of the private investigator in 1987. It alleges that Morgan had uncovered major corruption and drug trafficking within the Metropolitan Police, and that he was killed to stop him exposing it. Morgan’s murder officially remains unsolved. There’s also the inescapable parallels between Line of Duty’s Vella case and the killing of   - including the police questioning whether the perpetrator was an obsessive fan (the accused Barry George in real life; Terry Boyle in the drama), or whether this was a professional hit job. Mercurio’s series has always had a basis in actual policing. The writer consults retired and servicing officers on his scripts, and scans anonymous police blogs. That’s evident in the series’ assiduous use of  , regulations, paperwork, and painstaking interviews.  But this latest series is much blunter about dragging in real-world parallels, making it jarring for viewers. There is still a certain suspension of disbelief needed to make Line of Duty work, and that’s at odds with its fictional journalist actually commentating on Savile. Vella also referenced series one’s corruption case, involving a counter-terrorism squad raiding the wrong flat and shooting an innocent man, then lying to cover each other’s backs. AC-12’s Superintendent Hastings, played by  , is particularly outraged that the unit’s commanding officer - who led the cover-up - was then “made chief”. The plot line is obviously inspired by the murder of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly identified as a suicide bomber by the Met and gunned down at Stockwell Tube station in 2005; in the aftermath, officers initially lied about their actions. So, is this Mercurio criticising the appointment of Cressida Dick - who headed the operation - as Met chief? Dick has also, of course, been in the news recently after her force’s poor handling of the Sarah Everard vigil. An unrepentant Dick has expressed outrage at Mercurio’s portrayal of “the level of casual and extreme corruption” in the police. And while the series isn’t a documentary, and makes no such claims, it does have certain responsibilities as a popular primetime BBC programme. Can Mercurio really make allegations about actual crimes and police officers via his show?  It might be just about acceptable legally - even, some might argue, a public service - but it’s dubious dramatically. If we’re meant to be viewing Line of Duty with the sober earnestness applied to the Dando, Savile or de Menezes cases, that’s a very different proposition to enjoying a Sunday-night thriller with some basis in reality, but which takes plenty of creative license. In short: it sucks the fun out of it. Start treating the realm of Line of Duty as one bound by the rules of actual policing, and the whole thing collapses. Of course our AC-12 team would have been disbanded by now, given their many and various misdemeanours (not least sleeping with an unending string of suspects and witnesses). Nor should they be investigating the unit where their former colleague, Kate Fleming, works. That’s a job for AC-1-through-11, surely. And series three’s   is utterly absurd if you place it in a real-world context. Mercurio should also take care that he doesn’t put the spotlight on his own actions. A telling line in last night’s episode, in reference to Vella, was “female journalists get the worst of it.” Well, they do from Mercurio, who attacked a Guardian journalist on Twitter in 2019 for daring to criticise his show and, speaking to GQ earlier this month, doubled down by calling her a c___. Opening up Line of Duty to serious scrutiny is a Pandora’s box. Mercurio might well regret it - and so will his viewers.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/line-duty-needs-stop-pretending-takes-place-real-world/
123,UK to use G7 presidency to join Biden's China challenge,"Britain is set to use its presidency of the G7 to join the US in seeking ways to combat China’s multi-trillion dollar infrastructure  , potentially setting up an alternative system for democracies to seize the initiative,   understands. President Joe Biden proposed the idea on a phone call with Boris Johnson last month, calling for “a similar initiative, pulling from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help”. It also means pushing back against the   (BRI) which China has used to spread its influence through Asia, Africa and parts of Europe. It is understood that the UK will take up the call, using its   group of major economies to discuss the idea behind the scenes. Britain and its allies are unlikely to embark on a similar state-led scheme to fund projects such as ports and rail routes across the globe, for fear of being mired in ventures that are not economically viable. Instead the aim is likely to be to encourage well-governed private sector projects, showing developing nations that there is an alternative to Chinese money while boosting economic growth and trade. “Beijing is using the BRI not simply to bring foreign infrastructure and assets into Chinese ownership, in some cases for potential military use such as port facilities, but to export its authoritarian norms,” said Radomir Tylecote at the think tank Civitas. “A high-level US-led strategy in response is a heartening proposal. It is also a natural strategic move for this country, as post-Brexit the UK begins to strengthen its Five Eyes and Indo-Pacific bonds.” He suggests the UK begins by pulling out of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, and taking a more strategic approach to the funding of crucial technologies. “To help wean UK universities, for example, off the dangerous dependence that some have developed on Chinese military-linked organisations, Five Eyes partners could coordinate and increase defence research funding while stipulating that no such funding would go to universities which are sponsored by Chinese military organisations, as a strategic challenge to China’s military advancement,” he said. “China’s approach to 5G investments suggests we should consider technological cooperation among democracies. The UK and allies will also need to better prioritise their infrastructure funding for developing countries.” James Carafano at the Heritage Institute wants democracies to present an alternative to the Chinese model. “The way China has tried to implement the Belt and Road has been incredibly destabilising. They are selling poverty, doing resource extraction, they are not doing the kind of things that contribute to regional stability. And they are gaining tremendous geopolitical influence, which is a threat,” he said. “We should work together to counter that, but how we counter that is what really matters. There is a lot that the US, UK and Europe can do. The big force we have to bring to the table is the private sector.” Setting a framework for transparent, well-governed investment could simultaneously boost the economy, lessen Chinese influence and force China to improve its behaviour, he said. “In the Middle East, north Africa or Latin America, the Chinese are not necessarily the partner of choice. If there is an alternative to that which creates wealth and sustainable economic growth and brings real stability, and doesn’t bring the baggage of the Chinese telling you what to do, that is a fairly attractive option,” said Mr Carafano. “By doing this, if it is successful, in order for the Chinese to compete they are going to have to change their ways. It might force the Chinese to clean up their act a little bit.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/uk-use-g7-presidency-join-bidens-china-challenge/

There are new films out - in  ! - plus   musicals, David Hockney, opera, ballet and jazz.  As if that wasn’t action-packed enough, add in the bizarrely tone-deaf decision by   organisers to hold a live-streamed version of their festival on Saturday May 22 - the first weekend when these arts institutions might hope to resume their in-person activities, following the May 17 date (step three) on the  . Now, not only do smaller music venues, in particular, have to contend with ensuring that visitors feel safe to return, and putting in place social distancing and other measures, but they also have to lure people away from Glastonbury’s starry line-up - which includes  , Damon Albarn and   - and the ease of catching it from your sofa. Of course, many music fans would say that there’s no contest between watching bands on a small screen at home and actually being in a club, seeing performers live, and revelling in the atmosphere of the energetic crowd around you. (Albeit safely spaced.)  Nevertheless, it’s an extra option that we really didn’t need for this weekend of, yes, liberation, but also one that presents the paralysing dilemma of hundreds of choices, when for many of us, life has been whittled down to simply “Walk now” or “Walk later”. Not to mention May 22 is also the   grand final, offering yet another tantalising reason to stay glued to a screen. But even if you have made the decision to go out, where to start? This, of course, is a luxurious problem, one that we’ve been longing for over months of tedium. Nevertheless, it might prove bewildering at first, particularly if you’re keen to support numerous venues that you know have been in dire straits.  Plus, there’s the option to add in lunch, or dinner, or drinks - though remember that the rule of six people or two households still applies while indoors, so we’re not quite at full party levels yet.  Then there’s the question of what sort of cultural experience you most want post-lockdown. Something brand new, or revisiting old favourites? Are you after pure sugar-rush escapism, something intellectually stimulating and absorbing, or a proper cathartic cry-fest?  Whatever your preference, we’ve got you covered.

125,"The best classical CDs and DVDs of 2021 so far, from Simon Rattle to Clare Hammond","The Traveller of this delightful album is the Sicilian born-and-bred cellist Alessio Pianelli, a Fellow of the prestigious Borletti-Buitoni Awards scheme for talented young musicians. The award provided the wherewithal to make this recording, in which Pianello makes a musical tour through the folk traditions of Balkan and near Eastern countries before ending in his own beloved native island. In the liner notes Pianelli reminds us Sicily has been constantly invaded by settlers who left traces of their culture behind, but he isn’t pedantic about historical accuracy – in fact only the three Greek folk-songs arranged by the reclusive and still-undiscovered Greek modernist Nikos Skalkottas could plausibly claim a connection with Sicily. The real thread linking them is Pianelli’s own curiosity and taste, which is clearly good because he’s unearthed some real folk gems, all arranged by notable composers from their respective countries. The most familiar things on the disc are the seven Romanian folk dances originally collected and arranged by Béla Bartók. They are wonderful, but much more intriguing are the seven Miniatures by Georgian composer Sulkhan Tsintsadze, the five folk-songs arranged by the Armemian priest Komitas, who almost lost his life during the Armenian genocide, and those three Greek folk-songs. Standing somewhat to one side are Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s Negro Melodies, which remind one irresistibly of Dvořák. To record these songs Pianelli first of all re-arranged them for solo cello and the Rome-based Avos string orchestra. It’s an immense labour of love which Pianelli has carried out with great tact as well as musical imagination. The deep tragedy of the Armenian songs, the lighter charm of the Georgian melodies, and the eccentric, tangy quality of the Greek pieces all shine through, thanks to Pianelli’s playing which is changeable as quicksilver and mournful as a folk balladeer. At the end Pianelli returns home, playing his own witty variations on a Sicilian melody. It’s a fine end to a disc that glows with Mediterranean and Near Eastern heat, and if we really can’t get away to the sun this summer it will bring some comfort. Intimacy and grandeur seem the least likely bedfellows, but it’s precisely that unlikely conjunction that gives Elgar’s music its unique flavour. So often in his music a huge public utterance girded with brass and military rhythms seems to melt away before our very ears, and we suddenly find ourselves in a twilight landscape of regret and nostalgia. In no work is that special quality more hauntingly evident than the Violin Concerto. Elgar composed it in 1910 in response to a request from the American virtuoso Fritz Kreisler, who was determined to have a concerto from the man he said was the greatest living composer. Elgar responded with a concerto on the same heroic scale as Brahms’s, full of vaunting virtuoso passages where the violinist has to dominate the orchestra. But unlike Brahms’s it has a cadenza which instead of being a moment of heroic display is a tender rumination on previously heard ideas, accompanied by thrumming plucked chords which – in this performance at least – sound like the quiet rustling of nature on a summer afternoon. French violinist Renaud Capuçon turns out to be an ideal soloist for this very English work. He catches the music’s quicksilver spirit, the way at one moment it’s gathering pace and intensity towards a high point, the next hesitating in small, shy phrases, or pulling back by degrees towards a moment of radiant calm, like a patch of sunlight in a forest. Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra are every bit as sensitive and labile, and the subtle weave of Elgar’s orchestration takes on a lovely glow. If I don’t place it right at the top of available recordings of the concerto that’s because it feels a touch too spacious and meditative, missing that eager, impetuous quality that the recent recording by James Ehnes and the Philharmonia Orchestra catches so well. About the recording of the sonata in which Capuçon is partnered by pianist Stephen Hough I have no such reservations. The dialogue between pianist and violin is beautifully clear, and the balance between tender soliloquy and grandiloquence feels exactly right. Some pianists charm and caress you with subtle shadings and half-tones, some seize you by the scruff with steely-fingered decisiveness. Clare Hammond is definitely one of the latter sort. Her latest album, an exploration of the art of variation – i.e. ringing ever-more elaborate changes on a pattern or melody announced at the beginning – certainly shows off that aspect of her talent. It avoids the familiar masters of the genre like Beethoven and Schumann, focusing instead on 20th and 21st-century pieces. Among them is the Variations by Aaron Copland, a piece that will instantly disabuse anyone of the idea that Copland was just a purveyor of cheerful, all-American folksiness. Its pitiless, hard-edged abstraction made it a favourite of Leonard Bernstein, who took a mischievous delight in emptying the room at swanky Manhattan parties by playing it at full volume. Hammond makes it seem as huge and steely as the Brooklyn Bridge, but without resorting to sheer force. She balances the sonorities carefully, so we can hear the original idea gleaming through all the dissonant barbed-wire Copland erects around it.  The same combination of power and dramatic sweep with careful attention to detail can be heard in the other pieces. In the craggy, immense Chaconne by Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina she allows no respite from the drama, which builds in waves of rising and falling tension to the final dénoument. She softens the sinews of Hindemith’s severe 1936 Variations with subtle tempo variations, and brings a nice sense of cat-like stealth to Birtwistle’s Variations on the Golden Mountain. Not everything is hard and monumental. John Adams’s I Still Play has a diffident waltz-like charm. And the Variations on a Polish Theme by Karol Szymanowski is as far from Copland as you could imagine. The piece is in his most impressionist, sensuous vein, and Hammond responds with a delicate but still firmly shaped touch, and a deft use of pedal that reveals the bones under all the luxurious flesh. It may not be a masterpiece but Hammond keeps us enthralled to the last bar. Der Freischütz (“The Freeshooter”) was one of the smash operatic hits of the 19th century. Carl Maria von Weber’s dark tale of a hunter who makes with a pact with the devil so he can win a shooting competition and win the head forester’s daughter was the spark that lit the German Romantic revolution in opera. Wagner was electrified by it, and said that without Der Freischütz he would never have become a composer. By the end of the 19th century the opera’s naïve supernatural trappings, such as the chorus of gibbering spirits gathered in a forest clearing at midnight, were starting to seem creaky. In the early 21st century there are other reasons to be embarrassed by Der Freischütz, especially the heartily patriarchal culture of back-slapping hunters and docile womenfolk. But never fear. This combined CD/DVD offers a French production from 2019 which couldn’t possibly embarrass anyone. The name is a giveaway: “The Freischütz Project”. It suggests this opera can’t simply be presented, it must be given a makeover to make it palatable to modern tastes. Some aspects of the makeover are actually welcome. The Insula Orchestra uses “period” instruments appropriate to the early 19th century, so the biting horns and twilight gloom of Weber’s orchestration seem unusually vivid. The performances, especially Johanni van Oostrum as the faithful Agathe are strong. Other aspects of the makeover are simply annoying. Both the CD and the DVD offer only highlights of the opera, so neither gives a complete narrative. The charming bridal chorus sung by Agathe’s bridesmaids which is the opera’s most famous number is actually omitted, presumably because it was felt to be reprehensibly patriarchal. The production takes place on an austere bare stage, without even a hint of the opera’s German-forest setting – apart from the inevitable use of back-projection to give us literal forest-scenes, which as always with back-projections absolutely fails to stimulate the imagination. If you really want to feel the thrill of Weber’s opera, put on the CD of the classic recording conducted by Erich Kleiber in 1955, sit back and close your eyes. It’s the only “Freischütz Project” you’ll ever need. The charmingly fresh-faced young Z.E.N. piano trio is made up of an American violinist, a Chinese pianist and an Armenian cellist, who came together in 2015 when they were members of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation Artist scheme. Their name is nothing to do with Buddhism, it’s simply a neat acronym of the first letters of their first names, and there’s nothing meditative about their new CD, a collection of four Russian pieces centred around Shostakovich’s great E minor Trio of 1944. It’s hard to overstate the tragic depth of this piece, which was inspired by the early death of Shostakovich’s great friend the musicologist and polymath Ivan Sollertinsky but was also overshadowed by the war. In the Finale there’s a tune of unmistakeably Jewish character which is hammered out in a frenzy, a musical image of despair which some say was inspired by the revelation that SS guards made Jewish prisoners dance next to their own graves. The combination of bleak ghostly lament and savage parody leads many trios to exaggerate the extremes, but that isn’t The Z.E.N. Trio’s way. They prefer a more traditionally musical approach, allowing space for those subtle variations in tempo and expressive mouldings of phrases which a performance pitched at a constant scream of maximum intensity can’t manage. On the whole tempos are faster than average, which makes the narrative of the Finale where all the previous movements pass by like a dream easier to grasp. Their performance is no less moving than more overtly tragic performances, and its only drawback is that here and there the pianist Zhang Zuo seems underpowered. Alongside Shostakovich's trio are two pieces, both beautifully played, which show a very different side of Soviet music. Arno Babadjanian’s piano trio of 1952 harks back to turn-of-the-century Russian romanticism, while the famous Sabre Dance from another Armenian composer, Aram Khachturian, is in the picturesque exotic vein of Soviet ballet. Next to these Rachmaninov’s gorgeously melancholic Vocalise of 1915, which rounds off the disc, doesn’t seem at all out of place. It’s an impressive release for a Trio which will surely go far. Some   of the podium can make do with directing just one of the world’s great orchestras. That’s not enough for the electrifying Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. He’s chief conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestras and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, and is now busy recording all fifteen symphonies of Shostakovich with the first, and all nine of Bruckner’s with the second. One hardly dares imagine the Air Miles he’s clocked up in the process. Some have made unflattering comparisons between the white-hot energy of the Shostakovich recordings and a certain over-relaxed quality of the Bruckner cycle. That’s certainly not my impression. The Bruckner recordings are among the best around, and this new one, a double-CD set of an early and late symphony along with the Prelude to Wagner's Meistersinger, is stunning. Bruckner’s early Second Symphony has all the hall-marks of the mature composer – lilting Viennese lyricism, spacious hymn-like melodies, and huge craggy pile-ups of brass fanfares and wheeling violin patterns suggestive of vast spaces. But the vision isn’t yet quite in focus. The patterns are often too four-square, and the big sections are set off so emphatically from each other that the music’s flow can easily become clogged. Not in this performance, where Nelsons seizes on every opportunity to relax the tempo or push it forward, which softens the edges of those granite-like blocks. And because the playing is so delicately shaded Bruckner’s rich rhythmic tangles in the second movement, where all the string parts move at a different speed, register with maximum clarity. In the much better-known and greater Eighth Symphony this rhythmic flexibility allows Nelsons to take some risks. “Solemnly, not dragging” is how Bruckner marks the second movement, and though Nelsons’s tempo is immensely slow the music never loses momentum. “Solemnly, not fast” is the marking in the Finale, but Nelsons actually takes it at a tremendous urgent pace, and by cleverly maintaining the urgency until the end – while making room for lovely lyrical digressions – he makes more sense of this huge puzzling movement than many performances I’ve heard. Wagner’s Meistersinger Prelude, like everything else on the disc, has a spacious glowing sound, with much fine-grained detail. In every way this recording is a winner. Aristocrat or bumpkin? Joseph Haydn seems to be both at once, which is a large part of his appeal. His music effortlessly straddles the class divide, just as it straddles any number of other opposites: high and low, serious and comic, transcendent and everyday. However this new recording of his radiant, wise and often mysterious set of six quartets Op 76 leans heavily towards the aristocratic. The excellent liner notes by Richard Wigmore talk constantly about the “rustic energy” of these pieces, particularly the dance movements which on the page can seem almost uncouth. But never on these recordings. Those minuets sidle into being with insinuating gracefulness, as if we’re in an aristocratic ballroom. It’s the same story in the spacious opening movements, the rapt hymn-like slow movements, and the helter-skelter finales. Everything sounds super-refined, partly because the players perform on 18th-century instruments, which make a lighter, more dancing sound. But this quartet sounds very different to other so-called “period quartets”. They tend to emphasise Haydn’s nervous energy and broad-brush humour. The London Haydn Quartet give those balanced phrases and sudden pauses a very different, tenderly expressive quality.   To achieve this the players make a much smoother sound. Not once do you hear the cheerful “bouncing bow” effect, which other period-instrument quartets use all the time. The players sometimes make a surprisingly romantic expressive droop or slide between notes, but it’s applied so fleetingly I wondered whether I was imagining it, and had to rewind the recording and re-listen just to be sure. It’s the same with vibrato, that expressive trembling quality which some period-instrument quartets banish altogether. On this recording it’s certainly there, but so subtly done I often couldn’t tell whether I was hearing vibrato or not. And in almost every bar the players pull the tempo back, or push it forward, or make the tiniest hesitation to emphasise an emphatic chord. Some listeners may miss the foot-stamping, peasant aspect of Haydn, and I did myself – for a while. But the mysterious, intimate side of these pieces burned more brightly, which more than made up for the loss. For most of the 172 years since his death, the great master of Italian early romantic opera Gaetano Donizetti was known only for a handful of masterpieces. Most of his 65 operas seemed condemned to permanent oblivion. But in recent decades many of these have been rescued, and some have turned out to be near masterpieces, almost on a par with the ones we know and love such as L’Elisir d’Amore and Lucia di Lammermoor. It’s fair to say Pietro il Grande (“Peter the Great”), a comic opera unveiled in Venice in 1820 when the composer was only 23, is not one of them. But as this DVD of the 2019 Donizetti Festival production reveals, it’s not negligible either. The master of lusciously ornate vocal melody we know from the mature operas is already fully formed, though the young Donizetti hadn’t yet found his wonderfully delicate touch as an orchestrator (and the rough-edged orchestral playing doesn’t show it off to best advantage).  But the overall Rossini-pastiche style of the opera is brilliantly done, and includes one “patter” duet that will leave you humming the tune for days. The story is every bit as silly as you’d expect. The Tsar and his wife are travelling incognito in search of his wife’s lost brother, and they pitch up in a village where a young carpenter is in love with a local belle who is pursued by a venal money-lender. Of course the carpenter turns out to be the long-lost brother, and before the inevitable happy ending there are plenty of comic imbroglios. The directing team from Ondadurto Teatro decided that a Russian-Suprematist-style production would be just the ticket for an opera set in Tsarist times, because after all the Tsar was very forward-looking. It’s one of those mad ideas that only an opera director would think of, and the costumes, which make everyone look like animated Suprematist paintings with a topping of 19th-century pomp, are eye-wateringly bad. But at least their riotous colourfulness is amusing, and the performances are equally over-the-top. Roberto de Candia as the Tsar is a weak link, but the light soprano of Nina Solodovnikova as the belle Annetta is charming. Marco Filippo Romano as the corrupt and lascivious magistrate is a treat, and there are nice cameos from Tommaso Barea as the money-lender and Stefano Gentili as the Notary. The other new Donizetti release is on an altogether different level. Premiered nine years after Pietro il Grande, Il Paria (“The Pariah”) is a tragedy about the horrors of racial and religious bigotry set in ancient India. A priestess of Brahma is in love with a military hero, who unfortunately turns out to be the son of a Pariah.  The truth is revealed at the end, and priestess, hero and the outcast father all die together, at the hand of the enraged Brahmin priests – but not before the Pariah prophesises that their laws “will be destroyed by the people of a later age”, a remarkably modern-sounding sentiment. By now Donizetti is leaving the Rossinian tradition behind and moving towards the more dramatic, continuous style of Verdi. The clash between the iron laws of duty and romantic ardour is a very Verdian theme, and there are some astonishing anticipations of Verdi’s dramatic use of harmony and colourful orchestration. So it’s a superior piece, but the care and attention to detail lavished on the recording lifts it still higher. Opera Rara is dedicated to rescuing little-known romantic operas from oblivion, and for this recording they’ve actually gone to the trouble of commissioning a new error-free edition of the music from leading Italian opera scholars. The soloists have been chosen with equal care. Donizetti wrote one of his most perilously high and athletic tenor parts for the hero Idamore, and you have to marvel at the way René Barbera tackles this high-wire act. Marko Mimica is superb as the unflinchingly vicious high priest Akebare, and Misha Kiria as Idamore’s father Zarete seems at first to be equally iron and unbending, though eventually he’s touched with a redeeming humanity. Soaring over them all, literally and metaphorically, is the tenderly flexible soprano of Albina Shagimuratova. She melts the heart of the listener as the high priestess Neala, but not alas the fiercely patriarchal culture around her. Helping the vocal soloists to shine is the intelligent and tautly disciplined playing from the Britten Sinfonia under Mark Elder, and the ardent singing of the Opera Rara Chorus. In all it’s a marvel; let’s hope it encourages an enterprising opera company to bring the piece to the stage. Musical celebrations at Versailles in the reign of Louis XIV were normally on a grand scale, as befitted the most powerful monarch in Europe. But by the end of his life Louis was getting weary of the pompous ceremonial which surrounded every aspect of his life. Le Grand Coucher – the Grand Going to Bed – was giving way to the Petit Coucher, a less onerously formal affair. Thanks to a particularly assiduous court musician named Philidor, the archives at Versailles contain a treasury of small-scale, intimate music which he copied out for these bed-time musical entertainments. Many of them are arrangements of pieces which began life on a much bigger scale somewhere else, as a ballet or dramatic scene. Using this archive, French lutenist Thibaut Roussel has gathered together a group of ten excellent young players and two singers to create an imaginary Petit Coucher on an evening in early 1713. To appreciate the seductive flavour of this disc it’s probably best until wait until bed-time, and have a hot toddy to hand. That will help you savour the strange, melancholy atmosphere of this music, designed for rooms with heavy curtains and tapestries where the sun rarely penetrates. The procession of grave pieces for the deep bass lute, beautifully played by Roussel, are interwoven with equally grave Plaintes (laments) or Preludes for a bigger but still intimate group of flutes, violin, bass viols and harpsichord. Every now and then there’s a welcome injection of energy from a suite of dances, but it doesn’t last. Mingled in with the instrumental pieces are four vocal numbers, including an amorous duet for Cleopatra and Mark Anthony sung with a perfect sense of style by mezzo-soprano Danaé Monnié and baritone Marc Mauillon (though Monnié’s vocal sound is much more tender and winning). Along with the CD there’s a DVD of the group performing in the beautiful Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, which is a treat in itself. It can’t be denied there’s a certain sameness of mood, but the mood is so extraordinary and the sounds so delicious you won’t mind. “Heavenly length” is a description often applied to Schubert’s generous musical forms, which roam through distant harmonies with leisurely ease as if the music has all the time in the world. It’s a phrase that’s apt for the two chamber pieces on a new recording released by Naxos, especially the late Piano Trio, which despite its slender forces is a big beast: the final movement is over 20 minutes long. In some performances that luxurious length, combined with the assertive, thick piano texture, can weigh heavy on the ear. That never happens in these new recordings, partly because the players perform on old instruments appropriate to the period. The Arpeggione sonata was originally written for a bowed guitar, a newly-invented instrument which enjoyed a brief vogue in Schubert’s Vienna and was later dubbed ""arpeggione"".  We normally hear it on the cello, but here Alexander Rudin performs it on an arpeggione, which is a revelation. It has a winningly transparent sound, and Schubert’s frequent ascents to the high register which can sound strenuous on a cello seem easy and natural on this instrument. Rudin’s accompanist Aapo Häkkinen plays on an early 19 -century piano that’s exactly right for the music. The delightful silvery slenderness of the fortepiano’s sound means the balance problems that often afflict this piece and the Trio simply melt away. However just as you shouldn’t blame the tools when a workman does a bad job, you shouldn’t praise them either when things turn out superbly. Aapo Häkkinen is simply a wonderful musician, who would surely sound great on a pub honky-tonk piano. He has a charming way of softening the edges of Schubert’s score with an almost improvisatory freedom, often rolling chords that most pianists play ""straight"". Alexander Rudin and violinist Erich Höbart make a sound that’s robust without ever being heavy, and all three together infuse the music with a subtle rhythmic freedom, so Schubert’s frequent repetitions never sound exactly the same. “Heavenly length,” indeed.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/best-classical-music-reviews-2021-cds-albums-dvds/

Originally due to run in April 2020, this revival of the big-haired and big-hearted Sixties-set musical finally hits the stage this summer. Michael Ball is reprising his Olivier Award-winning turn as Edna Turnblad, and Paul Merton makes his West End debut as husband Wilbur. Sir Ian McKellen plays Shakespeare's prince, 50 years after he first tackled the role, and then Firs in Chekhov's Cherry Orchard, as part of a company staging both productions back to back. Also joining him are Steven Berkoff, Jenny Seagrove and Francesca Annis, directed by Sian Mathias. Beware the Trunchbull - one of the most terrifying villains in all of children’s literature. Thankfully, she has a hero to match in the form of the imaginative and magical Matilda. This RSC production captures Roald Dahl’s anarchic spirit, particularly via Tim Minchin’s mischievous songs. Mark Goucher Productions has announced two musical tours beginning in the summer. Hairspray begins in Plymouth on June 24, while Priscilla - which paused mid-run in 2020, and is co-produced by Jason Donovan - picks up its run in Cheltenham on June 23, and is aiming for a West End return.  Book for Hairspray   and Priscilla  The verdant north London venue, which managed a   of Jesus Christ Superstar last summer, is back with a full season. First up, Kimberley Sykes directs Shakespeare’s tragedy of star-crossed lovers (June 26-July 24), and then Timothy Sheader helms Rodgers and Hammerstein’s iconic musical, with choreography from Drew McOnie (July 30-September 18). There’s also Derek Bond’s interactive Dragons and Mythical Beasts for youngsters (August 10-September 5). The stage musical version of the DreamWorks animated movie features fresh songs from Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz, along with his enduring anthem When You Believe. This epic production charts Moses’ journey to free the Israelites in Ancient Egypt, while battling his adopted brother Ramses, the Pharaoh.  This family-favourite musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was revived in 2019, and - though delayed a year - Laurence Connor’s lively, contemporary production now gets a well-deserved encore run. Jac Yarrow reprises his performance in the lead role of Joseph, and Jason Donovan also returns as the Elvis-styled Pharaoh.  Previously due to run in 2020, this Nottingham Playhouse/Leeds Playhouse co-production of Pam Gems’ drama tells the extraordinary story of the world-renowned chanteuse, who went from singing on the streets to hits like La Vie en Rose and Je Ne Regrette Rien. Jenna Russell stars as Piaf, and the theatre will be transformed into a Parisian bar with cabaret-style seating. Rodgers and Hammerstein’s stirring musical is set on an archipelago in 1943, and features romance, espionage and racial prejudice - plus great songs like I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair, Some Enchanted Evening and There Is Nothing Like a Dame. Daniel Evans directs, and tickets are on general sale soon. The faithful stage musical version of the Julia Roberts/Richard Gere romcom is back in the West End, though transferring from the Piccadilly to the Savoy Theatre. The cast features Aimie Atkinson, Danny Mac and Rachel Wooding, with music from Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. The raucous religious satire from South Park’s Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and Frozen’s  , is still one of the most provocative shows in the West End. It follows two mismatched Mormon missionaries who travel to Uganda in hopes of preaching to the inhabitants of a remote village, only to come up against a local warlord. Mischief are taking three of their hit slapstick comedy shows out on the road, including the first run of Magic Goes Wrong, their collaboration with Penn & Teller, outside of London. That one begins at Leicester Curve on July 16, while The Play That Goes Wrong opens at Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury on July 13, and Groan Ups at Theatre Royal Bath on August 12. The Secret Cinema organisation has   recently, first for its sizable chunk of the Culture Recovery Fund, and then again for commandeering a local park. Will its riff on the beloved Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey film be enough to silence detractors? You can carry your watermelon to the event this summer and find out. Andrew Lloyd Webber has led the charge on getting theatres back in action, and he’s putting his money where his mouth is with this new musical take on the classic fairy tale, starring Carrie Hope Fletcher. It promises to be a spikier version, thanks to a book from  ’s Emerald Fennell, and the Lord has already teased audiences by releasing some of the songs. The stage adaptation of David Walliams' hit children's book should prove a family favourite this summer.  It tells the story of Joe Spud, the richest boy in the country, who has everything money can buy, except a friend. The Birmingham Stage Company production comes to the West End following a UK tour. The continuation of JK Rowling’s book series is a theatrical triumph, using astonishing illusions, movement, lighting and props to conjure up her magical world. But this two-part production, directed by John Tiffany and scripted by Jack Thorne, pays just as much attention to characters and their relationships, giving audiences an engrossing - and moving - story. Lloyd Webber is also responsible for the return of the Phantom, along with a refurbished theatre and revamped production. Killian Donnelly plays the (aptly) masked man who dwells beneath the Paris Opera House and mentors the beautiful soprano Christine in secret, seducing her with his “music of the night”. Will & Grace star Megan Mullally makes her West End debut opposite Robert Lindsay in this classic Cole Porter/P. G. Wodehouse musical, which takes place on board a luxury ocean liner. Featuring romance, comic hijinks, dancing sailors and great standards like It’s De-Lovely, You’re the Top and I Get a Kick Out of You, it’s gold-plated escapism. The popular jukebox musical, which follows the turbulent journey of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons - from hit songs to band infighting and troubles with the mob - is back in the West End. The musical will open the revamped Trafalgar Theatre, which has been returned to its original heritage design with just one, larger auditorium. Julie Taymor’s inspired, child-friendly stage version of the Disney animated film returns. This creative production uses epic puppetry and special effects to evoke the African Pridelands. Add in catchy Elton John and Tim Rice songs like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and it’s one parents can enjoy too. This glorious theatrical adaptation of the MGM Golden Age movie is back, along with former Royal Ballet principal Adam Cooper in the Gene Kelly role. A loving spoof of 1920s Hollywood being rocked by the “talkies”, it’s packed with great numbers - including that title song, accompanied by 14,000 litres of water splashed on stage every night. The Hope Mill was only able to stage five performances of Rent last autumn before lockdown struck, although the production was  . But a full theatrical run is very welcome, giving disappointed audiences another chance to see Jonathan Larson's beloved musical live and in person. Luke Shepperd directs. The stage version of the iconic sci-fi adventure movie – which sees cool 80s teenager Marty McFly transported back to 1955 via Doc Brown's time-travelling DeLorean, where he must ensure his parents fall in love – opened in Manchester in March 2020, and now gets its belated West End transfer. Expect futuristic special effects and rock 'n' roll. The long-awaited UK premiere of the Disney stage extravaganza will finally arrive in August, so get ready to build a snowman and “Let It Go”. Samantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon star as Princesses Elsa and Anna respectively. Existing ticket-holders will receive a new booking date, and tickets go back on general sale on April 15. One of the   announced for 2021 is this adaptation of Helen Forrester’s autobiography, about moving to Liverpool in the 1930s after her father went bankrupt and having to fight for her independence. All being well, it will begin at the Lowther Pavilion in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, in September and then play at 18 theatres in different towns and cities. It might seem like an impossible tale to adapt for stage, but the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield used ingenious theatrical tricks and state-of-the-art visuals to conjure a boy trapped in a lifeboat with a Royal Bengal tiger. Now, this dramatisation of Yann Martel’s Man Booker Prize-winning novel comes to the West End. Shakespeare meets 90s pop hits in this irresistible show, which allows Juliet to escape her tragic fate and embark on a new adventure instead. The score takes its songs from the stupendous back catalogue of songwriter Max Martin, who created hits for the likes of Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. One of the great losses of the 2020 theatre programme was the thrilling prospect of Cush Jumbo playing Hamlet. Happily, the London venue has announced that the show is back on for this autumn, with the busy actress – who played Mark Anthony in the Donmar's all-female Julius Caesar – directed by her long-time collaborator Greg Hersov. This world premiere tells the story of the Jamaican superstar, honouring not just his enduring songs - like No Woman, No Cry, I Shot the Sheriff, and One Love - but also his social and political advocacy. Lee Hall has written the book, Clint Dyer directs, and Arinzé Kene plays Bob Marley. The National Theatre’s sold-out stage adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel gets a West End encore. This spellbinding tale features a man returning to his home town for a funeral, which sparks memories of an invasive supernatural being and the magical family who helped him to battle it. The imaginative production features skilful puppetry and illusions.  Beverley Knight stars as pioneering music manager Faye Treadwell, who led The Drifters to global fame - while battling prejudice within the industry. This new musical will feature numerous hits, such as Kissin’ in the Back Row of the Movies, and also give long-overdue attention to a legendary figure.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/best-theatre-book-tickets-2021-london-uk/
127,"Kaleidoscope’s young blood is a little too cool, plus the best of March’s classical concerts","While other venues sputter like damp fireworks, Wigmore Hall keeps going, bringing us top-level music-making day after day. Sometimes they even offer two concerts in a single day, which was normal back in “normal” times, but now seems like almost reckless profusion. Yesterday was one such cornucopia. In the evening, tenor Ian Bostridge and pianist Julius Drake performed Schubert, Debussy and Fauré; but first, at lunchtime, we heard four members of the recently formed chamber group Kaleidoscope, now an “associate ensemble” of the hall. They offered an all-French programme that reversed the normal order of a menu, going from feather-light trifle to meaty masterpiece. The trifle came from Melanie Bonis, one of those doughty 19th-century female composers who managed to make it in an almost exclusively male world. She’s now being rediscovered, but one has to hope there are stronger pieces among her 300 works than the two-movement Soir Matin (Evening Morning) we heard yesterday. In this performance the opening movement came across as gently beautiful – frankly, a bit too gentle. Perhaps if the playing had been more full-blooded, this collection of musical swags and furbelows might have been more engaging. The performers’ sweetly gentle approach was right for the more engaging Matin, which was interestingly troubled: more grey clouds than radiant new dawn. That slightly lop-sided emphasis on the intimate and gentle was evident in the performance of the Second Piano Quartet by Gabriel Fauré, which rounded off the concert. It’s true that much of the music inhabits a sweetly intimate world – the composer Aaron Copland described it admiringly as “a long sigh of infinite tenderness” – but that’s not the half of it. There’s real unruly passion under the soft outlines of the music, which didn’t always shine through in this performance. The second movement should burst with frustrated fury, but pianist Tom Poster softened the angry left-hand figure with a touch of pedal, and the plucked chords from the three string players were more polite than savage. Still, the tender moments were indeed tender, especially those in which violinist Elena Urioste’s drooping phrases were echoed by cellist Colin Carr, though the plaintive responses of violist Rosalind Ventris – the echoes finding their own echo, as it were – were actually the most affecting of all. In between the two billowing romantic effusions of Bonis and Fauré came the stark and stony D’un Soir Triste (A Sad Evening) by Lili Boulanger. Thanks to the recent revival of her music, it’s become clear that the early death at 24 of this slender, always-sickly woman was the most grievous loss in 20th-century music. This extraordinary piece, written in the shadow of the First World War, seems to come from some desolate, blasted region too dreadful even for sorrow – a quality the performers caught and held with just the right halting, stunned eloquence. You know you’re in for a good evening when the performers are visibly enjoying themselves. Pleasure in co-ordinated action always enlivens the sound as well as the look of a concert, and it gives an extra warmth to the music’s emotional qualities. That was certainly the case at this terrific Scottish Chamber Orchestra concert, which was curated and compèred by Louise Goodwin, one of the orchestra’s percussionists, filmed in Perth Concert Hall and now is streaming online. Goodwin came up with a short vivid programme that put Baroque and American minimalist composers together, so we could enjoy the shared obsession with repeating patterns and rhythmic energy. It’s a common enough conceit, but it worked especially well here, as the contrasts in emotional weight and sound were huge. Henry Purcell’s Chacony in G minor and D major Fantasia bookended the concert in a dancing mood, the intertwined lines in the two violins and viola nicely poised over the driving double-bass, cello and harpsichord. There was a different sort of poise in Steve Reich’s Nagoya Marimbas, more aloof and detached but with a suppressed joy, well caught in this performance from Goodwin and her fellow marimba player Rich Cartlidge. Then came the concert’s rapt still centre, in the shape of Fratres, the oft-played masterpiece by the Estonian so-called “holy minimalist” Arvo Pärt, played here in an arrangement for string quartet and two percussionists. Over a never-changing drone on viola, a patiently circling melody, intoned by the other three string players with exquisite softness, slowly gained weight as it descended. Between each descent, the two percussionists tapped out a rhythm in chipped wooden sounds and muffled bass drum that was tiny yet monumental. It was like some inscrutable ritual purged of human feeling, yet moving nevertheless. In this exalted company, the concert’s most recent piece, Dani Howard’s Shades, felt distinctly thin. The idea of a vibraphone solo in dialogue with its own “virtual” shadow – generated by a foot-pedal attached to a computer – produced some promising moments, and Goodwin relished the concert’s only opportunity for some tempo flexibility and expressive playing. But it felt like a sketch for something that needed to be bigger. This and everything else was blown away by Workers Union, a pungent piece of musical protest from the 1970s. Freedom through unity was a common slogan in those days, and the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen caught the idea brilliantly. It’s a piece for any number of players on loud instruments, all hammering away at driving syncopated rhythms in perfect co-ordination, but each left free to choose their own notes. It’s a piece I always imagined needed the brute physical impact of saxophones and brass played at ear-splitting volume, and the idea of transferring it to the polite Baroque-ish ensemble of strings and harpsichord seemed risky. In fact, it was wonderful. Andriessen once said Workers Union needed to sound aggressive, but he was wrong: it just needs to be joyous and superlatively well-drilled, and the music will seem triumphant – as it did here. Opera has not been an entirely closed book during lockdown, but sheer expense has proved a disincentive to the staging of full-dress filmed productions, of the kind recently mounted by some well-heeled European houses. Faced with this challenge, a few British counterparts have boldly repurposed themselves. English National Opera’s ENO Breathe workshops, for instance, put the expertise of its singers at the service of “long Covid” sufferers, helping them to harness the power of deep breathing and singing. For Opera North, instead of the audience going to the company, the company goes to the audience. Its ONe-to-ONe scheme offers short solo performances to patrons for free, given via Zoom by members of the orchestra and chorus. Unsurprisingly, it has caught on like wildfire. The first batch of 96 10-minute slots were snapped up within an hour. It’s a lucky dip: you might be offered a poetry reading, an instrumental recital or an aria. I logged on at the appointed time, and was faced with the cheerfully smiling face of Katie Walker, a mezzo-soprano in the chorus. There was a moment’s awkwardness on my part. How do you face a skilled performer who’s about to give a performance just for your benefit? I felt like some  king. But not for long, as Walker soon launched into one of my favourite arias, the impassioned Amour! viens aider ma faiblesse! (Love, come to the aid of my weakness!) from Camille Saint-Saëns’s Samson and Delilah. She performed with the aid of a pre-recorded orchestral background, and sang with such full-blooded passion that I felt I ought to stand to attention (or at least put down my coffee mug). Afterwards, I asked her how she finds these solo performances. “I love them,” she said simply. “It’s a way of actually meeting our audiences and finding out what they like.” My second slot, from orchestral leader David Creed, was just as enjoyable. He played a movement from Bach’s A minor Partita with engagingly forthright severity. And not all ONe-to-ONe performances are in fact one-to-one. I eavesdropped on a slightly longer performance for a Leeds care-home – given, again, by the indefatigable Walker. She sang Seguidilla from Carmen, a number from Kiss Me Kate and a tear-jerking Edwardian ballad, I’ll Walk Beside You. As far as I could judge, it went down a storm. Thus far there have been 162 performances, with more to come, and they’re sold out into April. In their modesty and intimacy, they’re as far from the grandeur of “normal” opera as you could imagine, and they must have carried the name of Opera North into places it has never reached before. That’s certainly a silver lining for the company, in these dark and difficult times. As this live-streamed concert reminded us, even the best-laid plans can be derailed by the pandemic. The LSO’s music director Sir Simon Rattle had invited star Canadian soprano Barbara Hannigan to sing two great 20th-century works with the orchestra, the rapturously nostalgic Knoxville: Summer of 1915 by Samuel Barber, and Edgard Varèse’s sultrily sinister Offrandes (Offerings). Both had to quarantine, as they were travelling from abroad – then, with rehearsals well under way, the test and trace system removed Rattle from the picture. It seemed as if a deputy conductor would have to be called in. Hannigan, however, had other ideas. She pursues a parallel career as a conductor, so why couldn’t she conduct Barber’s piece herself, as well as sing it? This wouldn’t be unprecedented for her, but to my knowledge she’s a unique case, for obvious reasons. The two roles of performing and conducting are often combined by concerto soloists; it was the norm in the 18th century. But there’s something about the physicality of singing that makes simultaneous conducting inconceivable – or so it seemed, until Hannigan came along. She had precisely 24 hours to prepare, and being a brilliant musician, pulled it off. To ask whether this also resulted in a moving performance might seem unfair. But, in truth, it didn’t quite come off. Hannigan was, as ever, elegantly unflappable and technically impeccable, soaring up to pianissimo top notes while cueing the clarinets with one hand and maintaining a pulse with the other. But expressively she seemed somewhat out-of-focus. Barber’s piece sets a rhapsodic prose poem by James Agee, in which the author looks back from regretful adulthood to his six-year-old self, who gazes up at the stars on a warm night while enjoying the cosy sound of adult voices murmuring in the dark. The piece emerges from deep peace and returns to it – yet Hannigan launched off in an anxiously tremulous manner. This meant that later, when the music became genuinely anguished, she had less room for manoeuvre. Rattle had in fact been released from quarantine in the nick of time, and he could have taken over, but he agreed to let Hannigan conduct anyway. This was gallant, but didn’t lead to the best musical result. Later in the evening, by contrast, for the performance of Varèse’s Offrandes, Hannigan was able to leave the orchestra in Rattle’s hands, and the results were superb. Varèse set two surrealist poems that evoke visions of ancient tropical deities, and Rattle and the LSO gave the opening just the right throaty primeval-swamp quality. Hannigan’s voice seemed to tip-toe amongst the fetid ticking and scraping of the percussion and the abrupt menace of the muted brass, and only at the end did the suppressed panic finally break out. We stayed with ancient pagan deities for The Song of Quetzalcoatl by Lou Harrison, that Californian devotee of all things far-away and ancient. Its austere rhythmic patterns, pattered out with unflappable control by four percussionists, were as aloof as Varèse’s piece was sinister. Finally, to banish these disquieting visions, came the rarely-performed complete ballet score of Ravel’s Ma mère l’Oye (Mother Goose). The sumptuous orchestral sound, garlanded with exquisite solo playing from oboist Juliana Koch, leader Roman Simović and others, wrapped us in nostalgia, and the closing tableau, Le jardin féerique (Fairy Garden), conducted by Rattle at a luxuriantly slow pace, glittered and shone like a vision of bliss. Mozart’s final opera, inspired by the jealousies and murderous intrigues around the nobly forgiving Roman emperor Titus Vespasian, can be a magnificent spectacle. All those processions of senators and noble ladies in their pomp, with the Forum in the background. At the climax of the first Act one of the conspirators actually burns down the Capitol, which is a chance for a properly picturesque apocalypse.   But not here. Spectacle and pyrotechnics are in distinctly short supply in Bergen National Opera’s new production. Originally due to be staged last March and then cancelled because of the pandemic, the production took place, as ever, at the Grieg Hall, where it was rethought from scratch to take account of social distancing rules on stage. When restrictions on travel became even more severe, a number of international singers had to be stood down and replaced with Norwegians, one or two of whom had to learn their parts in less than a fortnight. The London-based production team led by director Rodula Gaitanou had to work remotely, giving directions via computer screens. Frankly it’s a miracle the production took place at all, and certainly the difficult conditions have left their mark. In terms of mise-en-scène the black backdrop and black featureless stage seem at first just too austere to fire the imagination. The six characters in designer Cordelia Chisholm’s grey business suits are often seen at a row of desks at the back, suggesting that, when not maddened by jealous passion, they’re just a bunch of Imperial bureaucrats. When they are thus maddened, they dash forward and move in attitudes of fury or anguish between five well-spaced illuminated squares, as if to suggest the intrigues between them are like moves on a chess-board. This is a nice conceit, though why it had to be enacted quite so austerely is a mystery; surely a bit of colour would have helped. And giving Tito a chain of office like those worn by Lord Mayors wasn’t a good move. Combined with his perpetually worried look it made it seem as if he’d just been heckled at the opening of a new bus depot. Yet somehow the performance rose above the conceit and took wing. Things got off to the best possible start with the overture, performed by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra under their chief conductor Edward Gardner with startling energy. Then, before we had a chance to take a breath, on came soprano Beate Mordal in a sexy white trouser suit. She plays the nastiest of the conspirators Vitellia, spitting fury and impressive vocal pyrotechnics because Tito—whom she’d had her eye on—wants to marry a Jewish princess. She’s followed by her besotted admirer Sesto played by Adrian Angelico, who agrees reluctantly to be the assassin. And so the conspiracy takes shape.  Among the other roles, Ingeborg Gillebo as Sesto’s well-meaning friend Annio and Frøy Hovland Holtbakk as his sister Servilia are both equally vivid. Bror Magnus Tødenes seems under strain vocally as Tito, but he movingly conveys the anguish of the twice-betrayed Emperor.  But the real star of the show is the orchestra, above all the player on the basset horn whose sound rapturously entwines with the singers in the opera’s most beautiful arias. At the end, when all are forgiven and the terrific chorus and orchestra fling out the final chorus, the stage is flooded with light—suggesting that Tito is actually an Enlightenment monarch born ahead of time. Greyness gives way to radiance, a transformation we could all wish for at this moment. The vocal group Voces8 inspires awe. As well as singing like angels they run an educational foundation and their own venue, and throughout the lockdown they’ve offered filmed festivals of choral and other music which for production values and musical quality are second to none. Last night’s concert, the seventh in their Spring Festival, was conceived and led by none other than Dame Emma Kirkby. To call her the doyenne of British singers of the so-called “early” music would be no more than the simple truth. The pearly radiant tones of that voice, and Kirkby’s winning way with the words of old Italian and English texts made her for a while the best-selling British classical artist in Europe. But she’s so much more than that. She has an interest in song from every country and era, as this concert proved. And doyenne in any case seems the wrong word. It implies an aristocratic, haughty mastery, whereas Kirkby has the eagerness and vulnerable expressivity of a young singer, as she showed time and again. Some doyennes have capacious egos too, but at this concert from “Dame Emma Kirkby and Friends” the Dame refused to hog the show. The idea of a concert for Mothering Sunday devoted to songs about maternity from the 12th to the 21st century was entirely hers, but she ceded most of the limelight to her fine bunch of young singers and instrumentalists. Among them were lutenist Toby Carr and harpist Aileen Henry, agile and sensitive accompanists in Italian songs devoted to the Virgin. There was fine pianist Christopher Glynn, who accompanied Dame Emma in one of the more innocent songs from Paul Hindemith’s Das Marienleben (the Life of Mary). There was multi-instrumentalist Matt Redman, whose strumming guitar and banjo ushered us into the world of songs about motherhood from the Civil War and First World War, when anti-war protest was joined to a note of stoical grieving. Sharing the songs with Dame Emma were two mezzo-sopranos who were tellingly contrasted with her and each other. Patricia Hammond had the softer more cushioned voice of the two, and the combination of her caressing tone with soft-edged harmonium and piano in a movement from the Stabat Mater by Clémence de Granval—a little-known but clearly wonderful 19th-century Parisian composer—was the most deliciously tender moment of the evening. Helen Charleston had a darker sound, with a sharper expressive edge. She was spellbinding in Tarquinio Merula’s long lullaby sung by the Virgin to her child, rising to muted climaxes of sadness as she foresees the life that lies ahead of him. Dame Emma, not to be outdone, reminded us how well she communicates aspiration and fervour in Barbara Strozzi’s wonderful Hymn to the Virgin. The most radiantly beautiful moment of the evening actually came at the beginning, when all three singers joined in Hildegard of Bingen’s song in praise of the Virgin. The three voices rose and fell in waves of melody, so rhapsodic and free and weightless it felt as if it could continue for eternity. All praise to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for continuing with their streamed concert series. We’ve missed the galvanising presence of their chief conductor, Kirill Karabits, but they’ve had a range of interesting guest conductors and soloists, including John Eliot Gardiner and Stephen Hough, who together gave a terrific performance of Brahms’s First Piano Concerto. Last night it was the turn of 32-year-old Polish conductor Marta Gardolińska, who led a programme of two crisp, classically-proportioned symphonies, separated by a delicious slice of Russian late-romanticism. Gardolińska was an athlete in a previous life, and she brought an invigorating light touch to Schubert’s symphony and an exact sense of tempo proportions, finding precisely the contrasting tempo for the swaying, bucolic middle section of the hearty third movement. Alas, the players were not as nimble as she. Every orchestra must be allowed the occasional off-night, and this was the clearly the BSO’s. The string ensemble was particularly patchy, especially in the finale – though here I sensed that Gardolińska was forcing the pace to a point where the music would have lost its smile anyway. The six minutes of rustling, undulating stillness that was Anatol Liadov’s The Enchanted Lake came as a welcome moment of summery charm. Liadov’s chief claim to fame was that he failed to deliver the music for Diaghilev’s ballet The Firebird, giving a break to a composer of whom no-one had heard – Igor Stravinsky. The Bournemouth SO’s playing here came into focus, and the music positively glowed. The interesting thing is that Liadov’s dreamy waterscape sounded very like some of the more enchanted moments in Stravinsky’s score. Sometimes the gap between talent and genius is not so great.   These two pieces were, in their different days, completely open and straightforward, with no dark corners or puzzling moments. By contrast, the final piece of the evening, Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony, consists of nothing but puzzling moments. It was composed just after the end of the Second World War, so everyone was expecting Shostakovich to deliver a properly weighty and triumphant utterance. What they got was something which launched off in a scandalously perky mood. Gardolińska was determined to play up to that, with a jauntily fast tempo and ear-rasping trombone and piccolo. Then came one of Shostakovich’s typically abrupt emotional switch-backs, with a long lament for two clarinets which – in this performance at least – emerged as dignified and objective, rather than heart-rending. The third movement took us back to the jollity of the opening movement, but now with a sharp and sardonic edge, emanating mostly from the superbly brazen sound of the orchestra’s principal trumpeter, Chris Avison. Gardolińska seemed to be taking us on a journey of ever-increasing polar opposites, through the doleful tuba and bassoon of the fourth movement, and onto the manic rush to the end. It was a convincing view of this puzzling piece, and a brilliantly exciting end to a concert which had more than its share of slip-ups along the way.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/review-top-best-classical-concerts-opera-march-2021/
128,The Mash Report's Nish Kumar says he would not host a political comedy show on the BBC again,"Left-wing comedian Nish Kumar has said that he won’t host a political comedy show for the BBC again, because the corporation didn’t “back” him when cancelling The Mash Report, which he hosted. The show, which regularly mocked and criticised the Conservative government and Brexit, was axed in March following BBC director-general Tim Davie beginning  in the corporation’s output. The BBC said   for new comedy shows”. When asked if he’d host another political comedy show for the BBC, Kumar told the New York Times: “I would think in a way 'what’s the point'? ""Why would I put myself back in that position if, when push comes to it, they’re not going to back me?” The Mash Report, which also featured comedian Rachel Parris, was widely perceived to have been axed due to its alleged left-wing bias. Broadcaster Andrew Neil called the show “self-satisfied, self-adulatory,  ”. Last year Kumar said he didn’t criticise Labour Party politicians as much as Conservatives on the show because, “The news is being very tough on those people anyway. ""I’m not sure those people need to be further beat up. They’re getting their beat-downs from election results.” Kumar said he was still a “fierce advocate” of the BBC. He challenged the corporation to make a public statement about whether The Mash Report’s cancellation was due to his and the show’s political leanings. He said he’d already privately asked the BBC if this was the case, but had not yet received a reply. The Telegraph has asked the BBC for comment. “I want the BBC to clarify it, not for my sake, either way, I’m getting fired,” Kumar said. “But for the health of the corporation. They need to make a definitive statement that it was not a political decision. Because what precedent does that set otherwise?”  ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/left-wing-comedian-says-would-not-host-political-comedy-show/

Ally Wolf, manager of Clapham Grand and festival director of Mighty Hoopla, notes that we’re all – organisers and attendees alike – awaiting detailed guidance from the Government on what measures will be necessary to reopen big events. Will that involve vaccine certificates, testing, masks, sanitiser – or all, or none? If the vaccine rollout goes as planned, will festivals be back to ‘normal’? Earlier this year, Wolf made the decision to move Hoopla back from June to September, and feels confident that “it’s a realistic target.” He’s expecting to reopen Clapham Grand with social distancing initially, but isn’t sure how that would be possible at a festival. “Maybe we lower capacity to allow more space? But it’s very different to a seated event.” He thinks the main thing will be ensuring plenty of space around the entrance to a festival, so that “you can do temperature checks or lateral flow tests, or check vaccine certificates – whatever it winds up being – without causing a problem for the local area.” There may still be some optional measures like providing hand sanitiser at festivals, he suggests, depending on current health advice.  But he’s certain that it will all be possible. “This is what we do! We organise large-scale events with customer safety integral to our planning, and without ruining the fun experience.” The main message he wants to share is that customers can now book with confidence and “look forward to having an amazing time.” Glastonbury is the big name absent from this year’s line-up, although founder Michael Eavis recently told LBC that he was considering staging a much smaller event in the autumn – “around the anniversary date of when we started, which was September 18, 1970.” There is also a live-streamed edition on May 22, featuring Coldplay, Damon Albarn and Haim. Download Festival was originally planned for June 4-6, which is too early according to the roadmap plan. Organisers have now confirmed it will be cancelled for the second year running. ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/uk-music-festivals-2021-dates-line-up-buy-tickets-covid-tips/
130,Is this the most politically correct sitcom on TV – or the most offensive?,"People are angry at Chuck Lorre. And for once it has nothing to do with  . Lorre’s cheesy nerd “comedy” – the humour was an acquired taste in the way a hernia is an acquired taste –  had half the world in hackles for a decade. But network television’s most powerful producer has moved on – to offending social media via an upcoming sitcom about the experiences of Afghan interpreters who have relocated to the United States.  Diversity, the fall-out from America’s long war in the Middle East, charges of cultural appropriation and gags courtesy of the guy who made  the best paid man on TV (with Two and a Half Men)…It was always going to be an unstable concoction. Just how unstable was made horribly clear when the trailer for the United States of Al debuted on CBS at the weekend.  “White saviour,” said some on Twitter after the preview of the show showed an “Afghan” character who has relocated to the US under Washington’s Special Immigrant Visa programme (SIV) and is living with a white US marine. “To see an American soldier hosting an Afghan [war interpreter] in the US and letting him live with his family does romanticise forces which killed, tortured, and unlawfully imprisoned thousands of Afghan civilians,” added another commentator. “Very disappointing from you.” Other criticisms centred on the fact that the lead character of Awalmir – “Al” – is played by Adhir Kalyan, who is of South Asian descent and was born in South Africa. “Finally, a groundbreaking show that will help Americans understand the plight of Indian actors playing magical Afghans to hunky gentle white supermodel saviours who are “tired from war because there is so much walking”,” activist Rafael Shimunov tweeted. And yet to paint Lorre as a perpetrator of the white saviour myth and eraser of cultural identity is arguably wide of the mark. The Big Bang Theory gave a starring role to Indian-American actor Kunal Nayyar – making it 1,000 per cent more diverse than Friends, Alan Partridge, Ricky Gervais’s The Office combined. Lorre, moreover, went out of his way to recruit a writer with a Nigerian background for his CBS show, Bob Hearts Abishola. He cold-called and hired Nigerian-British writer and comedian Gina Yashere after seeing her on YouTube –giving her the sort of opportunity she had never been afforded in the UK.  “So, originally, I was brought on as a consultant on all things African. It sounded weird to me,” Yashere told Insider, recounting her first meeting with Lorre. “Once I got in the room with the guys, I began to really like them. I could see that they were trying to make a really good show, and it wasn't really an exploitative thing.” He has also confronted the entrenched ageism of Hollywood with his Netflix hit the Kominsky Method, starring septuagenarians Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin.  And he has been one of the few senior executives in network TV to speak out about the importance of representation and of bringing a perspective to comedy that goes beyond the traditional white one. You can argue he has done so in incredibly broad and creaky fashion. But it is difficult to question his good intentions.  “You recognise your own blind spots, if you’re paying attention. You recognise your inclination is to surround yourself with more of you — people that reflect you and reflect your background. And that in and of itself is destructive and you don’t recognise it until you’re shown an alternative way of doing things,” is how Lorre outlined his philosophy towards representation in an interview with the LA Times last year.  “So it’s still a learning process. I’ve not stopped learning how to do this and not just the writing and the production and the editing and all the minutiae of making a television show. But the people you work with, that door [into industry positions] has to be much wider,” he continued.  “At a certain point, you realise you have responsibility to create a more welcoming environment and make it possible for a broader spectrum of writing viewpoints, bringing different experiences into the process, so it’s not all Long Island Jews in the room.” None of which is to suggest the United States of Al may not be problematic. The name certainly has issues: is it ever appropriate to shorten “Awalmir” to Al? And there is always the danger of rendering a member of a minority as “the other”, or milking their “exotic” background for laughs. If that is the case, Twitter criticism will have of course been vindicated.  But it feels significant that the pushback against these attacks have come not from Lorre but from the series’s Tehran-born executive producer, the academic and journalist Reza Aslan, whose CV includes the Secret Life of Muslims and The Leftovers.  This isn’t the first Twitter flap in which Aslan has been embroiled. He stood up to the narrow-mindedness of Fox News in a 2013 viral interview in which the interviewer asked how Aslan, a Muslim, could write a book about Jesus. “I am a scholar of religions with four degrees, including one in the New Testament, and fluency in biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim,” he said. “It's not that I'm just some Muslim writing about Jesus,"" he continued. ""I am an expert with a PhD in the history of religions.” He has, it is true, been caught up in previous controversies. His CNN series Believer With Reza Aslan drew charges of sensationalism after a scene in which, participating in a religious ceremony with India’s nomadic Aghori sect, he nibbled on human brain. “Want to know what a dead guy’s brain tastes like?” he later wrote on Facebook. “Charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!"" The Aghori are Hindu and the segment was accused of misrepresenting the religion. “With multiple reports of hate-fuelled attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterises Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world,” said the lobby group US India Political Action Committees.  “It is unbelievably callous and reckless of CNN to be pushing sensational and grotesque images of bearded brown men and their morbid and deathly religion at a time when the United States is living through a period of unprecedented concern and fear,” added Vamsee Juluri, a media studies professor from the University of California, in a Huffington Post article.  Aslan has come out swinging in his defence of the United States of Al, pointing out that those rushing to condemn the series were doing so on the basis of a trailer. “You can’t judge a show by a 30 sec trailer,” he said on social media. “Well, you shouldn’t, at least. Still this is Twitter...” “I’m just ok with your opinion,” he continued. “Just wish it was based on facts not feels. I get it. My whole life I’ve been misrepresented on TV. That’s why I came to Hollywood to change that. You don’t have to support the effort. But maybe watch it then s— on it not other way round.” He also insisted the producers had worked hard at casting an Afghan lead. “There are five Afghan characters in the show and four of them are played by Afghans. We saw 100 Afghan leads but sitcom is a specialised genre and it’s very tough to play. But we also have four Afghan writers/producers on the show who’ve done a great job helping Adhir.” As he says, the United States of Al is diverse behind the scenes; certainly on paper it appears nothing but well-intentioned and has the ingredients of the most politically correct sitcom ever seen on US primetime TV. Among the four people from Afghanistan in the writers’ room, is a former interpreter who came to the US on a Fulbright scholarship. It will also touch on taboos such as PTSD. “I get it we are all traumatised but sometimes it's best not to shoot first and ask questions later,” tweeted Mayhad Tousi, an executive producer alongside Aslan. “The show works hand in hand with two organisations – No One Left Behind and International Refugee Assistance Project – to make sure we aren't just talking about SIV program and the plight of Afghan interpreters,” added Aslan. “We are trying to do something about it. Actually changing policy.” The United States of Al arrives at a timely moment, with the Trump White House accused of “closing the door” on Iraqi translators who worked with US forces and are seeking visas to the US. In 2019 one translator, Shaker Jeffrey, said delays to the SIV programme had put him in danger from Islamic fundamentalists.  “I am a hunted man,"" Jeffrey, who had been waiting for a visa for 10 years, told NBC from Germany. “If I return to Iraq, I will be assassinated.” The figures are chilling. In 2016, 325 Iraqi translators received SIV visas. By 2018, the figure had dropped to two. “It remains unclear why the number of visas issued to Iraqi interpreters has declined so dramatically, said NBC “But refugee advocates and lawmakers say it appears to be a case of collateral damage from the Trump administration's overall crackdown on immigration and refugees. As to the “white saviour” premise of an Afghan interpreter living with a US marine  – this was based on reality, Aslan continued. “You are literally talking about a true story. There are dozens and dozens of Afghan interpreters living with US soldiers. We know cause we actually spoke to them. This is literally their story.” Critics will point out that Aslan would of course defend his show; and the jury is still out on whether he and Lorre have been able to strike the correct tone. All will be revealed on April 1 when the United States of Al debuts.  One thing that is certain, however, is that the producers may want to stay off Twitter for the time being. Lorre might be about to be caught up in the biggest controversy since Charlie Sheen went full “tiger blood” on him 10 years ago. ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/politically-correct-sitcom-tv-offensive/
131,,"“Gentle” is a warm and wonderful adjective. It’s what we crave from a touch or a reminder: something kind, light, amiable, free from harshness or violence. So why, when a comedy is described as “gentle” today, does it often sound dismissive, even derogatory? I’ve been writing radio and television comedy for nearly 35 years. Initially, if critics, broadcasters or friends described any of my comedies as “gentle”, I was miffed. But that isn’t the case any more. Great comedy is often challenging, and sometimes that means cruel. Take, for instance, The Thick of It, where strings of joined-up expletives are hurled by characters who appear to hate each other. Or crude, like   or  , full of what my grandmother used to call “unparliamentary language” and puerile jokes. It doesn’t mean they’re not funny, but it does mean that they exclude a large swathe of the viewing public who prefer their comedy with less vulgarity and more wit. Gentle comedy, by contrast, is defined by kindness. Yes, the characters may bicker but there is love and affection. In the last year, stuck indoors under the same roof, we’ve wanted TV shows the whole family can enjoy without someone being embarrassed or appalled. And nostalgia has proved the way forward. Channel 5 whisked the new  l out from under the BBC’s nose; niche TV channels such as Talking Pictures and Forces TV spotted the need for a “comfort watch” and streamed vintage comedy, including Rumpole of the Bailey and my own long-running series Second Thoughts. Another hit, , conveyed a feelgood likeability in its recognisable depiction of the shorthand and warmth of long friendships. It isn’t even a scripted comedy: it’s an eavesdrop on two old friends, each recovering from serious health problems, talking and laughing, while one teaches the other to fish. We want to be by the river with them. We want to be their friend. Each generation has a “marker” comedy and can recite whole scenes from their favourites, whether it’s  ,  ,  ,  , anything written by  ,   films or . When I was young, we’d quote whole chunks of radio’s   on the school bus. The characters we love best have a vulnerability, visible through their bluster. My favourite line from Galton and Simpson’s   is when, as chairman of the jury, his ignorant but hilarious summing-up begins: “Magna Carta! Did she die in vain?” He is like Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) in   and David Brent ( ) in The Office: these characters see themselves very differently from how the world sees them. When, in The Good Life, that uber-snob Margo reads aloud a Christmas-cracker joke – “the Ooh Aah bird is so called because it lays square eggs” – her husband Jerry and neighbours Barbara and Tom fall on the floor laughing, but Margo is almost tearful: “Why is that funny, Tom?” Even if the characters are not related, there’s often a “family” element. In Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’s sitcom  , the old lag Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) keeps a protective, fatherly eye on his younger cellmate, Godber (Richard Beckinsale). “Next year, Rodders, we’ll be millionaires,” the ever-optimistic Del Boy tells his brother in John Sullivan’s   but then Grandad whacks the wrong bolt and the chandelier crashes to the ground. Both those writers invented swear-word substitutes – “scrote”, “naff off” and “plonker” – and reached a much wider audience. In comedy, accidents and disasters happen far more frequently than in real life – and are miraculously resolved or forgiven by the episode’s end. No matter how many times we watch  , Victor Meldrew will pick up a dachshund instead of a phone. We know what’s coming, but it makes us laugh every time, often because we recognise the characters’ traits: “He/She is just like my mum/my boss/my best friend!” In The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer was conveying nobility and strength – not soppy weakness – when he described a “verray parfit gentil knyght”. Gentle comedies can be quietly strong, too. Their audience may not even realise that the writer has addressed serious issues such as class and prejudice with humour, as in the ground-breaking Goodness Gracious Me’s great line, “Going out for an English”. Across more than 200 TV and radio comedy scripts, I’ve tackled everything from bullying, anorexia and adultery to ageing, the menopause, heartbreak and death. Of course, comedy is never “one size fits all”. One day we fancy the slapstick mayhem of The Young Ones; another, the marital tension of Ever Decreasing Circles. In turn, we expect our broadcasters to offer us a kaleidoscope of comedy experiences. In the mid-1990s, I told the BBC’s then-head of TV comedy about my latest idea for a series: “Next of Kin is about grandparents bringing up their orphaned grandchildren.” After a few moments’ thought, he replied: “I’ll have six.” Twenty-five years later, that decisive autonomy and creative confidence has given way to algorithms. I’ve heard “what we’re looking for” edicts and buzzwords such as “noisy”, “cut-through” and “edgy”. The comedy commissioning landscape is now like a “webinar” from John Morton’s sublime comedy about BBC management,  . Thank goodness, then, for radio, the birthplace of a great variety of comedy from The Navy Lark and Round the Horne to After Henry and Ed Reardon’s Week. I had wanted to write a comedy for   ever since I saw her in 2005’s lovely, languid BBC Two series, Sensitive Skin, in which she played a restless wife, unwillingly relocating to the city with her husband (Denis Lawson). So for Radio 4, I wrote Conversations from a Long Marriage for her and Roger Allam, about a couple who met in the Summer of Love but – unlike in so many tetchy and toxic marital series – still love, respect and fancy each other. I’m now writing series three – and, yes, I’m happy if you call it “gentle”.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/tv-comedy-needs-stop-cruel-remember-kindness-classic-sitcoms/
132,Why did Netflix pay $450m for more Daniel Craig and Knives Out? It’s no mystery,"Daniel’s Craig’s post-Bond future has become a little clearer with the announcement that Netflix is to pay $450 million for the rights to two sequels to campy 2019 murder-mystery  . That film was a fun whodunnit in which Craig set aside his Walther PPK and took the opportunity to demonstrate his acting skills went beyond looking grumpy in a tuxedo.  As “Southern Gentleman” detective Benoit Blanc, Craig displayed a hefty sense of humour  – the role was essentially a deep-fried Hercule Poirot impersonation –and a honeyed Foghorn Leghorn accent. Knives Out was also a moment of redemption for director , subjected to the tinsel town version of being frozen in carbonite after fan reaction to his Star Wars jamboree The Last Jedi.  Yet for all that, Hollywood is still doing a double take at the Netflix deal. Knives Out was a hoot. And, with a $311 million gross on a $40 million budget, immensely profitable. Plus, it harked back to the Seventies tradition of bringing together an ensemble cast – Craig shared the screen with Chris Evans, aka Captain America, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and the late Christopher Plummer –  and letting them vibe off one another.  The question the industry is asking is whether two Knives Out sequels, confirmed as starring Craig, are worth $450 million of the streaming giant’s cash. Even if you have all the money in the world – and with 203 million subscribers Netflix is certainly liquid – surely there are limits to how flagrantly you wish to splash it about?  One possibility is that Netflix is trying to lock in Craig, who, for all his surliness as 007, remains one of cinema’s most bankable stars. He only just about agreed to return to Bond for   and, in Knives Out, you could see how much he relished the opportunity to do something other than drive statement cars and kill people. So a double-whammy of Knives Out films could be the start of a beautiful relationship. Perhaps it’s even more personal than that for Netflix, which has found itself outbid as the streaming home of James Bond. In the US, Disney’s Hulu platform has become 007’s HQ (Hulu has a library of 20 Bond films). Search for “James Bond” on Netflix UK meanwhile and you are invited to enjoy Tom Cruise’s Jack Reacher, a movie that is neither shaken nor stirred.  So Netflix can’t have 007. Maybe that is why it is pulling the classic Bond villain move of deploying vast resources to bring to fruition a megalomaniacal scheme : in this case the creation of Knives Out expanded universe.  The other possibility is that it has spotted a gap in the market. Television is becoming more and more like Hollywood, as anyone planning to stream  this weekend will tell you. Disney has expertly pivoted to streaming with spin-off Marvel capers  and  . And it’s going full light sabers ahead with an Obi-Wan Kenobi show starring Ewan McGregor and human mannequin Hayden Christensen. Amazon meanwhile is pressing on with a $1 billion Lord of the Rings prequel that will tell the origin story of evil flaming eyeball Sauron (tragically it is unlikely to be called “The Irisman”). With so much noisy, FX-heavy franchises rumbling to life, it might reasonably be asked whether anyone is thinking of the adults in the room. Netflix is and has already sprung its cheque book into action by signing Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes to lavish deals. And if the jury is still out on Murphy, whose One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest prequel Ratched was a shark-jumping calamity, Rhimes has delivered with  .  With its bawdy baronets and delirious debutantes, that series became one of Netflix’s biggest ever hits (ratings are three times those of season three of The Crown). So there is clearly an appetite among subscribers for TV that is a little ripe and cheesy but which doesn’t feature superheroes or wise-cracking robots. And in Knives Out, Netflix has the perfect vehicle to prove it’s the streaming service of choice for grow-ups.  Admittedly, the price tag is astronomical. Rhimes’s deal, after all, clocked in  $100 million and she's making hours of television, not a mere two films; she may be on the phone to her agent at this very moment. But Netflix is obviously determined to carve out a space distinct from the carnival barkers at Disney and Amazon. And in Knives Out, it has grounds for believing it has acquired its licence to thrill.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/did-netflix-pay-450m-daniel-craig-knives-no-mystery/
133,The Frenchman behind Britain's vaccine miracle feels the pressure on AstraZeneca,"Pascal Soriot was feeling burnt out. The 61-year-old Frenchman at the helm of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine effort had for weeks been fielding calls from the early hours of the morning until late at night from his family home in Sydney, Australia. The task ahead was mammoth. Billions of people around the world still needed to be vaccinated. Many needed second doses imminently. Of those doses, AstraZeneca was expected to provide about 3bn jabs by the end of the year.  Yet, for weeks, attacks had been coming from all sides for the Anglo-Swedish company. By the middle of last month,  , as nation states swerved from halting the rollout of his vaccine to embarking on major immunisation drives. Elsewhere, a wave of vaccine nationalism swept the globe. Countries including India, a crucial manufacturing hub, moved to shore up their supply of AstraZeneca  .  The company has found itself at the centre of accusations that some nations had been hoarding stocks and, late last week, the EU fired yet another salvo, saying   if AstraZeneca could not deliver its commitments to the bloc. The last few weeks have been “really hard for Pascal”, says Sir John Bell, a longtime friend and Oxford University’s regius professor of medicine. “He’s been caught in the middle of everything, and he’s just trying to do the right thing. At the moment, there’s just not enough vaccine to go around.” AstraZeneca's morale is taking a battering but Soirot remains determined, says Sir John. “I said to Pascal, ‘you just have to keep going’. He said, ‘we don’t have a choice, it’s all we can do’.” Executives are acutely aware there is much at stake. Usually, they are “pretty unflappable”, friends say, but Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson have been shaken by being caught in the recent row.   Two weeks ago, they were dealt yet another bitter blow, with the death of AstraZeneca’s head of oncology research, José Baselga, a renowned cancer specialist and crucial member of the  senior team. “José was more than a colleague to me,” Soriot wrote. “He was a friend, and someone I immensely respected and cherished. I will enormously miss having him alongside me, and I will continue to be inspired by his work and vision.” For Soriot, however, there is little time to grieve. Although more vaccines are gaining approval and being rolled out, there remains a shortage of available doses. Amid the scramble, AstraZeneca has found itself an easy scapegoat. The pressure is taking a toll internally.   during the pandemic, and has pledged to continue selling it at cost for developing nations indefinitely. Huge amounts of company resources will have been diverted to this aim.  “People really should not underestimate that,” says Dame Nancy Rothwell, the president and vice-chancellor of Manchester University and a former board member of AstraZeneca. “It will have occupied huge amounts of the board time, of senior management time, of operations time. They could have made billions out of this and they haven't.” Increasing production at speed has been a harder task for AstraZeneca than certain rivals. It was, after all, a relative minnow in vaccine manufacturing until last year, dwarfed by the likes of Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.   Now, however, AstraZeneca is on track to deliver about 3bn doses of its vaccine by the end of 2021 - some 1bn more than Pfizer and BioNTech. Of these, a significant portion will be going towards the  , set up to deliver vaccines to low and middle income economies, with AstraZeneca having agreed to deliver hundreds of millions of vaccines to the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access scheme this year. Pfizer, meanwhile, has said it will deliver 40m doses to the scheme this year. Moderna has not yet announced any deal and is understood to still be in discussions over a tie-up. “AstraZeneca’s is a vaccine which is one for the world,” says Lisa Anson, the former UK chief of Astra and current boss of RedX Pharma. Storage plays a significant role. Whereas some of the other vaccines must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius,  , making it much easier to deliver to third world countries. These are nations that are desperately in need of vaccines, experts say. In Africa in particular, there are fears that immunisation is not happening fast enough – and in some countries, a lockdown is out of the question. “People starve if you shut down in an economy where you know you’ve got to work to eat and if you're not working, you don’t eat. There’s a real human tragedy,” says Sir John. Such work, it is feared, could slip under the radar amid regulatory scuffles in the Western world. Just last week came a fresh wave of complications. On Wednesday, Germany halted the rollout of the vaccine to those under 60, a day after Canada stopped giving it to under 55s,  . Regulators appear unconvinced that the concerns warrant a suspension. The European Medicines Association last week said there was  . It added that “a causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and further analysis is continuing”. The most recent halts to the vaccine rollout follow a stop-start pattern in major countries. Some AstraZeneca shareholders believe the problems are rooted in initial confusion over the dataset from the trials, released last November, in which its partner Oxford University published two levels of efficacy readings.  At the time, it was not entirely clear why the release said in some parts of the trial there had been up to 90pc efficacy for its vaccine, but in another 62pc efficacy. It is believed this discrepancy related to how far apart the doses were given. Further confusion over efficacy was sparked last month, when initial figures from AstraZeneca’s US trial were  . For shareholders, there are fears such confusion ""weakens AstraZeneca’s credibility"". Chris Jones, who up until 2016 was AstraZeneca’s global head of pharmaceutical development, agrees there was a misstep. “Unusually, they’ve not been very good at designing a very simple clinical programme and the messaging has not been clear at all.” But still, he says, the response from politicians has been “completely unbalanced” with countries “looking to blame anyone and everyone to deflect criticism”. Internally at AstraZeneca, there is much confusion as to why it has been subject to such a backlash, given numerous trials have since proved the vaccine to be safe and effective. Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England,  is understood to have told the team that it had “nasty homework but you’ve got to the right answer”. Questions have even started to swirl over whether the barrage of criticism has been sparked by rival companies, keen to drum up sales for their own vaccines. Others say, simply, AstraZeneca has become a geopolitical football. “There seems to be a real issue because it is seen as a British vaccine or English vaccine,” says Ketan Patel from EdenTree Investment Management, an investor in AstraZeneca.  “It just seems odd to me that it's been singled out. And the worst part of it is that it creates a negative sentiment around vaccination and gives a lot of kudos to the anti-vaxxers.” A survey by YouGov last month found that a majority of people in Germany, France, Spain and Italy deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine to be unsafe. “I'm really anxious about Europe,” says Sir John. “They are getting a massive latency. They're essentially unvaccinated. People don’t want the vaccine, and there's going to be lots of deaths, lots of deaths that they didn't need to have.” For Pascal Soriot, it was not meant to be like this. The whole process is “a lot more complicated than we thought it would be”, says Sir John. But, in areas such as the trial readout, “this is what you get in the heat of the moment”. In normal times, researchers would have had the time to work out the dose, the inter-dose intervals, and done studies to test which worked best - all of which would have taken four or five years. “But you really couldn’t do that,” says Sir John. The need to work at pace has been a huge factor in AstraZeneca and Oxford’s work this year. It was last March that US public health chief Anthony Fauci delivered a prediction that it would “take at least a year to a year and a half to have a vaccine we can use”. This warning sent ripples through Oxford; the university naturally believed its vaccine work could be critical and produce what they assumed at the time could be the only Covid-19 vaccine. Back then, Oxford was desperate for a big commercial partner - one that could do manufacturing, work with regulators at scale and handle distribution at scale. Initially, the aim had been to work with Merck on the vaccine - but in Whitehall, concerns were mounting that vaccine nationalism would emerge and that it would be better for Oxford to work with a British company. GlaxoSmithKline was a natural suggestion. Yet the company had already started on another Covid-19 project. It was then that AstraZeneca became involved. “I was starting to worry, because I thought, ‘we're running out of options here’,” Sir John says. “And the guys from the Jenner Institute called me up and said, 'we had a really good meeting with AstraZeneca. And although they're not great vaccine fanatics, they do do a bit of flu, and they're very good at biologics. So they should be able to do this'.” Within days, Sir John had thrashed out the details with Soriot. “He said, ‘look, this is something that we could do for the world, it would be terrific’.” The idea of making the vaccine at cost, and available to the whole world rather than just developed countries, was a red line for the Oxford team. Soriot agreed.  “He said, ‘it's really important not to be seen to be making a ton of money out of this in the first instance, and if it becomes an annual coronavirus vaccine, we'll make a bit of money out of that, which would be fine. But in the acute phase, we're trying to get the pandemic under control, we just need to do it’.” None close to the company doubt its motives, but some argue AstraZeneca would be forgiven for feeling frustrated at getting little credit for the move. Anson, who steered many of the decisions in AstraZeneca’s UK business, said the ongoing row “would certainly put you off doing it as a cost again”. “If you look at the situation right now, I'm not sure that AstraZeneca has had the reputational benefit for doing that.” Board members are said to be getting fidgety, concerned about the hit to AstraZeneca from the row with regulators. “They will be under pressure,” says Dame Nancy. “They’re like any private company, absolutely dependent on what one form of board member used to refer to as its owners, because the owners are the shareholders.” Since the middle of last year, the company has seen around a fifth of its value wiped off, with its market capitalisation now just under £95bn. Shore Capital analyst Adam Barker says this is partly driven by the communication issues, but also by the fact the company “has all this risk, but in terms of the vaccine being approved and sold, it may not map across to the bottom line”. What is more, in a year in which it has diverted huge amounts of time to manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine, it has also made major strategic moves. Late last year, it struck a  , the largest deal in its history, in a major signal it would be broadening out from its oncology focus to more immunology work. “Investors are still trying to digest and understand what the new strategy is,” explains Barker. Amid all this, Soriot has been living in Australia, having travelled to the country in December to see his wife and children, who are based in Sydney and whom he had not seen for a year. Pressure is said to be ramping up on the executive to return to Britain, including from his own board. However, sources close to the company say that all workers in the EU, US and the UK are in lockdown anyway, and Soriot is working normal European business hours. “He’s really easy to get hold of,” says Sir John. “We don't see anybody here anyway.” Still, as the attacks mount from all sides, Soriot’s days are getting more and more packed. “He’s a workaholic,” says one friend. “But he’s doing everything he can. More than you could expect a chief executive to do.”",Business,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/02/frenchman-behind-britains-vaccine-miracle-feels-pressure-astrazeneca/
134,Satan Shoes and rubber-chicken bongs: meet the mysterious ‘art collective’ MSCHF,"Objects of ghoulishly impractical design are a staple of horror literature. A necromantic tract bound in human vellum? Passé. A telescope filled with the rotting ichor of hanged men? Yawn. How about a  , with a drop of human blood in their soles? Now we’re talking.  That last one isn’t sub-MR James fan fiction. In fact, it’s the latest wheeze of viral marketers-cum-professional-provocateurs, MSCHF. Their advertising campaign for the devilish sneakers – fronted by the  , whose 2019 single Old Town Road stormed the charts – has stirred a predictable dust-cloud of controversy. It has also had the distinction of uniting Right-wing Christians and global brands in condemnation.  South Dakota’s Republican governor Kristi Noem wrote on Twitter: “Our kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it’s ‘exclusive’. But do you know what’s more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul.” And Nike failed to see the stunt’s amusing side: they are suing MSCHF for a breach of trademark.  The $1,018 (£740) trainers – limited, naturally, to 666 pairs – sold out in less than a minute when they were released on Monday. But are MSCHF’s actions an acute Baudrillardian commentary on the intersection of internet culture, social-media outrage and art? Or is it just trite agit-pop, as the group’s disdain for vowels may suggest?  “I think it’s one of the best marketing executions I’ve seen,” says Madison Campbell, CEO of Leda Health and expert on start-up culture. “I think it absolutely cuts through. Look at the stir and the noise it’s created. [Lil Nas X’s] followers and customers believe in the authenticity of what he’s selling. That’s him – love it or leave it, he’s not changing. “And I’m assuming not too many Christians buy shoes from him, so maybe it’s not a huge loss.”  MSCHF has form with these kinds of stunts. In October 2019, they marketed a pair of “Jesus Shoes” – again a customised pair of Nike Air Max 97s whose soles contained a vial of water from the River Jordan blessed by a priest – which were priced at $1,425 and were one of the most searched-for shoes that year. Their previous pranks include an app that recommends stock investments based on your astrological sign, a browser plug-in that disguises Netflix watching as a Zoom call, and a rubber-chicken bong.  Some of their “drops” – released via a cryptic website and text messages that spark endless threads on Reddit – have a sharper political edge. Their website Zuckwatch, a password-protected site that looks like Facebook, was a smuggled critique of online privacy. And in 2020, Blue Monkey, a shell restaurant they founded, was shut down within hours. (It transpired that diners who thought they were placing food orders were in fact donating to insurgent political candidates.) Run from a graffiti-clad warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, MSCHF is fuelled by “structured chaos,” according to its 31-year-old CEO, Gabriel Whaley. “My mom thinks we make toys,” he told the New York Times.  The startup, despite raising at least $11.5 million in venture capital since late 2019, studiously eschews corporate trappings. Founded in 2016 by West Point-dropout Whaley, its walls are plastered with mocked-up film posters with employees’ faces Photoshopped into them, and team meetings are held in a giant white pentagram stencilled on the floor. As of 2020, MSCHF had 10 employees, all in their 20s or early 30s. Only one is a woman.  “Being a company kills the magic,” Whaley told Business Insider recently. “We’re trying to do stuff that the world can’t even define. Our perspective is everything is funny in a nihilistic sort of way. We’re not here to make the world a better place. We’re making light of how much everything sucks.” Is the outfit, with its bong-hit zaniness and stick-it-to-the-man posturing, the final death throes of tech-bro culture? Campbell thinks not. She sees their nose-tweaking stunts as illustrative of how millennial stars such as Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish have used social media to market their identity. Taking part in viral stunts is an astute way to control their public image – and sell records.  “We know rappers, singers, and songwriters count on several revenue streams which give them more control, revenue and equity,” she explains. “If we really knew the breakdown of Kayne West’s clothing line versus his music, what would we see? As a black queer artist, Lil Nas X's existence and visibility in most spaces is an act of resistance in a country deeply divided on the importance and equality of black lives and queerness.”   For his part, Lil Nas X has treated the controversy with evident relish. A few days before the Satan Shoes “drop”, he debuted a new single Montero (Call Me By Your Name). It begins: “In life we hide the parts of ourselves we don’t want others to see/ But here, we don’t."" The accompanying music video is cartoonishly provocative. In it, the rapper slides down a stripper’s pole to Hell and gives a lap-dance to the Devil, before snapping his neck and assuming his horns. Lil Nas X's response to the online furore has been equally laconic – he tweeted a SpongeBob SquarePants meme.   Guerilla marketing is nothing new. As detailed by Ryan Holiday in Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, ‘viral’ happenings are often as artfully orchestrated as conventional, starchy press releases. Ikea has used Banksy-style street art to promote its brand, and drink-driving public-awareness campaigns have sprayed parking spaces around trees – “reserved from drunk drivers” – to highlight its dangerous consequences.  It can be taken further: Peter Jackson’s 2005 King Kong remake was advertised with gigantic banana-skins left scattered on rooftops, and Hot Wheels has transformed overpasses with apparent loop-the-loops. Indeed, artists such as Jeff Koons have long probed the boundaries between kitsch, commerciality and reproducibility. Andy Warhol’s endlessly replicated Campbell’s Soup print is an arguable forerunner of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes.  Yet while contemporary critics may have sniffed at Warhol's work, he never set out to offend. On the other hand, offence is the whole point in the case of MSCHF and Lil Nas X's collaboration. It is, after all, the one currency the internet truly recognises.  “What [they’re doing] is very interesting,” says Chris Moos, lecturer in organisational studies at Oxford’s Saïd Business School. ""They are purposefully choosing to alienate one part of the community over another, and playing their sensibilities off against each other. There’s a growing number of young Americans who are not religious, and these shoes are a way of going against ideologies which have been imposed upon them in the past.”  In fact, Moos argues, the “product” MSCHF are selling is not the sneakers themselves. Rather, it is the great bow-wave of internet outrage and hype they have generated. It’s a trend that is increasingly common in the art market, he says. A purely digital collage by the artist Beeple, for instance,  , recently sold at auction for a record-breaking $69.3 million.  “We think of art as something physical, an artefact we can touch and see,” Moos explains. “But in the digital age, we create artefacts that aren’t necessarily physical. And there will be a growing market for purely digital cultural products.” Nonetheless, MSCHF’s all-too-real gag looks like it will land them in hot water. Some customers have called for boycotts of Nike products because of their apparent association with Satanism. That potential loss of income and reputational tarnish is something of which the company will take a dim view, as the intellectual property attorney Zachary Silbersher told Vice. “[They want] to send a message to everybody else that if you use that Nike ‘swoosh’ or its trademarks in a way that they don’t like, they’re going to come after you, and they’re going to be very aggressive about it. They’ll marshal all of the resources they have, and they probably have a lot more resources than you do.”  A telephone conference for that case has been set for June 29. MSCHF’s scrappy stand against corporate power looks set for an appropriately Biblical reckoning.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/satan-shoes-rubber-chicken-bongs-meet-mysterious-art-collective/

136,"Captain Tom's secrets to a long life? Patience, positivity, and porridge","A year ago a shocked and baffled Britain began to receive its first doses of the spirited optimism of the World War II veteran and charity fundraiser  – something that gave the nation’s well-being, in those otherwise bleak weeks of the first lockdown, a boost every bit as valuable as anything AstraZeneca has come up with.  There was something extraordinarily touching about this man, who had managed to live 100 years without having his belief in the decency of human beings or his faith in the future knocked out of him, assuring us that “tomorrow will be a good day”. Many of us were hoicked out of real dejection by the example of someone who had survived not just the Second World War but all the various setbacks and tragedies that befall anybody who lives a long life, and still had a smile on his face.  It is appropriate, then, that in the final months before his death in February, Captain Tom was distilling his wisdom into this last book, a paean to the power of positive thinking. It’s a sort of self-help manual on how to will yourself into the state of mind that will get you to your 100th birthday.  The first chapter offers a few practical tips on how to achieve longevity. Moore had porridge for breakfast every day from boyhood, even asking the Army cooks to prepare it for him specially when he served in the jungles of the Far East. He always ate healthily and moderately – he is “staggered” by today’s portion sizes – and never smoked. He was only drunk enough to be hungover once in his life, when he had too much brandy in Kashmir “in order to impress a lass”. He boasts – and has every right to – of being free of diabetes and high blood pressure in his second century.  The bulk of the book, however, is about adopting the sort of attitudes to life that will make you feel it is worth the candle. Take pleasure in what you have, and don’t envy what you don’t; remember during bad times that everything passes; find ways of helping other people; take pride in your appearance (he never ventured out of the house in his “gardening clothes”); remember the value of “a certain amount of discipline and order” in your life.  He admits to being sad that there’s nobody left to reminisce with about “trams or Zeppelins, parkin, woollen swimwear, weekly baths or gaslights”, but advises his fellow oldies to embrace the Internet and befriend as many young people as possible. For the younger generations he provides a list of questions that might get oldsters to open up their treasure trove of stories: “If you ask us about the most dangerous, risqué or surprising things we ever did, or which was our happiest decade, I promise you’ll be in for a treat.” Having children at 50 helped to keep him young, he says, and I suspect he is right to think that employers missed out on a valuable resource when he found no takers on his attempt to re-enter the job market in his late 80s.  The book is not entirely free of self-help sententiousness (“The overgrown track is always the more interesting option than the well-trodden path”) but if it sometimes veers a little too far towards the impersonal, it’s always quickly rescued by some illustrative reminiscence. He writes – all the more movingly for being matter-of-fact – about growing up with a deaf father and how it taught him self-reliance, which led in turn to his being comfortable in his own skin and never minding what other people thought. As a husband and father, for instance, he never minded being “the only chap doing the ironing or taking the family washing to the launderette”.  Inevitably he quotes the motto of his old regiment, the Duke of Wellington’s – “Fortune Favours the Brave” – but he is less interested in talking about his wartime heroics than the courage it took to bring his unhappy first marriage to an end, or to accept that he could no longer look after his second wife after she became ill and to put her in a home.  He stresses the importance of heroes and role models, and the  objects of his admiration include  ,   and  ; nobody, however, matches Vera Lynn, who risked her life to entertain Moore and the rest of the troops in the Burmese jungle.  Above all, he insists that golden opportunities can always be salvaged from missteps and mishaps. Although he was not desperate to be conscripted, he thinks that the comradeship he found in the Army saved him from being “a rather self-contained and isolated person”. Later on the collapse of his family business led to his taking jobs as a labourer and a salesman for Woman’s Own (“I was too soft-hearted to be a salesman... never quite able to seal the deal”) but he built up contacts that enabled him to become a more successful businessman than ever. And then, of course, if he had not suffered a severe and debilitating fall in later life, he would never have embarked on the fundraising walk round his garden for NHS charities that earned him a knighthood and international adoration.  He also admits that his “competitive spirit” has aided his determination to keep going, and at one point admits that he has his eye on the record for the oldest person to go skydiving, which currently stands at 103. It’s hard not to finish the book, counter-intuitively, with the feeling that its 100-year-old author was cut off in his prime. But at least it gives us a chance to spend a bit longer in his company, to enjoy his wry humour again and to understand how his apparently ordinary life equipped him for his final extraordinary year.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/captain-toms-secrets-long-life-patience-positivity-porridge/
137,It's too soon to tell the story of the Covid-19 pandemic - we're still living through it,"James Bluemel made what was undoubtedly the best documentary of last year,  . That’s a high bar, so his next project was never going to match up. And in Pandemic 2020 (BBC Two), Bluemel set himself an impossible task. The Iraq series worked because here were people telling the inside story of  a catastrophe that we knew only from reports on the nightly news. It gave  us a clearer understanding of the war and its aftermath, with well-chosen contributors. And it covered events that unfolded in one country. But how do you tell the story of a pandemic? And who tells that story? The answer is: quite randomly, if this first episode was anything to go by. It made sense to begin with Qiongyao Xie, a food blogger from Wuhan whose tendency to document her life via smartphone videos meant she had the kind of footage to illuminate the piece. We saw her roaming empty city streets, and heard her delight when she discovered that a branch of McDonald’s was open. She was baffled that the West had not followed Wuhan’s example of a swift and strict lockdown: “The textbook is right here and you don’t even want to take it?” The selection of the other contributors, though, made less sense. Why choose this particular hospital doctor from Leamington Spa; why illustrate the awfulness of parents dying alone in care homes via one woman in Iceland? The fact that Covid-19 has taken the greatest toll on the poorest in society was represented by a man from the mayor’s office in Colombia. There, residents hung red rags from their windows to signal that they were in desperate need of food parcels. An interesting topic, but one country of many with such problems. All of these people made thoughtful contributions, but they were such disparate voices that the film seemed unfocused. There was also a bigger question: was this needed at all? There have been plenty of documentaries about the crisis. It told us nothing we don’t know already. How could we not know it? We’re still living through it.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/04/01/soon-tell-story-covid-19-pandemic-still-living/
138,A royal documentary that’s fit for the Queen – at last,"There is a well-worn template for royal documentaries: half a dozen historians and royal biographers give the inside track on a family they know only from public pronouncements, second-hand accounts and fleeting contact. If the Queen ever stumbles across them, she must marvel at these people discussing her life as if they are personal friends. My Years with the Queen (ITV) was delightfully different: an insider account from someone who really was  , as lady-in-waiting. Lady Pamela Hicks, daughter of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma and first cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh, shared her memories of “Lillibet” with her daughter, India. At 91, Lady Pamela is an aristocrat  of the old school. Designer India is media-savvy and persuaded her mother to discuss her life on a podcast. Now they have transferred it to television, broadcasting from Lady Pamela’s beautiful Oxfordshire home. This spilling of the royal beans was scandal-free but entertaining. There was the time that the monarch, during the 1954 tour of Australia, encountered a load of day-trippers who were looking for the Queen. A dressed-down Lillibet pointed and yelled, “She went that-a-way!” We also learned that the Queen takes two boxes of chocolates with her when she visits friends – one for the hostess and one for herself. More seriously, Lady Pamela recalled being with the Queen in Kenya when news arrived of the King’s death. When they returned to England, a car was waiting on the tarmac. “She said, ‘Ah, they’ve sent those hearses.’  I think it was the moment she realised her life had changed.” Few of us have inhabited such a rarefied existence. India asked what a lady-in-waiting would do if she did not have a tiara to wear to official events. “You borrow from your family.” And if your family don’t have a tiara? Well, they wouldn’t be in the business of supplying ladies-in-waiting. “That kind of family are not,” said Lady Pamela, firmly. I found this more interesting than the reminiscences: a peek into the lives of the terribly posh. And, at times, the focus on the Queen seemed perverse. Even the IRA bombing that claimed the lives of Lord Mountbatten and three others was seen via the Queen’s reaction. But watching India coax memories from her mother did feel familiar: there is value in asking a relative to talk about their early life, even if you have heard it all a hundred times before.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/04/01/royal-documentary-fit-queen-last/
139,"Lord of the Rings, the disastrous West End musical that crippled its backers – and the cast","’s latest scheme to avoid finishing The Winds of Winter and crush any remaining hope in his book readers is yet another   – this time a stage play, due to premiere in 2023 with productions in New York, London and Australia. Martin will work with writer   and director   on this prequel tale. It centres on the oft-referenced Great Tourney at Harrenhal, a competition with jousting and archery, and most likely featuring familiar characters such as a young Ned Stark and his sister Lyanna, Jaime Lannister, Lord Robert Baratheon, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince Oberyn Martell and Ser Barristan Selmy. At the end of the tournament, Prince Rhaegar publicly declares his love for Lyanna, who is betrothed to Baratheon – setting in motion the war that precedes  . Martin clearly has high hopes for the show – along with a healthy ego. Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, he referenced Macmillan adapting George Orwell and Henrik Ibsen, and former Royal Court boss Cooke bringing   (which inspired Martin’s book series) to television in  . Martin added that the show “ought to be spectacular”.  Given the theatrical pedigree of the creative team, the closest analogy might be  , for which   joined forces with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany to continue her story on stage. The show won rave reviews and has become a global hit.  But for every Cursed Child, there is a Lord of the Rings musical. This theatrical incarnation of  ’s fantasy world not only failed to match the success of its source material, it was one of the biggest commercial flops in   history. Development for the show began in around 2002, shortly after the first film in the trilogy,  , took a whopping $887.8 million at the box office and made Tolkein a seriously hot property. Irish theatre producer Kevin Wallace, who’d worked for  ’s Really Useful Group, partnered with Saul Zaentz, the  -winning American film producer (for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Amadeus and The English Patient) who held the rights to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Zaetz had previously made an animated film version of the latter in 1978. Also joining this doomed fellowship was David Mirvish, property developer and owner of the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Canada, and concert promoter Michael Cohl, former chairman of Live Nation. (Cohl was later responsible for Broadway’s most expensive musical flop,  .) The Lord of the Rings team continued to expand, with   – now head of the Old Vic – brought in to supply the lyrics and direct, Shaun McKenna to write the book, plus Bollywood’s AR Rahman collaborating with Finnish folk band Värttinä and composer/orchestrator Christopher Nightingale on the score.  If that sounds like a giant group, it’s nothing compared to the eventual show staged in 2006: a 65-strong company of actors, musicians and dancers, three-and-a-half-hour runtime with two intervals, and a C$30 million (£17 million) budget. That included C$3m (£1.7m) from the local government in the Canadian province of Ontario, with the hope of attracting visitors to the area; they negotiated an exclusive nine-month run of the show, and the 2,000-seat Prince of Wales Theatre planned to charge C$115 (£55) per ticket. An understandable strategy, given that Tolkein’s books had, at the time, sold more than 200m copies. Why wouldn’t those fans come in droves to see the singing hobbits? Also part of the government’s thinking was that the show might help counter Toronto’s recently acquired reputation as a hotbed of SARS. The region experienced a major outbreak after a woman returned from a trip to Hong Kong in 2003, leading to 257 people being infected. So, surely this glitzy new show could help with their pandemic recovery – just as the   aims to do for the West End. But it was a big gamble. Mirvish later admitted that the show needed to sell out every night to cover its staggeringly high overheads. He put the costs at 50 per cent higher than their previous musical,  . Since the Lord of the Rings production couldn’t hope to compete with the movies’ CGI-fuelled battles and magnificent locations, the creatives instead drew on various folk musical traditions – such as Celtic, Finnish and Indian – and added acrobatics, puppetry, illusions, and speeches in various languages, including Elvish. Warchus explained to BBC News that he was making the most of theatre’s immersive quality. “The environment surrounds us. We participate. We are in Middle Earth.” To get the right effect, all of the actors cast as hobbits had to be under 5ft 6in, while the ents (or tree shepherds) towered above on stilts. Those playing the evil orcs were given shoes with a special pogo stick-like spring. Though the emphasis was on scale and spectacle (including a 30ft tarantula that squirted ink over the front few rows), the show did have some experienced actors, too. Tony Award-winning   veteran Brent Carver was cast as wizard Gandalf, and Canadian classical actor Michael Therriault enlisted for Gollum. Warchus’s grand vision was “Shakespeare meets Cirque du Soleil”. What could go wrong? Well, everything. The show did play to 400,000 people, but closed after less than six months – a failure both commercially (not recouping its budget) and critically. A coolly devastating Variety review branded it “a saga of short people burdened by power jewelry”, while the Toronto Star’s Richard Ouzounian said he was “bored of the Rings”, and the Telegraph’s Charles Spencer cried: “It should come with an elf warning! One lives in constant dread of a nasty outbreak of morris dancing.” Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley found the production “largely incomprehensible”. He continued: “Everyone and everything winds up lost… That includes plot, character and the patience of most ordinary theatergoers.”  Drawing his wrath – and sheer bafflement – were the 40-ton stage with its 17 hydraulic lifts, more than 500 cumbersome costumes, and “vast projected images that bring to mind much-magnified biology class slides.” Dialogue and lyrics were sacrificed to the overpowering background music, the performances to the dim lighting, and the actual story to the rushed scenes, even at such an epic length. Although, perhaps that lost dialogue was a mercy killing, given its cod-medieval cringe factor. Prime examples from Brantley included “How often we sang together before you left my father’s house”, “You are wise to ask, Frodo son of Drogo”, and “Then there is a lady in the golden wood, as old tales tell.” What’s Elvish for “My ears are bleeding?” The songs weren’t exactly winners either. Less take-home showtunes, more (per Brantley) “solemn, incantatory affairs”, suggesting “Enya at an Ashram” or the spoof folk music of  . Worse: most of them included lyrics in Elvish, immediately alienating all but the most fervent Tolkein acolytes. The actress playing Galadriel, meanwhile, chose to channel Celine Dion - a creative choice no worse than any other.  The major problem was the sheer volume of ideas. Any sort of dramatic coherence or singular vision had been sacrificed on the altar of excess. Unsurprisingly, there were frantic changes following the Toronto run, with many scenes rewritten or axed altogether. Warchus admitted that they had “tried to do too much” and “get too much onto the stage.” The runtime was hacked down to three hours for the London production - which, at £12.5m, was the most expensive show ever staged in the West End at the time. Costs included a backstage crew of 80, and, over four months, major rebuilding of the Grade I-listed   to accommodate the stage’s three revolves and its hydraulic lifts. Rehearsal time was a generous 11 weeks, plus six weeks of previews for fine-tuning.  Warchus clearly felt the pressure. He admitted to the Telegraph that he’d visited Tolkein’s grave in Oxford. “I went to apologise and to get his seal of approval in case he didn’t like the idea of his novels becoming a stage show.” For a lucky token, he snapped off a piece of a bush by the grave - “I imagined it growing from Tolkien's heart.” Perhaps the subsequent catastrophe was the author’s ghostly revenge.  During previews, the production hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons when an actor got his leg caught in the set machinery. The audience watched in horror as Adam Salter, who was playing a ranger, shouted out “My leg, my leg!”. He had to be helped by other cast members and was rushed to hospital. The producers then cancelled several shows while they carried out belated safety checks. The show was also beset with technical problems, as various elements of the complex machinery failed - causing delays and frustration from audiences. At the very first London performance, the revolving stage jammed and the sound cut out, leaving the actor playing Aragorn stranded mid-battle cry. The starry opening night in June 2007 featured such luminaries as Lloyd Webber and  . The latter called it a “terrific treat” for Tolkein fans, though added the slightly barbed compliment: “The cast worked so hard.” And a few critics were kinder in London. Michael Billington and Sam Marlowe both awarded four stars in, respectively, the Guardian and The Times - although Billington did admit it was “not a show for connoisseurs of acting”, and added that he sometimes shared the impatience of Hugo Dyson, who famously proclaimed during a Tolkein reading “Not another f***ing elf!”. Others were less convinced. Kieron Quirke began his one-star Evening Standard review thus: “People said it couldn’t be done - and they were right.” Ouch. The Telegraph’s Charles Spencer, recalling his dismal experience at the show’s Canadian opening, concluded: “I’m sorry to report that it remains a thumping great flop.” His 14-year-son - surely the target audience - was seriously unimpressed, alternately “sitting with his head in his hands” or “tittering at the ponderous inanities of the script.” Spencer agreed, bemoaning the “flat, portentous or twee” language and painful attempts at humour. Nor did the action wow: the special effects were “derivative” and there wasn’t even “a single decent sword-fight”. He summed up by saying that the show “combines tiresome grandiosity with mind-rotting mediocrity. Its run, I fear, will be nasty, brutish and short.” That last statement proved prophetic. Any hopes of a Broadway outing, or other global transfers, quickly vanished, as the much-hyped production limped to just 13 months of performances, closing in July 2008. By that point, many of the original cast members had left, not wanting to extend their contracts for the final month. The words “rats” and “sinking ship” come to mind. Bizarrely, Lord of the Rings did score five   nominations (for Best Musical, plus its set, lighting, costume and sound), but failed to win any awards - and has yet to resurface. There were rumours of a possible world tour in 2015, but it never materialised. The show’s main legacy is as a cautionary tale for theatrical hubris, and for assuming that an established property is a sure bet - although many have since failed to take heed. But Martin and his theatrical Game of Thrones collaborators should keep those singing hobbits in mind. Westeros might be tough, but it’s got nothing on the West End.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/lord-rings-disastrous-west-end-musical-crippled-backers-cast/
140,Young Sherlock Holmes was ahead of its time – why did the Conan Doyle purists hate it?,"At just 18 years old, actor Nicholas Rowe got to live a dream scenario for any Eighties movie fan – hanging out at the headquarters of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, in the backlot of Universal Studios, playing video games and watching movies.  “I remember playing video games while standing next to Bob Zemeckis,” laughs Rowe, recalling his brush with the director of Back to the Future and  . It was 1985, and Rowe had been cast as the lead in the Amblin-produced adventure, Young . It was the absolute peak moment for Amblin’s output – three years after ET and Poltergeist, a year after Gremlins, and the same year as The Goonies and Back to the Future.  Behind Young Sherlock was a team of Hollywood heavyweights; the film was executive produced by Spielberg, directed by Barry Levinson, and written by Chris Columbus. But Rowe, now 54, admits that he wasn’t up to date on his Spielberg adventures. “I hadn’t seen ET by that time,” he says, “which was a shock to one of the Spielberg people working at Amblin. They said, ‘Don’t tell Steven that! Just sit in the movie theatre and we’ll set it up.’ So I sat and watched ET on my own in this 30-seater theatre, with some popcorn from the machine, and the controls and a phone right by me. I had everything I needed. I was thinking life doesn’t get better than this.” A sound knowledge of Eighties cinema was likely imperative. Young Sherlock Holmes is pure Amblin fodder – a coming-of-age adventure with gadgets, little monsters, and Spielbergian spirit. A Victorian Goonies, perhaps. It’s no great mystery: Chris Columbus wrote Gremlins and The Goonies – both were executive produced by Spielberg. What Young Sherlock Holmes isn’t – in a purist-ruffling irony – is a Sherlock Holmes story. Departing from what Sherlockians call “the canon” – the four novels and 56 short stories by  e – it’s more of a swashbuckling Indiana Jones adventure, with ancient evil rituals and industry-changing SFX. “Most Holmesians are, as you might expect, infuriated by the many sizeable liberties the film takes,” says Adrian Braddy, editor of Sherlock Holmes Magazine. “It repeatedly and spectacularly contradicts the canon.” The composite of ideas might explain why Young Sherlock Holmes was a high profile dud for Amblin – even at the height of the mighty Spielberg’s powers. Still, Young Sherlock Holmes holds strong nostalgia for kids of the Eighties. “I am aware that it has a strong place in people’s hearts,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It will probably always have a place somewhere in a cult collection.” The idea of a young Sherlock Holmes wasn’t new. Though not a Holmes story, Buster Keaton imagined himself as a chip of the old Sherlock in the 1924 silent classic, Sherlock Jr. In 1982, ITV aired the largely-forgotten series Young Sherlock: The Mystery of Manor House, starring Guy Henry as the adolescent sleuth. Now, it’s a common theme. There’s a series of Young Sherlock novels by Andrew Lane, and this week Netflix launches a new Sherlock-based teen series,  featuring The Inbetweeners’   as a grungy, emo Holmes. The mid-Eighties was a curious time for Holmes on screen. In 1984, Granada launched the  -starring series – largely considered to be the definitive, most faithful screen version (Brett carried a copy of the canon at all times to ensure fidelity) – and in 1986, Disney released its anthropomorphised version, The Great Mouse Detective. Chris Columbus wanted to pick apart the emotionless core of Sherlock, by reimagining him as a love-struck teenager. He wrote The Goonies by day, and Young Sherlock Holmes by night. “The thing that was most important to me was why Holmes became so cold and calculating, and why he was alone for the rest of his life,'” Columbus told the New York Times. “That's why he is so emotional in the film. As a youngster, he was ruled by emotion, he fell in love with the love of his life, and as a result of what happens in this film, he becomes the person he was later.” It’s dodgy ground even now. Last year the estate of Doyle   for giving Sherlock emotions in Enola Holmes – itself a gender-swap play on Young Sherlock. Columbus commented that he was “very worried about offending some of the Holmes purists”. When Paramount head Michael Eisner green-lit the film, it offended the ultimate Holmes purist: Dame Jean Conan Doyle, the daughter of Sir Arthur. “When Dame Jean read the script, she was aghast at the violent imagery that was intended for young viewers,” says Gus Holwerda, co-host of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes Podcast. “She was also unhappy at some of the choices that had been written into her father’s characters. As the executor of the Doyle canon, she refused to allow the film to go forward without significant changes. Eisner listened to her concerns, took her council to heart, and hired Sherlockian scholar John Bennett Shaw and novelist Jeffery Archer to revise the script.” (The film is bookended with clunky disclaimers, explaining that it’s not taken from Doyle’s stories, but it's “affectionate speculation” about what Holmes’ youth could have been.) By that point, Barry Levinson’s films had been low-key character dramas – Diner and The Natural. But Spielberg saw Levinson as “a frustrated action-adventure director”. Later, Levinson would direct Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man (which won four Oscars), and Sleepers. In a 1993 book on his career, Levinson recalled that he was drawn to the Victorian setting (the film was shot around Oxford, various castle locations, and Elstree Studios) and working with child actors, though it was hard finding a solid cast of 16-year-old actors. Levinson looked at audition tapes for 10,000 boys. Nicholas Rowe recalls going for a screen test, along with other young actors who were up for the part. “Hugh Grant was there,” laughs Rowe. “And look what happened to him.” In the film, young Watson (Alan Cox) enrolls at Brompton Academy, where he befriends Holmes. Sherlock shows off his powers of deduction by determining the portly Watson’s favourite tarts, based on the custard stains down his lapel. Along with Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) – Holmes’ doomed sweetheart – they investigate a series of bizarre deaths. Victims are shot with poisoned blow darts and driven to suicide by monstrous hallucinations, including a reanimated roast pheasant and an assortment of come-to-life cakes and confectionary (created by stop-motion and puppetry techniques). The film veers into dark territory as the trio uncovers an Egyptian death cult, practicing human sacrifice shenanigans in a hidden underground pyramid. The latter scene is uncannily like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (also released in 1984). It was a common criticism at the time – though the script was written before Temple of Doom was released. “It was a mistake on our behalf, because we hadn’t seen [Temple of Doom] before it opened,” wrote Levinson. Presumably, though, executive producer Steven Spielberg had seen Temple of Doom, considering he, erm, directed it. In the end, Sherlock’s fencing tutor, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins) – who teaches Sherlock the invaluable lesson of “never replace discipline with emotions” – is not what he seems to be, which leads to a rousing sword fight on a frozen Thames.  The conclusion of the film is unexpectedly bleak: Sherlock’s first love takes a bullet for him. But faithful to the canon or not, Young Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking adventure.  “As is the case with many fandoms, a good number of Holmes purists eschew any form of pastiche,” says Gus Holwerda. “I typically count myself among such curmudgeons. But this film is an exception – for me, at least.” Watched now, it feels ahead of the curve as a piece of blockbuster cinema: a superhero origin story designed to jump-start a franchise (we find out background details such as how Holmes got the deerstalker, pipe, and his “elementary” catchphrase).  With a budget of $18 million, it cost just marginally less than Raiders of the Lost Ark. “The production design was amazing,” says Rowe. “The scale of it was there to behold when you walked onto the set. You could see they were ambitious for it, and were throwing money at it. There was a real buzz around the studio. Labyrinth was being made next door!” With its fantastical mystery and boarding school setting – combined with Watson as the bespectacled new boy – it’s now most obviously like Harry Potter. Indeed, Chris Columbus would direct the first two Harry Potter movies. “Little did I know it would turn out to be a primer for the Potter films,” Columbus told The Telegraph in 2013. Young Sherlock Holmes was also a landmark moment for effects, thanks to the wizards from SFX pioneers at Industrial Light & Magic. It was the first live action film to feature a fully computer generated 3D character – a sword-wielding knight who leaps out of a stained glass window and terrifies a poor vicar to death. The “stained glass man” was created by future Toy Story director John Lasseter and visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren. It took them six months to make 31 seconds of footage. The computer that made it was dubbed “the Pixar machine”. The film was ultimately nominated for the Best Visual Effects Academy Award, but cruelly lost out to geriatric glow-fest Cocoon. For another sequence – one that would be easily CGI’d these days – Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox found themselves strapped into a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-style flying machine (a make-believe anachronism that would rile the Holmes traditionalists) high above the set at Elstree. “The wind was up and there was a lot of shouting going on,” says Rowe. “I have a decent head for heights, but at that point I remember thinking, ‘What am I doing? This whole thing is insane.’” Also ahead of its time was the inclusion of a post-credits teaser – now a standard sign-off for mega-budget franchise films. “A lot of people didn’t stay for the credits,” says Nicholas Rowe. “Serves them right. It’s a nice little scene!” The teaser reveals Holmes’ arch-nemesis Moriarty – the set up for a sequel that never happened. Rowe confirms there were indeed big plans. “We had a potential three picture contract,” he says. “They were waiting to see how the first film did…” Like Holmes inspecting a scuffed shoe, it wouldn’t be Sherlock fandom without picking apart what the film gets right and wrong in forensic detail. For Adrian Braddy from Sherlock Holmes Magazine, the biggest liberty is the early meeting of Holmes and Watson. “Even as a child, I found it deeply distracting that Holmes was friends with Watson when they were schoolboys,” he says. “The most casual observer surely knows the duo met while grown men – nearly 20 years later, in A Study in Scarlet [the first Holmes novel, published in 1887].” Also, there’s Sherlock’s canon-contradicting romance. Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock is often unimpressed by women – except Irene Adler, whom he admires for matching his intellect in the 1891 short story, A Scandal in Bohemia. As Watson said: “There was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler.” With its Holmesian affectations and bumbling version of Dr Watson – not the physical, intelligent military man of Doyle’s stories – Young Sherlock Holmes is perhaps more a tribute to the popular image of Holmes, best remembered from the classic Basil Rathbone films from 1939-1946. “A lot of the references and the stuff that’s explained in the film doesn’t come from the canon,” says Braddy. “The deerstalker, the pipe, the cloak, and the ‘Elementary, my dear Watson’. None of those elements appear in the original stories. It’s an origin story for the Rathbone films rather than the real Holmes.” There is some nice attention to Holmes canon and lore, however, such as young Sherlock’s enthusiasm for fencing (taken from a line in Doyle’s The Adventure of the Gloria Scott) and Sherlock’s violin playing (though his younger self needs some practice). As with the original stories, the adventure is narrated by Watson. Also present are a number of actors from other Sherlock adaptations, most notably Nigel Stock as young Holmes’ mentor, Professor Waxflatter. Stock played Watson in the BBC series from the Sixties, alongside both Douglas Wilmer and Peter Cushing as Sherlock. Nicholas Rowe is also a fine choice for a traditional-style Holmes. “He plays the part with the perfect mixture of arrogance, superiority, aloofness and an evolving brilliance,” says Adrian Braddy. Rowe – who hasn’t seen the film in 35 years – is more critical. “I don’t remember being blown away by my own performance,” he says. “I think there are moments where you spot a man learning on the job. It’s quirky. But I love the film.” (Rowe would briefly reprise a version of the role in 2015, in the Ian McKellen-starring Mr Holmes.) Released on December 4, 1985, Young Sherlock Holmes made a disappointing $20 million in the US. “I don’t think they quite knew how to sell it,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It was a strange mishmash. It just didn’t do well at the box office.” “I think the reason the film failed is the same reason it impressed me,” says Gus Holwerda. “It was, frankly, an adult film targeted at children. Virgin sacrifices by an Egyptian cult? Nightmarish hallucinations of terror? The heartbreaking death of the innocent, female lead? Such things were not standard fare in kid flicks of the Eighties.” Away from the classic American suburbia of Amblin’s movies from the era, there's perhaps a disconnect in its English Victorian setting – a Spielbergian film that's far from home. Nicholas Rowe recalls that Spielberg himself was a fan. “I was doing a play on Broadway and he turned up afterwards,” says Rowe. “He told me that he still had a massive soft spot for the film. It was one of his kids’ favourites.” Young Sherlock Holmes gained popularity on the small screen – through VHS and television repeats. “It felt like it was on all the time!” laughs Adrian Braddy.  That it holds up as an adventure, and remains a curious entry into Holmesian lore, is a nod to the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. “There are the traditionalists who think the canon is sacred and shouldn’t be messed with,” says Adrian Braddy. “But that’s the great thing about these characters. You can play around a little bit and put them into other film genres – into that Indiana Jones-style of adventure.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-sherlock-holmes-ahead-time-did-conan-doyle-purists-hate/
141,When Bond went Blaxploitation: Yaphet Kotto’s problem with Live And Let Die,"For  ’s first appearance as   in 1973, MGM went out of their way to make him as unlike his predecessor as possible. This suave new spy drank gin-and-tonics (not vodka martinis), smoked cigars (not cigarettes), and – in a feat zanier than anything ever attempted by Sean Connery – used killer reptiles as stepping stones. In Live and Let Die’s most famous set-piece, 007 runs across the backs of a line of crocodiles. It wasn’t the real 007, but they were certainly real crocs. While scouting for locations in Jamaica’s Montego Bay, the producers had driven past a curious sign: “Trespassers will be eaten”. It marked the entrance to a crocodile farm owned by a man called Ross Kananga. The crew decided to give Kananga a role as Moore’s stunt double for a scene at his ranch, rather than risk a member of their cast or crew to the critters’ snapping jaws. Wearing a pair of crocodile-skin shoes (a joke suggested by Moore), Kananga completed the death-defying dash in just five takes. The producers were so impressed by Kananga that appropriated his name for the film's chief villain, played by the black actor Yaphet Kotto – in another sign that this wasn't Connery's 007, he would be the first black Bond villain. But the role proved to be a mixed blessing for Kotto, who has died at the age of 81. Although Bond was eventually good for his career and led to roles in Alien and Raid on Entebbe, he later complained of feeling sidelined on-set and was all but shut out of the film's publicity campaign. ""The producers did not want to promote me in the film,"" he said in 2007. ""In fact, I found out that Time magazine and Newsweek were interviewing the rest of the cast. I went to [producer] Harry Saltzman and said, 'Why wasn't I included?' 'We were afraid that there's never been a black villain before. We don't want people to think stuff.' So they didn't promote me."" The producers, essentially, feared a backlash if the public found out that their villain was black. The making of the film itself was just as problematic, with not every scene going as smoothly as the crocodile hopping. It took no fewer than 29 takes to film the moment when Bond uses his magnetic watch to unzip a dress worn by buxom Italian agent Miss Caruso (Madeline Smith). This might explain why their love-scene is one of the more stilted encounters in the Bond canon, but the lengthy shoot wasn’t the only mood-killer. According to Smith, Moore’s wife Luisa Mattioli insisted on supervising the scene, keeping a chilly eye on her to make sure there was absolutely no funny business. Moore would hardly have been in the mood, anyway: during the shoot, he was hospitalised with a painful bout of kidney stones. He was put on an a new medication to deal with them, but the pills left him with a woozy head – and bright blue urine. “I was still zonked out and in unfamiliar surroundings, so when I got up for a pee at two in the morning, I opened what I thought was the bathroom door when it was the wardrobe and relieved myself,” he told the Mail. “'The next morning I discovered my mistake when I found my lovely clothes had turned various shades of patchy blue!” Elsewhere, filming was beset by problems. One actor was bitten by a snake, which escaped his grasp and slithered over defenceless actress Jane Seymour (who was tied between two bedposts at the time) before it was recaptured. In filming a thrilling water-chase Moore’s boat veered out of control and crashed through a boathouse wall, twisting his knee and cracking his teeth. “There I was, a fearless 007, hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras,"" he recalled in his autobiography. “Who says I can't act?” The actor also managed to keep his cool when faced with a trapdoor that looked likely to decapitate anyone who used it. But only after he insisted that the door’s designer John Wardley should test it out first. Wardley remembered the scene in an interview with the Huffington Post’s Mike Peake: “[What] proved to me what a cool guy Roger Moore was, is a scene in a bar called the Fillet of Soul run by the villains. There is a table that disappears into the ground once Bond sits at it. This mechanism was quite a sturdy piece of equipment and the director insisted that the sliding floor should come across rapidly as the table disappears. It whistled across your forehead and slammed shut. We designed this contraption and all in all there was about three tons of steel in it. “The director said to Moore, ‘Whatever you do, you must not flinch’, at which point Moore turned to me and said, ‘I’ll do one take – but I want to see him’, pointing at me, ‘do it first.’ So I did, and it was pretty frightening. He then did it, and he did not bat an eyelid.” Although the risky action sequences and rogue reptiles caused a headache for producers, the real snake in the grass turned out to be the film’s casting. With the film’s action moving between New York's Harlem, Louisiana and the Caribbean, Live and Let Die was the franchise’s attempt to cash in on the burgeoning Blaxploitation genre, following the recent success of Shaft (1971) and Super Fly (1972). It was intended to be a bold departure from previous Bond films, an idea winked at in the script. In one scene, Moore starts to introduce himself with Connery’s catchphrase (“My name is…”) only to be cut off by Kotto's Harlem gangster and master of disguise Mr Big, aka Dr Kananga: “Names is for tombstones, baby.” As well as the franchise’s first major black villain, the film also starred – to the distaste of a few bigoted audience members in America’s Deep South – its first black Bond girl. “As Bond, I make love to Rosie Carver, played by beautiful black actress Gloria Hendry, and Luisa [Mattioli] has learned from certain Louisiana ladies that if there is a scene like that they won’t go to see the picture,” Moore wrote in his 1973 James Bond Diary (now sadly out of print). He continued: “I personally don’t give a damn and it makes me all the more determined to play the scene.” Regardless of Moore’s views, many of the choices made during the production now seem shockingly insensitive. The original script featured a major role for an African-American actress as Bond’s main love interest: Obeah mystic and tarot-card reader Solitaire. At one point Diana Ross was among the stars considered for the part. But the producers got cold feet, recasting the role at the last minute – perhaps over concerns about the worldwide box office. At the time, any films depicting an interracial relationship were still banned in several territories, including Japan and South Africa. “While filming somewhere in New York City or New Orleans, they decided that it was too risky to have a black woman end up with James Bond,” Hendry said in a 2004 interview. “Therefore, the [smaller, supporting] role of Rosie Carver was switched to black, and the role of Solitaire was switched to white. That is where I came in.” The producers didn’t feel it was worth their time to find a realistic stunt double for Hendry, and resorted to the controversial practice of  . For one bedroom scene, “They ended up having a white British gentleman in brown makeup with a dress and an Afro wig,” Hendry has recalled. Yaphet Kotto, meanwhile, was not invited to the premiere and and celebrated the film's release with friends in a Harlem bar. “They were afraid the public would react negatively to a black villain so they didn’t play my character up,” he told the Big Issue in 2015. “That hurt me a lot, man. I went through a lot of goddamn emotional hell because they were afraid people would be angry that a black guy was not being Sidney Poitier. I was the opposite of everything he created.” Earlier, Kotto had claimed the producers essentially ""set me up"" and portrayed him as a rabble-rouser: ""One of the actors raised a clenched fist, saluting me, so I raised my clenched fist, and a photographer swiveled around and said, 'You're a militant SOB' and took my picture and gave that to the producers. I had promised Dr. King – I was with him at a couple of demonstrations – that I would never do anything militant. So they had me pegged wrong."" Although the film’s racial politics can look seriously dated today (not to mention its villain's bizarre, flatulent death scene), Kotto felt that having such a formidable black character in a world-straddling franchise “would open up the doors for others – and it worked"". The actor had some personal experience to prove it: he was later offered the role of Captain Picard in Star Trek, but turned it down. He was less positive about his co-star. ""I have nothing to say about Roger Moore,"" he told an interviewer in 2007. ""He said in his book – I don't know if I read it in there, but one of my secretaries told me – he said, 'Yaphet had a chip on his shoulder.' What is this dude talking about? What is his problem? I mind my business, do my job. If he said that, he had no right to because he doesn't know me that well."" But if any part of the Bond series's muddled foray into Blaxploitation was a success, Kotto has said, it's less due to Roger Moore than to the charismatic Kananga: “a guy who is completely together – almost as together as James Bond himself. He was a hero!”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/live-let-die-roger-moore-yaphet-kotto-bond-blaxploitation/
142,The Wonder Woman that wasn’t: inside George Miller’s unmade Justice League movie,"In an alternate dimension, Armie Hammer’s role in Call Me by Your Name would have been a risky departure for an actor best known for playing Batman. Mad Max: Fury Road may never have happened. And Megan Gale would have been a name on everybody’s lips. These were elements of Justice League: Mortal, an early incarnation of the Justice League movie that spectacularly flamed out in 2017 after being botched by Joss Whedon, and has now  . But before both version, Justice League: Mortal was due for a 2009 release under the directorial eye of Mad Max: Fury Road mastermind George Miller. Hollywood projects falling apart over time are nothing new, but Miller’s Justice League very nearly happened. By the time the film had been axed by Warner Bros over issues with its budget, its stars and its script, an array of actors had been cast, costumes had been designed and production was about to begin. It remains one of Hollywood’s most infamous unmade films. Information about the proposed movie has been leaked in anecdotes and concept art here and there over the years, forming a remarkable picture of a slightly muddled - if undeniably intriguing - comic book movie that never came to be. The film’s script, leaked online in 2013 and credited to married writing duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney, depicted Batman as an untrustworthy and vaguely dictatorial crime fighter who creates a surveillance machine known as the Brother Eye, which would monitor the Justice League of America and fellow super-powered civilians. This, surprise-surprise, would fall into the villainous hands of businessman Maxwell Lord, who would hijack the machine and create killer robots to battle the team. Justice League: Mortal somewhat oddly positioned The Flash as its central character, who would later sacrifice his life to save the day in the film’s final face-off. In addition, as Maxwell Lord actor Jay Baruchel told the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Superman would turn evil over the course of the film and battle Wonder Woman. “I turn him into full red-eye Superman,” Baruchel recalled. “And then there’s this big-ass fight between him and Wonder Woman, where he breaks her f------ wrists and s---, and then I die halfway through the movie, and then my consciousness is uploaded into a f------ mainframe and I’m an evil computer.” Production art, prosthetic tests and storyboards have leaked over the years, one by artist Steve Skroce depicting the aforementioned Superman/Wonder Woman fight (though he has since deleted the images), and others depicting Aquaman in costume and Wonder Woman’s home of Themyscira. A  has been in the works for years, and will hopefully see light of day when filmmaker Ryan Unicomb manages to get permission to use characters and images from Warner Bros. This incarnation of Justice League was developed at a particularly hopeful time for DC Comics and Warner Bros, who had achieved success with Batman Begins, the first entry in Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy, and were about to launch a fresh take on the Superman mythos courtesy of Bryan Singer. In September 2007, inspired by the Mulroney script, Miller had signed on to direct the superhero team-up movie, and quickly began to assemble his cast. Looking back at the various breathless casting reports at the time is like taking a glance at the young Hollywood of 2007 in microcosm. There was Adam Brody, fresh from his role in The OC. Jessica Biel and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both linked to Wonder Woman; the cast of Friday Night Lights read for numerous roles; and rapper Common auditioned at a time when he was eager to break into acting. One-time big-deals including Shannyn Sossamon, Michael Angarano and Joseph Cross were also accounted for during auditions. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Miller was specifically looking for young actors who would be able to “grow into their roles over the course of several movies.” They were also noticeably less expensive than the ensembles of Batman Begins and Superman Returns. Ultimately cast were Armie Hammer (long before his  ) as Batman, TV actor DJ Cotrona as Superman, Australian model Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Common as Green Lantern, Brody as The Flash, the late Anton Yelchin as his nephew Wally West, Heroes actor Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman and the lateGeorge Miller regular Hugh Keays-Byrne as the Martian Manhunter. Other roles cast included The Big Sick’s Zoe Kazan as The Flash’s love interest Iris Allen, Stephen Tobolowsky as Alfred Pennyworth, Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul and Judd Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as villain Maxwell Lord. As Hammer told Vulture in 2010, Miller’s pre-production work on the film had been extensive. “They had pre-vizzed a lot of the special-effects sequences, and we saw some of the fight sequences without even having filmed them yet.” He continued: “There was a giant room that he had turned into the storyboard room — this huge conference room that had floor-to-ceiling storyboards on the walls — and you’d start at one point and just walk around the entire room and by the time you were done, it was frame-for-frame the entire movie. We saw it on paper and we were going to bring it to life, we just never got the chance.” The actors had also tried on their costumes, with Hammer describing his Batman costume as having been made from incredibly luxury fabrics. “His utility belt was made from the finest Italian leather and highly polished, and the things that would come out of his forearm, they were titanium but wrapped in very fine leather.” He also revealed that his Batman would have been the first to be able to turn his head in his cowl. An impending writer’s strike had rushed the film into production based on just a few drafts of a script, but as work began, Warner Bros reportedly got cold feet. There had long been concerns about a Justice League movie potentially confusing the marketplace, particularly as the trilogy was in full swing. That had been publicly exacerbated months earlier, when Batman star Christian Bale told reporters that he had not been contacted to play the Caped Crusader in the film, and declared that “It’d be better if [Justice League] doesn’t tread on the toes of what our Batman series is doing.” According to the New York Times, the Mulroneys journeyed to Australia in March 2008 to work on the script with Miller, amid concerns that “the screenplay did not quite meet the challenge of introducing a new series without undercutting the old ones.” The delay in production also meant options on the cast lapsed, allowing them to sign up to other work. This wasn’t a pressing concern, however, as they had reportedly bonded with Miller during trips to his Australian home and were all eager to film the movie. But another problem was on the horizon: namely that the film could no longer be shot in Australia. Miller, who has rarely directed films outside of his native country, was counting on a 40 per cent tax rebate from the Australian government, who would help finance the film in exchange for the work the project would bring to the country. At a reported cost of $250 million, Justice League would have been largely unthinkable without state help. Australia’s federal government eventually declared Justice League would not receive the 40% rebate, citing a perceived lack of Australian actors in the main cast (that was despite Gale, Palmer and Keays-Byrne all hailing from Down Under). As a result, Warner Bros suspended production. An outraged Miller told the Sydney Morning Herald: “A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Australian film industry is being frittered away because of very lazy thinking. If that’s going to be the final decision, they’re throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the rest of the world is competing for and, much more significantly, highly skilled creative jobs.” In light of the decision, production was moved to Canada, with Warner Bros aiming to start shooting in July 2008 for a summer 2009 release. But July came and went, and on the heels of the enormous critical and commercial success of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, released that month, Warner Bros and DC decided to regroup. “We’re not off the notion of a Justice League,” president of WB production Jeff Robinov told Variety at the time. “There’s a massive interest and knowledge in the comic book industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history, where they’ve intersected with each other and what their worlds are. That’s part of the education that we’re going through.” The senior VP of creative affairs for DC Comics, Gregory Noveck, added: “These are big, iconic characters. So when you make them into a movie, you’d better be shooting for a pretty high standard. You’re not always going to reach it, but you have to be shooting for it. We’re going to make a Justice League movie, whether it’s now or 10 years from now. But we’re not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it’s right.” By the end of 2008, Justice League was as good as dead, and Miller announced on Australian television that he had left the project. Declaring that he was no longer involved “in any capacity”, he also implied that the low-wattage of the cast was also a factor, claiming that the studio “seems to want bigger stars in their superhero movies now.” In the years that have passed, several cast members have spoken about the project, with a mix of both sadness over what they felt was a missed opportunity, as well as a slight shrug over its eventual demise. “For a long time, I was like, ‘How great that could have been!’” Hammer told Vulture. “[But] as a 31-year-old who’s been through a lot since I was 19, I wouldn’t want to watch a 19-year-old Batman. I’d be like, ‘Who’s this spoiled rich kid who wants to play dress-up?’” “I used to be upset we didn’t get to do it, but everything happens exactly as it’s supposed to,” he continued. “I still have a lot of learning to do about this, and it’s a constant pursuit for me. If I had been that successful right out of the gate, I would have thought I already understood it all. I know that I wouldn’t have turned in a great performance, or even a good performance — it would have just been whatever. So I’m glad.” “It was a great script, and it was a great director,” Adam Brody told HeyUGuys in 2013. “I’m not saying it would have changed the world, but that movie would have worked, I will say that. [It] would have been a nice little movie I think, but they [Warner Brothers] just didn’t want to cross their streams with a whole bunch of Batmans in the universe and all the other reasons they didn’t make it. “I will say that I don’t have any particular affinity for the Flash. I grew up reading comic books, and loving them, and I still have a fondness for them. Although the older I get, the more saturated the marketplace gets, I find the less I care as a whole.” Even Miller has been slightly “meh” on its lack of existence. “It was very faithful to the comics at the time, very DCU,” he told the Word Balloon podcast. “Ultimately I think it’s good that it didn’t come out as there were some parts that were cool that they got right and there were some things that people were going to hate. Some of it was very aimed at kids.” Speaking to Australia’s Channel Nine, Gale had a slightly warmer response: “As long as my son thinks I’m Wonder Woman [I'm fine],” Gale told “If that means I’m ‘super-mum’, I’m fine.” Along with crediting the film for her friendship with Miller, who would later cast her in Mad Max: Fury Road, she also spoke proudly of a photograph she took in costume that was leaked online in 2015. “It was a really lovely surprise, because I hadn’t seen it for seven years. We were just doing costume trials. We just did full dress, costume and hair and wardrobe, and we did a photo shoot. But I’m glad that we got that far into production that we had those photos!” Miller’s departure from Justice League was met with odd celebration by fans, who had taken to slamming the director as “just the guy who did Happy Feet” and mocking his casting choices. The fresh-faced, all-American Hammer, then a complete unknown, had been repeatedly dubbed “Frat-Man”. “Since he was announced as the director of Justice League, I’ve grown to dislike him and his idiotic casting choices,” wrote Alex Billington of First Showing in 2008. “I couldn’t be happier that he’s no longer involved!” In hindsight, such a reaction is slightly embarrassing. On paper, Justice League: Mortal had story issues, while the timing of its intended release and its lack of relationship with the Nolan trilogy indicated a lack of thinking on the part of Warner Bros bosses… something that has been replicated ever since. But Miller would also go on to direct one of the 21st century’s most relentlessly exciting and justifiably heralded blockbusters in the form of Mad Max: Fury Road, and it remains intriguing to imagine what he would have done with the superhero genre. In light of Zack Snyder’s nonsensically grim adaptations and the Joss Whedon snark crudely stuck onto it with scotch tape, it really couldn’t have been much worse. “It was allegorical, like a story of Greek Gods almost,” Cotrona told Slashfilm in 2015. “He was doing things with the Superman character and Batman character, and all the iconic favourites, that’s never been done before. Watch Fury Road and you can only imagine what he would do with those iconic characters.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wonder-woman-wasnt-inside-george-millers-unmade-justice-league/
143,Sharon Stone and the truth about the Basic Instinct scene that sexed-up cinema," memoir,  , recalls a remarkable number of brushes with death. At 14, she was nearly decapitated taming a wild horse in Pennsylvania; she suffered a stroke in 2001 and was given a one per cent chance of survival. On screen, she’s always been much more likely to kill than be killed, playing dangerous, vampish, villainous femmes who refuse to play by men’s rules. This is what makes Catherine Tramell, the ice-pick murderess in   Basic Instinct (1992), her archetypal role – the one that belatedly turbo-charged Stone’s career at age 34, after years of struggling to get noticed. There was one particular scene that did it, making Sharon Stone into many things at once – A-list movie star for a flaring, all-too-brief half-decade, but also a simultaneous site of eyebrow-raising, never-ending scandal. Everyone knows the one – the scene that she wryly says “has given us all pause, so to speak”. Even after the box office bonanza, it helped Basic Instinct to a scorching afterlife in video rentals that few films have ever matched.  Stone sat opposite five men in a police interrogation room, uncrossed her legs for a second or so, and revealed no underwear. The actual shot lasts about four frames, or a sixth of a second, with the gulping reaction of Wayne Knight’s cop underlining what we may or may not have seen. (Knight, starting to be known at the time as Newman in Seinfeld, has the scene to thank for Spielberg casting him in Jurassic Park, with the following iron-clad logic the director sent to his agent: “I see him in close-ups, sweating, only instead of open legs, it’s a dinosaur.”) Standing out even against the uninhibited trashiness of Basic Instinct in general, the revealing of Stone’s crotch announced a brazen sexual confidence which no other actress in Hollywood would have risked at the time – none of the many, including Michelle Pfeiffer,   and Julia Roberts, who were considered for the role before Stone, who says she was the 13th choice. The only problem with this narrative – one of picking her moment to make a stir with the same cool intent as her character – is that Stone completely rejects it. “There have been many points of view on this topic,” she writes in the memoir, “but since I’m the one with the vagina in question, let me say: the other points of view are bull____.” Everyone agrees on one thing, at least: it was Verhoeven’s idea. Much to the consistent annoyance of screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who feels the film was overshadowed by the notoriety of one shot for which he cannot take credit, there was nothing in his script about Catherine going commando. Verhoeven remembers going to a party in 1960s Holland, and meeting a beautiful blonde who was clearly wearing nothing under her dress. “You know, we can see your vagina,” his buddy went up to say. “Of course,” she replied. “That’s the reason I do it.”  By the director’s account, he sold the scene to Stone in exactly this way. She says it happened very differently. On set, with just Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan de Bont in the room after the other actors had finished their shots, Verhoeven came to her with what she says he spun as a specific technical request. “We can’t see anything – I just need you to remove your panties, as the white is reflecting the light.” Stone wanted reassuring that nothing – or at least nothing more than “a hint” – would be visible on camera. She took her panties off and put them in the pocket of Verhoeven’s shirt, before being shown how the shot would look on the monitor. “It's not like now,” she said in 2014, “where everything is high definition[...] When I looked at the monitor you really couldn't see anything.” The bombshell dropped when she saw the completed film on the big screen for the first time, in a room full of “agents and lawyers”. “I went to the projection booth,” she writes, “slapped Paul across the face, left, went to my car, and called my lawyer, Marty Singer. Marty told me that they could not release this film as it was. That I could get an injunction. First, at that time, this would give the film an X rating. Remember, this was 1992, not now, when we see erect penises on Netflix. And, Marty said, that per the Screen Actors Guild, my union, it wasn’t legal to shoot up my dress in that fashion. Whew, I thought.” “Well, that was my first thought. Then I thought some more. What if I were the director? What if I had gotten that shot? What if I had gotten it on purpose? Or by accident? What if it just existed? That was a lot to think about.” Verhoeven has his own version. “Sharon is lying,” he told Icon magazine in a 2017 interview. “Everyone told her that this scene would ruin her career, so Sharon came and asked me to take it away. I told her no. ‘You accepted, and I showed you the result,’ I said, and she replied, ‘Fuck you.’” As Stone’s agent predicted, the film was indeed embroiled in a ratings spat with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) before its release in May 1992. In fact, that board had dispensed with the X rating two years earlier, replacing it with a new category, NC-17, which was characterised at the time as a commercial kiss of death. Philip Kaufman’s Henry and June (1990), about the sex life of Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin, had been the first cinema release to be stamped with an NC-17, to feeble Stateside returns. After “much soul-searching” and at least seven viewings, according to the Los Angeles Times, the MPAA opted against branding Basic Instinct with an NC-17. To bring it in at the more permissive R level, several cuts were needed to one of the ice-pick attacks and a torrid sex scene between Stone and Michael Douglas, but these were thought to have amounted to less than a second. And the uncrossing of Stone’s legs stayed in – however briefly. If anything, the anticipated controversy around the interrogation scene was eclipsed by another entirely. Even before the film’s release, gay rights groups picketed the movie on the basis of the script, which Eszterhas had sold in June 1990 for the then-record sum of $3m. The issue was the bisexuality of Stone’s character, and the damning treatment of her lover Roxy (Leilani Sarelle), who we learn castrated and killed her younger brothers as a 16-year-old girl, using her dad’s razor. This, as activists argued, was just the latest in a long line of calumnies against gay characters in Hollywood films, triggering them to protest against a whole raft of negative, fearmongering characterisations. While Basic Instinct was being shot, The Silence of the Lambs came under fire for the problem of Buffalo Bill, a drag-fond serial killer often misunderstood as transgender.  Eszterhas, to his credit, took much of this ire on board, and sent a bunch of proposed revisions to Verhoeven during pre-production. None were included, because Verhoeven and the producers felt they diluted the story’s impact. “In 15 years of screenwriting, I've fought a lot to protect my scripts,” Eszterhas told the press as the contentious shoot proceeded. “This is the first time I've fought to change my own script. I find myself in a very perverse situation.” The unusually public spat between writer and director rumbled on throughout production. Eszterhas had wiped his hands of the film as it headed in an ever-more sexually explicit direction, only to come back on board as an executive producer. His power in Hollywood was at least the equal of Verhoeven’s: he’d already written the smash hit Jagged Edge (1985), in a similar vein, and would continue to snaffle juicy salaries for the likes of Sliver (1993) – a voyeuristic snoozefest reuniting him with Stone, who famously despised her co-star William Baldwin – and the catastrophic Jade (1995), a low point for William Friedkin.  An unseemly rush to imitate Basic Instinct led to the heyday of the 1990s “erotic thriller” in all its top-shelf-of-Blockbuster glory. Alan Pakula’s laughable Consenting Adults (1992) was retooled at the marketing stage to try and cash in, while Madonna’s Body of Evidence (1993), which had started production first, came out looking like a much-derided copycat. Demi Moore wasn’t just going to sit around and watch Stone become the bare-all A-lister getting all the work. She weaponised her own physique in the likes of Disclosure (1994) and Striptease (1996), where in the latter case a vast amount of the film’s pre-publicity focused doggedly on her breast augmentation specially for the role. Even Moore’s then-husband Bruce Willis got in on the frolics, with an underwater flash of genitalia in the bedraggled therapy-group whodunit Color of Night (1994). After all the brouhaha over a knickerless Stone, the scramble to pause that one on VHS may not have been quite so enthusiastic. Eszterhas and Verhoeven patched things up over dinner, at the Beverly Hills branch of the Ivy, where Verhoeven remembers the writer graciously saying he’d been correct to ignore the pressure groups and made the full-tilt, maximally crass Basic Instinct he’d wanted to make. They drank, they laughed, they resumed their friendship and swapped ideas. “How about a musical about Las Vegas?”, Eszterhas pitched, as Verhoeven’s eyes lit up.  Showgirls (1995) would capsize this whole clattering bandwagon, and make Hollywood afraid of sex for about 20 years. But that’s a whole other,  .",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/sharon-stone-truth-basic-instinct-scene-sexed-up-cinema/
144,Why Nicolas Cage’s Superman Lives had to die,"In the summer of 1996, Kevin Smith met producer  to talk about the script for Superman Lives – the long-in-development, ultimately-abandoned blockbuster that was, at different stages, set to be written by Smith, directed by Tim Burton, and star . At Peters’ Los Angeles home – which Smith likened to Wayne Manor (Peters had also produced the 1989 version of Batman) – he told Smith there were three rules which must be followed for this updated  story. “One, I don’t want to see him in that suit,” said Peters (according to Smith) about the most iconic threads in pop culture history. “Two, I don’t want to see him fly. And three, he’s got to fight a giant spider in the third act…” Twenty-five years on, that giant spider is like the monstrous manifestation of Superman’s battle with Hollywood – a battle to not only put Superman on the big screen, but to get Superman right. It’s a battle which has left a trail of abandoned, unmade films behind him like a discarded cape. The latest of these almost-were films,   – AKA “The Snyder Cut” – has finally become a reality, following a   in support of Snyder’s vision for the DC ensemble. But Snyder’s retooled, four-hour Justice League is puny compared to the legend of Superman Lives, embodied by the image Nic Cage in leaked test shots – donning a revamped suit, a shoulder length wig, with a sleeker ‘S’ logo emblazoned across the chest, and no red pants – like the biggest “What if?” and “WTF?” in cinema history. Indeed, Superman Lives may be the greatest blockbuster never made – the mightiest, most notorious movie to die a painful, drawn-out death in the fires of Development Hell. So notorious is Superman Lives that a documentary was released in 2015, directed by the late Jon Schnepp – The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? Even now, in the age of the 23-movie Marvel Universe, Superman Lives looks like a massively ambitious movie extravaganza at the dawn of digital effects. The project, which underwent various scripts and phases, was inspired by the early 1990s “Death of Superman” comic book storyline, in which DC killed off and resurrected the Man of Steel – a crafty ploy to boost flagging comic sales.  The film would have included the alien Brainiac – a top-tier villain in the comics – baldy arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, and Doomsday, the monster who killed Superman. The concept of the unfinished, troubled, or cobbled-together Superman film goes back further than Justice League or Superman Lives. Before “The Snyder Cut” there was the “Donner Cut” – a much-hyped alternative version of 1980’s Superman II. Richard Donner – original director of the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman films – was fired mid-production and replaced by Richard Lester. But Donner returned to piece together his version of Superman II for a 2006 DVD. There were other almost-made Christopher Reeve stories. An early outline for 1983’s Superman III, written by producer Ilya Salkind, features Supergirl, Brainiac, and inter-dimensional trickster Mr Mxyzptlk. It ends with Superman and Brainiac jousting on horseback and Mr Mxyzptlk turning the world into a giant puzzle – vastly different but no less daft than the Richard Pryor vehicle that Superman III eventually became. For Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the producers licensed the rights to  , purveyors of stack ‘em high, make ‘em cheap films, the most notorious of which are Masters of the Universe and, erm, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  The film was hit with budget problems. As the legend goes, around 45 minutes has never been seen. One fight sequence featured Casualty’s Clive Mantle as a simple-minded super villain – a prototype of the finished film’s “Nuclear Man”. Canon announced Superman V, but planned to make the film with the unused Superman IV footage. With the character back in the hands of father-son producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, another version of Superman V was pitched, which would have sensibly ignored Superman III and IV and featured Brainiac (him again) shrinking Metropolis into a bottle. The next figure to take on the Man of Steel was Jon Peters, who picked up the rights from the Salkinds – apparently swiping the option from under Warner Bros’s nose. Peters is a former hairdresser who has a rep for having a violent temper, shouting down subordinates, and crowbarring terrible ideas into movies. Peters originally got into the business through his relationship with Barbara Streisand. “He used to be Barbara Streisand’s hairdresser and then one day he became a producer,” said Kevin Smith in 2002. “Because in Hollywood you just kinda fail upwards.” An entire book – Hit & Run by Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters – was written about how Peters and his partner Peter Gruber (“his soulless soul mate”) landed top jobs at Sony and ran the studio into the ground with excess and bluster. At first, Peters' project was titled “Superman Reborn” – “Might as well have said ‘Superman remarketed for a new generation,’” Smith told Jon Schnepp – and went through two script drafts. The first, by Jonathan Lemkin, would have seen Superman killed and literally reborn, with his spirit attaching to Lois Lane’s still-gestating baby; the second draft, by Gregory Poirier (a former porn movie writer who used the pseudonym Hugh Jorgan) was a campy send-up in which Clark Kent goes to a psychiatrist to unload the problems of being Superman. At the time – following the success of Clerks and with Chasing Amy about to be released – Kevin Smith was the sharpest voice in nerd cinema and then-King of the Comic Book Geeks. He convinced executives to let him write Superman. Kevin Smith recalled Peters reaching for some solidarity, claiming that they’d make Superman a success because “we’re from the streets”. Smith – from suburban, middle class New Jersey – doubted the street credentials of the perfectly coiffured producer. But it’s a self-image that Peters has maintained. “I’ve been in 500 fights,” Peters told Jon Schnepp. As an amusing footnote, Peters was also set to produce Under Siege 2, but disagreements almost led to a punch-up with Steve Seagal. After writing his first draft, Kevin Smith was summoned by Peters – this time, bizarrely, to read him out the screenplay aloud. Smith recalled Peters laying back on his sofa and creating a frame with his hands director-style, making an imaginary screen in which he could visualise the action as it was being told to him. In The Death of Superman Lives, Peters denies telling Smith that Superman shouldn’t wear the suit or fly (though other writers recalled similar instructions). But Peters readily admits demanding the giant spider battle. Smith placated Peters and dubbed his deadly arachnid a “Thanagarian Snare Beast”. Across two drafts, Smith had to include more of Peters’ ideas: a polar bear action scene at the Fortress of Solitude, and a gay sidekick robot for Brainiac. Peters also wanted Sean Penn for Superman because he “had the eyes of a killer”. Smith admitted that his Superman Lives script was pure fan fiction. “It was one of those jobs where you’re just like f––– it, write your dream movie,” he told Jon Schnepp. The script was packed with references and characters from the DC Comics-verse. Batman gives a eulogy at Superman’s funeral. In the pre-Marvel movie era, that kind of crossover cameo would have melted the brain of the average fan. Smith recommended Tim Burton as director, not realising that he was effectively firing himself. Burton didn’t like Smith’s script and brought in Wesley Strick to rewrite the script. New elements included the merging of Lex Luthor and Brainiac – creating a double-faced monster named Lexiac – and the robot companion “K” for Superman. Burton was a likely choice. With 1989’s  he had reinvented the Dark Knight and made Warner Bros half a billion dollars. In 1996, Mars Attacks had been a box office dud in the US, but Burton was still a curious, fantastical visionary in mainstream cinema – not yet saddled with the likes of his Planet of the Apes “reimagining”. Burton had little reverence for the Superman mythology and latched onto the idea of the genial, wholesome Superman/Clark Kent as the ultimate outsider – a literal alien. Twenty-five years later, it’s fascinating to imagine how the brighter, primary-coloured world of Superman would have melded with Burton’s twisted, gothic style.   Burton was wary of Jon Peters, with whom he clashed and kept at arms length on Batman. Wesley Strick recalled that Burton filmed Batman in England partly to get away from Peters. “Like force of nature,” said Burton about the producer. “It’s like trying to control the weather.” But it was Peters who suggested the Superman Lives project’s real masterstroke – Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Cage is a lifelong fan (he named his son Kal-El, after Supes’ Kryptonian birth name) and offered to play Luthor or Brainiac before signing up as Superman. Cage seems like a leftfield choice – especially now, after 20-odd years of him wavering between mainstream films, oddball indies, and straight-to-DVD tat – but in 1996 he won an Academy Award, and in the middle of his Holy Trinity of Nineties action: The Rock, Face/Off and Con Air. Cage was planning to go full Nic Cage as Superman. “I was going to turn that character upside down,” Cage later said. Other cast members were lined up: the now-banished Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor – a role he played in 2006’s Superman Returns; Chris Rock as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen; and Christopher Walken as Brainiac. As recalled by Jake Rossen in his book Superman vs. Hollywood, there were some doubts among Warner Bros execs about Cage, and doubters from the fan community hit the geek-centric message boards – a precursor to the rabid internet negativity that surrounds modern franchises. Most controversial – and indicative of how Burton intended to change Superman – was the outfit. In the script, the robot companion attaches to the now-dead Superman like a suit, changing as he regenerates and evolves, until finally Superman dons an updated version of his threads. Several suits were made: silicone biomechanical suits, muscle suits, vacuum-formed suits with laser-powered fibre optic lights – with a distinct lack of red pants. The Superman Lives story is best remembered for that test image of Cage in the upgraded suit, but other test images – with Cage in the more traditional Superman gear – are undeniably tantalising. Burton had a small army of concept artists and effects wizards working on pre-production. As seen in The Death of Superman Lives doc, the design work is vast and otherworldly: monsters, robots, spaceships, bizarre-looking Kryptonians. Jake Rossen noted that merchandise tie-ins were a huge factor – characters and gadgets were geared towards potential toys. The design team experienced the full force of Jon Peters, who would storm in, usually with an entourage of women and children, and show off his new jujitsu moves. “Sometimes he’d get somebody in a headlock,” Burton told Jon Schnepp. “One time he kissed me full on the lips. Now which is better? I don’t know. I think I might have preferred the headlock, or a kick to the face.” Peters explained his macho posturing as “creating an energy of an action hero.” He had more bonkers ideas: he wanted Superman to use his cape like a deadly boomerang, and Brainiac to drive through space in a giant skull. Burton recalled pressure to include Superman having a kung fu fight against a band of ninjas, which sounds decidedly like the “Biff!” and “Ka-Pow!” cartoon violence from the Sixties Batman series Sets were built across soundstages at a cost of $20 million, and Pittsburgh was scouted as a stand-in for Metropolis. But Warner Bros executives were nervous about the script, and yet another writer was brought in – this time Dan Gilroy, writer and director of 2014 Oscar-winner Nightcrawler. Warner Bros had suffered a string of duds – money-losers such as Kevin Costner’s The Postman, and the franchise-zapping embarrassment of Batman & Robin. The studio estimated that Superman Lives would cost $140 million – though Jon Peters reckoned closer to $300 million with marketing and other expenses – which forced Gilroy to scale down the action. Finally, in late 1998, Warner Bros killed Superman Lives. In the aftermath, there were other attempts to resurrect the Last Son of Krypton: a Batman vs. Superman project by Wolfgang Petersen, which at one stage was tipped to star Jude Law as Superman and Colin Farrell as Batman; and a JJ Abrams-written project, dubbed Superman: FlyBy, which had McG and  attached as directors at different times. In one version of the script, Lex Luthor was a CIA Agent and secret Kryptonian, and Superman’s suit came out of a can. Warner Bros finally re-launched the Man of Steel with Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns in 2006 – not a reinvention, but a sentimental nod to the Christopher Reeve films. Singer reportedly kept a photo of Nic Cage as Superman to hand, and pulled it out as a shield against criticism – proof of what was narrowly avoided. To my mind Superman Returns is an underappreciated gem, though not everyone agrees. “Remember the first movie where ‘You’ll believe a man can fly?’” said Kevin Smith in a live show. “This movie’s going to be 'You won’t believe how f–––––– boring this man is.'” A Returns sequel was sort-of planned but scrapped. In 2007, Warner Bros developed then binned  , which would have been directed by Mad Max maestro George Miller and starred DJ Cotrona as Superman and Armie Hammer as Batman. Jon Peters didn’t get his reinvented version of Superman, but he did get his giant spider. A giant mechanical spider would show up for the climactic battle of the Peters-produced Wild Wild West, which bombed in 1999 – the year after Superman Lives was canceled. Speaking at the Toronto Film festival in 2017, Nicolas Cage gave his take on Superman Lives. “I would offer that the movie that Tim and I would have made, in your imagination, is more powerful than any of the Superman movies,” he said. “I didn’t even have to make the movie and we all know what that movie would have been in your imagination. That is the Superman. That is the movie. Even though you never saw it — it is the Superman.” The reputation of Superman Lives is all the more powerful for never being made. It’s hard to imagine the film that Burton envisioned, at the dawn of digital effects, standing the test of time. Attempts to reinvent, redefine, or make Superman “real” – the worst offender being one that actually made it to the big screen: Zack Snyder's dreadful Man of Steel – have missed the point of the character.  Superman should be the purest, most straightforward to adapt of all the superheroes, which is why the original Christopher Reeve-starring Superman has never been bettered – by any superhero film. It remains the template, with the most heart and ingenuity. As proved by Man of Steel, which took a cue from Superman Lives and ditched the red undies, Superman needs the pants.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/nicolas-cages-superman-lives-had-die/
145,"What’s on TV tonight: World’s Most Scenic River Journeys, Grayson’s Art Club, and more","For many of us, what we look forward to most once the pandemic is over is the opportunity to travel again. Following on from its wanderlust-inducing series on great railway journeys, Channel 5 provides inspiration aplenty in this new six-part series, narrated by perennial favourite Bill Nighy, giving us a taste of some of the finest inland waterways on the planet. Among the rivers are the Danube, Mississippi and our very own River Spey in Scotland. But we begin with a trip down one of North America’s mightiest waterways, the Niagara River which runs along the border between Ontario in Canada and New York state in the US, before plunging headlong into the gorge beneath the world-famous Niagara Falls. Connecting two of the Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie), it is a short but tremendously powerful river, which over the millennia has carved out some stunning riverside landscapes. The journey begins with a short hop on a US Coast Guard launch out of Buffalo, upriver through the Chippawa Channel towards the Falls, then onwards through dizzying gorges, whirlpools and rapids before finishing with a tour of Canada’s breathtaking wine country. You’ll be longing to book plane tickets.  A unique recital of Easter sacred music featuring each of the Tenebrae vocal ensemble’s 20 singers filmed and recorded separately in isolation, under the direction of Nigel Short. Among the highlights in a selection of works by JS Bach, Lobo, Purcell, Parry and Allegri. In a chock-full Easter special Kate Quilton gets to grips with chocolate’s basic ingredient at a cocoa plantation in Ghana, and Matt Tebbutt visits a confectionery factory to uncover the mysteries of mint fondant and the secret of what makes white chocolate white. One of the most intelligently joy-giving TV series to come out of the pandemic draws its second run to a close, and we can only hope for more in the coming year. Painting up a storm for Grayson and Philippa Perry tonight are illusionist Derren Brown and Liverpudlian artist Chila Kumari Singh Burman, plus more viewers’ submissions are chosen for the exhibition. The whole run of this series has been a vibrant delight for seasoned paint-splashers and newbies alike.  Lots of ideas here for those keen to get on with gardening again now that the chill of winter is gone. At Longmeadow, Monty Don has advice on mulching and planting out sweet peas for summer colour, Carol Klein revels in the floral displays at RHS Rosemoor and there’s a look at how far daffodil enthusiasts will go to produce the perfect bloom. The second episode in this enlightening series recalls the first major setback of Churchill’s political career when, in 1915, his ill-conceived plan to shorten the First World War via a major offensive on the heavily defended Gallipoli Peninsula resulted in shocking casualties, defeat and his sacking as First Lord of the Admiralty. This nostalgic music series reaches 1984 and the days of Tina Turner’s What’s Love Got to Do with It (did you know it started off as a Bucks Fizz song?), Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax, and the hits of Wham!  ★★★★☆☆ This refreshingly serious biblical epic takes on the modest task of dramatising the life of Jesus, from birth and ministry to crucifixion and resurrection. Jeffrey Hunter plays the son of God, Siobhán McKenna is his mother and Rip Torn plays Judas. It begins with the Roman invasion of Judea by Pompey in 65BC and the appointment of King Herod; the rest, as they say, is history. Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause) directs with stately authority.  ★★★★★ It’s hard to overestimate the significance of Robert Wise’s all-singing, all-dancing tale of Nazis, nuns and scenic mountainscapes – it’s one of the most iconic film musicals of all time. Julie Andrews is a nun-turned-governess for the von Trapp family, and their grumpy patriarch (Christopher Plummer). Gradually, she wins his heart – and the children’s love – through the power of song. Plummer, famously, hated his role.   ★★★★★    Wash Westmoreland’s intimate historical biopic sees Keira Knightley play Colette, a woman who marries a rakish “literary entrepreneur”, Willy (Dominic West). When he publishes one of her stories under his name to instant success, it lights a wildfire story of literary and sexual emancipation. The biographical details are bruisingly observed, and Knightley shoots daggers from behind her cut-glass cheekbones. Interest in this new series will depend largely on one’s affinity for its subject. It’s a biography of a star told through the conceit of 10 photographs taken at pivotal moments in their lives, with comments from friends and/or the photographer. Later episodes cover Elizabeth Taylor and John Lennon, but first up is Freddie Mercury, who grew up as Farrokh Bulsara in Zanzibar and India before becoming a graphic-design student in London and eventually Queen’s frontman. Hearing the often pedestrian analyses of the photos makes you wonder if a straightforward biopic might not have worked better. But what lifts the piece above the mundane are the intimate stories shared by his friends, particularly his personal assistant Peter Freestone, showbiz journalist David Wigg, and his godson, Freddie Mack, whose father, Reinhold Mack, was Queen’s producer. They paint a picture of a shy and affectionate man who overcame a tough childhood to become a rock music great and live as a gay man – a glimpse into Mercury’s life that will delight fans. It’s followed by two Queen concert videos, Queen Rock Montreal and The Story of Bohemian Rhapsody.  Postponed because of the coronavirus, the Women’s Six Nations returns in an altered format for one year only – rather than one group of six, there will be two groups of three, with the winners of the two groups facing off in a final in three weekends time. England, back-to-back Grand Slam winners in 2019 and 2020, are clear favourites and they begin at Castle Park, Doncaster today against Scotland (3pm). Their closest rivals are likely to be France, who host Wales in Brittany tonight (8pm), with an improving Welsh side still hampered by the WRU’s postponed promises to turn the side professional. Ireland and Italy join the fray next weekend. This sun-drenched tournament in Miami Gardens is often a favourite stop for players ahead of a quiet spring season and returns following its cancellation in 2020. The women’s and men’s finals take place today and tomorrow respectively (1pm).  Following on from their spectacular rendering of Mozart’s Requiem in November, the ENO returns to deliver Handel’s 1741 oratorio specially for television, presented by YolanDa Brown and Petroc Trelawny. Eight leading lights of the operatic world perform in a piece that makes imaginative use of the London Coliseum. Though this instalment of the traditional Christian service is socially distanced, its content remains reassuringly familiar. Alongside Bible readings, The Choir of King’s College and The King’s Singers perform well-loved choral pieces. For fans of Netflix’s The Crown, this third episode of the documentary series treads familiar ground, covering young Queen Elizabeth’s dilemma over her husband, who was feeling emasculated and – horrors! – wanted to modernise. What brings this hour alive is excellent archive footage and insightful comments from big-hitting contributors such as Prof Jane Ridley. Alan Carr returns with this nostalgic reboot of old game shows, ably stepping into Bruce Forsyth’s shoes for tonight’s celebrity-studded opener of Play Your Cards Right. Harry and Sandra Redknapp and Martin and Shirlie Kemp are among the couples gently quibbling over whether to go higher or lower in a bid to win a jackpot for charity. This feature-length bio-doc about Audrey Hepburn weaves archive interview clips with well-chosen interviewees – including her son Sean and the film director Peter Bogdanovich – to tell her life story. Among the gripping nuggets shared are the fact that Hepburn’s parents were Nazi sympathisers and how she starved during the war in the Netherlands. A few jarring dramatic reconstructions detract only slightly from an otherwise high-quality film. Jeremy Clarkson fronts this occasional vehicle in which he critiques the latest TV shows. Expect strong opinions.  ★★★★☆ John Guillermin’s opulent and entertaining Agatha Christie romp captures beautifully the plush glamour of the era (costume designer Anthony Powell won an Oscar for his efforts) and featured Peter Ustinov in his first appearance as Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. An excellent way to whet the appetite before Kenneth Branagh’s all-star new take finally hits the cinemas. It’s followed by Evil Under the Sun, another Christie with Ustinov.  ★★★★★    Based on Ron Stallworth’s 2014 memoir, this rollicking Oscar-winning period piece is a blazing return to form for Spike Lee. It is the true account of a black cop in Seventies Colorado Springs – played by John David Washington (Denzel’s son) – who managed to enrol in the KKK. Lee attacks the ghoul of white supremacism in America, and thrusts his grievances through the letterbox of Trump’s White House. Adam Driver and Laura Harrier co-star.  ★★★☆☆ A hagiographic biopic of Bobby Moore, released to mark the 50th anniversary of the only time a Brit has lifted the World Cup trophy, Ron Scalpello’s account has few surprises but is watchable nonetheless. Efforts are made to contextualise the legend by placing Moore in the Swinging Sixties of Bond, Beatlemania and fashion. There’s an enviable, if eclectic, roster of talking heads including Pelé and Russell Brand.  Josh O’Connor and Jessie Buckley live up to their reputations as two of British acting’s hottest prospects in Simon Godwin’s kinetic National Theatre production, initially intended for a live audience but reworked for an empty Lyttelton Theatre and shot over 17 days owing to the pandemic. Making full use of the space, Godwin’s slightly truncated adaptation is a potent reminder of the thrill of a fearlessly paced Shakespeare production, and at times almost chillingly intimate. If the two best-known screen versions are those by Baz Luhrmann and Franco Zeffirelli, this steers a middle path between them, contemporary like the former without the garish irreverence, as respectful to the text as the latter without being so in thrall that it becomes torpid. A superb cast has Deborah Findlay and Lucian Msamati in excellent form as the Nurse and Friar Lawrence, while David Judge and Fisayo Akinade strike sparks as Tybalt and Mercutio. But it is the leads who leave the lasting impression, equally well matched from impetuous courtship to tragic demise; Buckley in particular brings that uncanny combination of youthful vitality and level-headed maturity that has defeated some in the past.  This one-day classic takes in the cobbled streets of Flanders, including an absurdly difficult climb up the Koppenberg, which combines cobbles with a maximum gradient of 22 per cent. Dutch giant Mathieu van der Poel has had a strong start to the season and is well placed to defend his title.  Easter celebrations get under way with the Most Rev Justin Welby’s service from Canterbury Cathedral and music from Junior Garr and the Spirituals Choir. Pope Francis’s blessing from Vatican City follows, before Katherine Jenkins introduces an afternoon service from Cardiff’s Llandaff Cathedral featuring special performances from Bryn Terfel and Vocal Creation. To finish off a series perhaps unusually preoccupied with time passing, Freddie Flintoff, Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness buy stately sports cars to befit their advancing years, before Harris takes a Toyota Yaris out on the track. Kate Fleming’s (Vicky McClure) loyalties are tested and a new witness emerges in Gail Vella’s murder investigation as Jed Mercurio’s glorious, convoluted, acronym-happy police thriller heads further DTRH (Down the Rabbit Hole). Bring a notepad. Anthony Baxter, director of the excellent You’ve Been Trumped series of documentaries about local resistance to Donald Trump’s Aberdeenshire golf courses, takes a very different tack for this moving film about the life and work of Scottish land-and-seascape painter James Morrison. Still grieving the death of his wife and losing his sight, Morrison displays sheer determination, and his lack of self-pity is admirable; Baxter tells his story with care. Mildly scurrilous and all the better for it, Andy Webb’s documentary considers the build-up to and impact of Anthony Blunt’s exposure as a Soviet spy in 1979, and whether his dossier, still in Russian possession, may harbour secrets alarming enough to leave the current members of the Royal family open to blackmail.   It’s hard to imagine that a documentary about Martin Luther King Jr could ever be dull, such is his shimmering charisma. While John Barbisan and Michael Hamilton’s feature-length affair stints a little on context, it delivers handsomely on bringing man and myth together and offers up pungently persuasive contemporary evidence of how much work is yet to be done.  ★★★★★ The “happiest movie ever made”, Irving Berlin’s musical, set in 1910s New York, stars Judy Garland and Fred Astaire. After the annoying opening number, it settles for amiable romance interspersed with super set pieces, including Astaire Steppin’ Out with My Baby in slow motion, and Astaire and Garland in A Couple of Swells. Gene Kelly was originally cast in Astaire’s role but he broke his ankle prior to filming.    ★★★☆☆ This Richard Fleischer film may not be “historical”, strictly speaking, but it has the “epic” aspect down pat. Einar (Kirk Douglas) and Eric (Tony Curtis) are half-brothers growing up in a Viking settlement. Einar believes he’s the rightful heir to the throne; Eric, however, has a royal secret of his own. There’s much toing and froing, in the form of battles and sea voyages, so sit back and let the pointy-helmeted chaos reign. ★★★☆☆ The classic Gene Wilder adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel, about a boy with the golden ticket to a zany world of chocolate, was always going to be hard to surpass, but surely Tim Burton directing Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was the team to do it? Well, yes and no: Burton’s balance between weirdness and childish joy is often fun, but equally often goes awry. Still, Depp is compellingly oddball as Wonka.  ITV’s adaptations of Agatha Christie’s entire output of Hercule Poirot stories, filmed over 25 years and with all 70 episodes starring David Suchet as the incarnation of the pernickety Belgian sleuth, will be long remembered as one of television’s great series. Marking the centenary of Christie’s ­– and Poirot’s – first publication in The Mysterious Affair at Styles is this briskly lightweight recap of the writer’s life and her relationship with her greatest fictional creation. Richard E Grant invites a swarm of fellow thesps who cameoed in the series through the years – plus an occasional Christie expert and one seemingly random chef – to say a line or two about their admiration for the writer and the enduring appeal of the detective who used his “little grey cells” to such mystery-solving advantage. Taking us from Christie’s childhood in Torquay, and inspiration for Poirot from the thousands of Belgian refugees in Britain during the First World War, on to her celebrated “disappearance”, globe-spanning success and later life at Greenway in Devon, there’s no path here that isn’t already well trodden. But the profusion of clips and famous faces make for perfect Bank Holiday veg-out viewing.  The showpiece of Irish jump racing serves as a prelude to the Grand National Festival at Aintree which begins on Thursday (ITV, 2pm). Fan favourite Tiger Roll is due to race at Fairyhouse. Premier League Darts begins in earnest at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes. Reigning champion Glen Durrant returns to defend his title. Three weeks to travel 35 miles is a pace that suits narrowboat enthusiast Robbie Cumming, who here invites us to join him for another leisurely cruise along Britain’s post-industrial waterways, from Ellesmere Port to – eventually – Birmingham. Continues until Thursday. When the world’s greatest tenors – José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti – got together for a concert at the 1990 World Cup in Rome, they sparked an opera-singing trend that’s remembered by millions to this day. This documentary recalls the story. Alan Titchmarsh does Countryfile-lite, celebrating farming, the countryside and the “great outdoors and the joy of getting back into the fresh air”. Tonight, Alison Steadman talks of her crusade to protect British wildlife, carpenter Wayne Perrey knocks up a garden bench, and some newborn farm animals make their TV debut. Netflix’s Tiger King was one of the big hits of lockdown, a bizarre true-crime documentary series about zoo owner Joe Exotic and his all-too-deadly rivalry with animal rights activist Carole Baskin. Here Louis Theroux revisits footage he shot of Exotic a decade ago for America’s Most Dangerous Pets – including that which never made it into the final documentary – and adds what promises to be a fascinating, recently filmed interview with Baskin. Stripping a gripping drama through the week has become a successful tactic for Channel 5 recently. This latest takes a pair of not especially happy but comfortably-off journalists (Elaine Cassidy, Tom Meeten) and tears their lives to nail-biting shreds after one of them makes a fatal mistake in a moment of panic. If you liked What We Do in the Shadows you’ll love this – another horror-comedy from New Zealand following two spectacularly dense coppers (Karen O’Leary and Mike Minogue) as they investigate things which go bump in the night. Series 1-3 are available on demand.   ★★★☆☆ This monolithic (if slow) three-hour drama stars Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius, who wants his adopted son Livius (Stephen Boyd) to follow him as emperor, rather than Commodus (Christopher Plummer), his reckless heir. But after Marcus is poisoned by conspirators, Livius allows Commodus to rule, with predictably disastrous results. Anthony Mann (El Cid, The Tin Star) directs with stately precision.   ★★★★☆ Jack Black gives an inexhaustibly inventive comedy performance as wannabe rock star Dewey Finn, who poses as a supply teacher at a stuffy private school in order to make some quick cash. Dewey is inspired by his students’ love for classical music and they form a new band, using lesson time to rehearse in secret for a battle of the bands competition. Richard Linklater directs with a light, witty touch. Time to dust off those air guitars.   ★★★★☆   The orphan Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is stuck with his miserable aunt and uncle and their objectionable son until summoned to Hogwarts School to take up his true vocation and learn to be a wizard. Faithful to JK Rowling’s book, director Chris Columbus injects real creativity. The excellent cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. The series is shown daily this week.  The charity version of Bake Off has leavened the interminable final few weeks of lockdown. Watching celebrity participants not much care if they make a hash of a chocolate sponge is a hilarious antidote to the earnest vibe of the regular series. The famous faces tonight are pretty much just here for the good cause – the latter is particularly poignant for Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle, who alludes to her ex-bandmate Sarah Harding’s battle with breast cancer. Otherwise, all is jolly inside the tent with Coyle, presenter Ade Adepitan, comedian John Bishop and Anneka Rice, who kicks off the fun with an opening sketch recalling her jumpsuited Treasure Hunt days. The quartet are asked by Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood to whip up choux pastries, a cake called a financier and a showstopper that represents an item on their bucket lists. It’s not too much of a spoiler to say the contestants barely know one end of a piping bag from the other; in fact, Bishop and Coyle nearly come a cropper with those fancy mixers on the countertops. Edited together to make the most of their ineptness and lightly dusted with jokes and innuendos, this final episode is spun-sugar light.  Liverpool’s disastrous title defence means their hopes of silverware, and European football next season, depend on their success in the Champions League. Sod’s Law, then, that they should draw the most successful team in the tournament’s history, Real Madrid. The champions of English and Spanish football meet in Madrid on Tuesday for the first leg (BT Sport 2, 7pm). Manchester City have a no less daunting task as they host German side Borrusia Dortmund (BT Sport 3, 7.15pm). On Wednesday, Chelsea visit Porto (BT Sport 2, 7pm), while title-holders Bayern Munich welcome Paris Saint-Germain for a repeat of last year’s final (BT Sport 3, 7.15pm). Less than a week away from eateries reopening in England, Fred Sirieix’s food-themed travelogue whets the appetite for fine dining. On a jolly to the New Forest with Chris Bavin, they stop at The Pig in Brockenhurst to sing the praises of its 25-mile menu featuring only regional ingredients. The pace of Kay Mellor’s amiable lottery winners’s drama slackens somewhat in the second episode, with endless scenes of Frank (Neil Morrissey) splurging his stolen winnings on Monaco’s gaming tables. More captivating is a subplot in which kennel worker Colette (Emily Head) owns up to her past. Ross Kemp concludes his documentary series with more visits to private keepers of dangerous wild animals. Among them is Cambridgeshire farmer Andy Johnson, who keeps crocodiles to eat his dead livestock. Animal lovers are likely to find the series distressing. There’s echoes of (the fictional) The Da Vinci Code in this compelling 2011 documentary, in which art critic Waldemar Januszczak argues that there’s a real secret code hidden in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. His out-there idea boils down to a message about the end of times theology that preoccupies fundamental Christians, including the suicidal sect in Waco, Texas.  Although in lockdown many food chains released their secret recipes for home cooks, the ingredients of a KFC bucket remain a mystery. Fred Sirieix returns with the series that offers a twist on the foodie format – Michelin-starred chefs Tom Aikens and Alex Bond tear their hair out attempting to reverse-engineer chicken that’s finger lickin’ good. The latest in the charming series introducing us to the rituals of the faithful focuses on British Muslims. The most moving segment is the birth of baby Rumi, whose head is shaved on day seven in a ritual seen as her first sacrifice. In Being Christian at 11.15pm, loved ones bid farewell at a funeral to one of the Church of England’s first female priests.  ★★★ Curiosity is not a desirable quality in cats, but Chris Miller’s Shrek spin-off could have done with more of it. The story follows the feline swashbuckler (Antonio Banderas) as he retrieves magic beans from Jack and Jill with help from Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis). The gags fall into two categories – “Ha ha, he’s a cat” and “Ha ha, he’s Spanish”. Still, the animation is impressive and it will fill an afternoon.  ★★★★ Available on the streaming service from this month, Bryan Fogel’s damning, timely and intrepid film about the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi pulls no punches in pointing the finger at the autocratic Mohammed bin Salman, and the supine US. Fogel has form with untangling grim stories, as with his Russian-doping film Icarus, and he uses those same forensic skills here. The last hours of Khashoggi’s life are chillingly realised.  ★★★ Part father-son drama, part portrait of a forgotten community, Ricky Staub’s richly realised film blends the real-life stories of the Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, a community of black, urban cowboys in Philadelphia, with a taut tale of a father (Idris Elba) and his son (Caleb McLaughlin) learning to live together. It’s all a bit familiar, but Elba, as ever, brings a statesmanlike gravitas to his role, and the ensemble cast are excellent. It’s available from Saturday. While Janice Sutherland’s documentary is careful not to paint 2011 with too rosy a hue – this was, after all, an age of recession, austerity and violent protest – it was undoubtedly a happier time for the Royal family. The wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge represented, historian Robert Lacey suggests, the final pivot in the total turnaround in fortunes for an institution so long in the doldrums. The story of their wedding day actually occupies a small part of this reasonably absorbing film, with rather too long spent recapping the Cambridges’s long, not wholly smooth relationship. The rest of it is peopled by fringe players in the day’s events; the prerogative to find an original angle occasionally feels a little desperate as Kate Middleton’s uncle rambles on about his pad in Ibiza, or the chorister who sang the solo recalls his nerves. But there are shards of revelation concerning, for example, the security operation on the day, the travails of the wedding photographer or the peculiar real-life parallels with Kate’s 1995 school play. A superior time-passer, although the Windsors’s latest annus horribilis is barely mentioned. Will there be a similar recap for the Sussexes’s nuptials in 2028?  Colin Barnicle’s lively four-part series pieces together the events of a St Patrick’s Day weekend in 1990, when Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was stripped of 13 works by art, including some by Rembrandt, Vermeer and Degas. The case remains unsolved. Paul O’Grady returns to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home to find new owners for more animals in need, starting with a spaniel-cross covered in mites and a pair of Maltese terriers abandoned after being expensively acquired from, it is suspected, a Romanian puppy farm. After 21 years in the TV property business, Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer kick off their 35th series of the popular house-hunting show in the East Midlands, where one young couple are looking for a first home in the underrated villages of Northamptonshire and an older pair are desperate to leave renting behind. The chilliest drama on television comes to a close with Crozier (Jared Harris) and Hickey (Adam Nagaitis) reconciled and a conclusive encounter with the supernatural beast which has stalked their expedition. The second instalment in the anthology series, set in a haunted Japanese internment camp in the Second World War and starring George Takei, is if anything bolder still; fingers crossed BBC Two decides to air it, too.  Katherine Parkinson’s debut play is a layered, intelligent affair, directed by Jeremy Herrin and adapted from Sarah Bedi’s 2019 production at the Arcola Theatre. It focuses on three sitters for an artist: bluff painter-decorator Luke (Mark Weinman), aspiring actor Cassandra (Alex Jarrett) and single mother Mary (Parkinson). Their chatter gradually sees each of them bearing their souls and experiences of grief and betrayal, although bittersweet comedy is never far from the surface. With BBC Three carving out quite the sideline in cautionary tales of online abuse, model Jess Davies explains how old photos have been exploited and misused and investigates what, if anything, can be done.  ★★★★ While we wait for Daniel Craig’s final outing as Bond, the endlessly delayed No Time to Die, it’s a good moment to revisit his first, excellent turn which ushered in a darker, more violent era for the franchise. Craig’s is a brooding, pouting Bond who’s more interested in cracking skulls than bedding beauties. In this instalment, directed skilfully by Martin Campbell, he wins his “licence to kill” and hunts for a terrorist in Madagascar.  ★★★    Nobody goes to Ken Loach films for a pick-me-up, but Poor Cow is among the most gruelling of the lot. Carol White plays Joy, a mother in London whose aggressive husband is sent to jail; she sets up with his friend Dave (Terence Stamp), but more challenges await. White gives the film a compassionate glow, while Loach provides non-judgmental empathy. The plot drifts a little, but never drags. ★★★★ Warren Beatty’s first film in 18 years, this is a beguiling meditation on ageing, disguised as a screwball biopic of the cinema magnate Howard Hughes. Beatty plays Hughes, but the film belongs to Marla (Lily Collins) and Frank (Alden Ehrenreich), who want to make it big. She’s got a screen test with Hughes; he’s the impresario’s driver. Their romance plays out against a pitch-perfect rendition of Studio-Era Hollywood.  This documentary makes a bold promise to “lift the mask of royalty to discover the real Elizabeth Windsor, the woman behind the crown and see the hidden, private Queen.” But, of course, it doesn’t come within a country mile of delivering on that promise. Not even when lip-readers are enlisted to interpret what the Queen is saying in private asides to courtiers or her family – which, though harmless here, does feel intrusive. On the other hand, what we do get is an abundance of lovely and rarely seen footage of the Queen in some of her more unguarded moments, smiling and laughing with family and friends. By far the most intriguing of these is revealed in some unlikely seeming images, shown here for the first time, taken by the private photographer of Yugoslav revolutionary Josip Broz Tito during a visit by the Queen to Albania in 1972. The communist dictator and the capitalist monarch must have hit it off royally, because she seems more relaxed and entertained in his company than in most. Otherwise, though, this is a fairly unremarkable raid on the well-established film and TV archives, with swarms of attendant royal-watchers adding their tuppence-worth, whether we’d like it or not.  Celebrating the 1968 expedition of a team of amateur explorers from Minnesota who, against all advice and with no experience of the Arctic, became the first men to complete an overland conquest of the North Pole. Archive footage, audio diaries and interviews reveal an extraordinary and often hair-raising journey. Green jackets at the ready, this year’s first major gets going at Augusta National in Georgia, with some of the world’s best in scary form. Expect fireworks from US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau. The murder of Sarah Everard has prompted a wider debate about the safety of women on Britain’s streets, with many sharing their experiences for the first time. Julie Etchingham reports on how this might be harnessed to effect lasting social change.   Exploring the work of officers on the North Yorkshire force from an exclusively female perspective. Covering everyone from call handlers and new recruits to the chief constable, Lisa Winward, the second series kicks off with officers in Selby and Scarborough dealing with drug raids, drink drivers and a 999 report of an officer under attack. Back for a second run, the series in which celebrities and their families go head-to-head to prove their quizzing supremacy sees Vanessa Feltz and her beloveds take on Matthew Wright and his – in hope of winning £25,000 for a charity. Anne Hegerty, more used to The Chase, presents. The second episode moves the story on from first reactions to the virus to its full global impact – from France to Kenya and Beirut via Moscow and New York – and how the pandemic impacted different countries and communities in widely differing and often unequal ways. Following the success of series one, comedy couple Lucy Beaumont and Jon Richardson are now Hebden Bridge’s answer to the Kardashians – or they would be, if people shouted “Save it for Bingo” at the Kardashians all the time. In this second run, Jon is loving lockdown, especially the “pub” in his converted garage, while Lucy is climbing the walls and spending time secretly tracking down former boyfriends. Surprisingly entertaining.  ★★★★☆ Rod Daniel’s high-school fantasy is a long, belting howl of Eighties nostalgia and charm. Michael J Fox’s Scott Howard is a loser on and off the basketball court, hopeless with the ladies and the hoop. That is, until he starts to hit a very hairy puberty and discovers that his family are, in fact, werewolves. Cue disco-bopping scenes of acrobatic basketball and Ferris Bueller-esque musical numbers. A justly beloved cult classic.  ★★★★★ David Lynch’s tear-jerker stars John Hurt as the deformed 19th-century Londoner Joseph Merrick, who was exhibited in a freak show as “The Elephant Man”. After being rescued by Dr Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick displays a highly intelligent mind beneath his misshapen facade. The script resists sliding into sentimentalism and Lynch’s peculiar, askance vision of the world makes for an unusual, moving drama.  ★★★★☆   Captain America, Thor, Hulk and Iron Man unite. The results are cohesive and a lot of fun thanks to writer-director Joss Whedon, who leavens the inevitable special effects with clever character touches and nifty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson has interesting moments as the Black Widow, Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk ever and Tom Hiddleston is a slickly cunning Loki, Thor’s brother who plots to subjugate Earth. Comedian Rosie Jones joins Richard Ayoade, Darcey Bussell and Sandi Toksvig as the latest host of a celebrity travelogue on Channel 4. While each of them ticks one or two diversity boxes, none of them are, as Olivia Colman’s wry voice-over notes a “woman, disabled, gay [and] northern”. Stand-up comedian Jones, who has cerebral palsy, is the gamest of guides in this entertaining four-parter in which she traverses Britain with a famous pal in tow. Her first foray is to the Lake District in the company of Scarlett Moffatt, where they dress as Vikings for a battle re-enactment, take the wheel of a traction engine, sleep in a stable and compose some terrible poetry. Jones’s sense of mischief and the surreal makes a nice contrast with Moffatt’s wide-eyed, studiedly empty-headed charm. The framing device is a curious one, in which a fictional Channel 4 commissioner (Rachel Stubbings) grows increasingly frustrated with Jones’s propensity for ignoring health-and-safety regulations in search of adventure, but it does give the novel spin to a familiar format that the series needs, and it’s perfectly timed for the imminent opening-up of tourist hotspots around the country.  Wilting a little in the shadow of HBO’s glossier, louder Lovecraft Country, Little Marvin’s engaging horror anthology series follows a black family crossing America from North Carolina to Los Angeles in the 1950s. The horror may be more psychological than supernatural this time, but the performances (notably from Deborah Ayorinde as the matriarch) hold the attention even when the beats feel a little familiar. A neat twist at the end of the opening episode wasn’t enough to save this slice of Southern Gothic comedy-drama from the chop after one season. Nonetheless, Kim Cattrall puts in an amusing shift as the co-founder of a Christian TV network who finds her grip on her late husband’s business threatened by the emergence of his second family and the dogged refusal of his illegitimate daughter (Melia Kreiling) to be paid off. Cooking only gets this tough once a year, as the MasterChef finalist is crowned after six weeks of competition and one final round of culinary challenges to complete before the exacting judges. In the late 1930s, Winston Churchill’s career looked finished. He had got it wrong on the abdication, on India and, it seemed, on Adolf Hitler as well, until events wholly vindicated his vocal concerns. He duly returned to front line politics and, eventually, lead Britain through its darkest and finest hours. A ripping yarn well told, the third episode of this excellent documentary leaves Churchill having declared “we shall never surrender” as the fate of the nation hangs in the balance. It’s stirring stuff, but never short of nuanced analysis either. David Tennant takes the role of guest presenter for the seventh time to open the 61st series, presiding over the usual current-affairs comedy from Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, and panellists Jack Dee and Helen Lewis. Cue the gags about stuck shipping, Brexit and Suez. Diminishing returns haven’t yet set on for Channel 4’s idly enjoyable reality game-show, with the steady buzz likely to peak with tonight’s final, as Emma Willis reveals the winner of the third series and a prize fund of up to £100,000.  ★★★ A wacky and fun hipster romcom with a Groundhog Day twist, Max Barbakow’s breezy film (which premiered at Sundance and was nominated for two Golden Globes) finds Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti as guests at a wedding which never seems to end. In fact, no matter what they do they’re doomed to relieve the same day in “one of those infinite time loop things” so they devise all manner of goofy, drunken shenanigans.  ★★★★ Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell’s unclassifiable film was met with lukewarm reception by critics who scorned its bizarre plot. But its since been recognised for its greatness – set during the Second World War, it features Eric Portman as a country squire and John Sweet as US Army sergeant investigating strange crimes. A modern-day pilgrimage and profound comment on Englishness.  ★★★★ Never mind the respectable cast and period costumes; Sarah Gavron’s fiery, cage-rattling drama about the early 1900s fight for British women’s suffrage is far from genteel. Carey Mulligan is on scintillating form, showing how Maud Watts was transformed from bystander to activist with riveting emotional precision. As Abi Morgan’s script strips away the reasons for her to fall back into line, her nerve soars through the roof.

146,The night The Strokes brought rock back from the dead,"On a chilly mid-February night in 2001, rock music was reborn in a grimy pub venue in North London – or so it was often later declared. In the days following the  ’ first headline show in the capital, the swaggering young quintet from New York City were quickly heralded by the UK’s music press as alt-cultural messiahs – ineffably cool saviours of the male-dominated guitar-slinging tradition which, at that point, dated back 40 years to the birth of The Beatles, and beyond. In some ways, it really does feel like two decades ago, or more. Even pre-pandemic, the notion of ‘saving rock’ had become absurdly antiquated – indeed, a vain hope for many. After a wave of rock ‘n’ roll revivalism which followed the Strokes’ explosive ‘arrival’ that night, the musical mainstream has been dominated by rap, R&B and synth-pop for a good 15 years now, with rock bands largely consigned to cult status. Equally, the forum for making such proclamations has all but expired. With the NME, who effectively propelled the band to stardom in a matter of several weeks, these days relegated to a marginal online presence, and influential magazines like Q and Melody Maker now defunct, information and commentary are dispensed by any number of specialist websites, none of which pack the near-imperial authority of Britain’s infamous ‘inkies’ in the 1980s and 1990s. On that legendary night at the Monarch, the writing was actually already on the wall. Through the 1990s, I’d worked on an indie magazine called Select, which by the decade’s end was struggling, as the boom years of   gave way to a rather lifeless period where tastes fragmented towards UK garage and rap-rockers like Limp Bizkit, while core artists Radiohead felt the need to reinvent themselves on 2000’s Kid A as techno weirdos.  Focus-group investigations into Select’s future painted a bleak picture. Our retort was: now is like the boring time in the mid-1970s which ultimately fuelled punk rock; kids aged 16 to 24 will always need guitar music, it’s a market requirement – the cavalry will be here any minute. Our reasoning fell on deaf ears, and the publishers wound up Select in mid-December 2000. So, my own personal mood was understandably along the lines of ‘told you so’, when, barely six weeks later, I was eking a few quid as the Monarch’s house DJ for the night, and there, clear as day, the cavalry galloped onstage. The Strokes, with their crumpled suit jackets, artfully dishevelled hair and droopy-lidded insouciance, were the post-millennial shot of energy that rock fans of all ages – and both genders – were crying out for. As well as impossibly photogenic, their music plainly shunned pop’s increasingly overwrought digitization, keying into a crunchy New York lineage forever known as “the Velvets to the Voidoids”, with their louche, puppy-cheeked singer, Julian Casablancas, suavely poised as a new Lou Reed. During their handful of songs that night, I remember one noted female critic barrelling over to whisper in my ear, “They sound like Gene!”, referring to a critically unfavoured late-Britpop ensemble. Overall, though, the packed crowd of 200 scenesters were exultant, as if indeed the Second Coming was upon us.  Their big tune at that stage was Last Nite, from their doubled A-sided debut single, a solid-gold party-starter about romantic miscommunication, whose tensile riffing – loosely nicked from American Girl by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers – came as a mighty breath of fresh air after all of Radiohead’s hand-wringing quest for hi-tech originality. The flipside, The Modern Age, told of another clueless couple who amusingly can’t work out how to act in each other’s company – unpretentious, light-hearted rock ‘n’ roll fare – while another immediate stand-out, New York City Cops, railed at their local constabulary (“they’re not too smart!”) with a smirking sense of self-awareness at the goofiness of making such a statement. By the autumn, they’d drop the song from their set, out of deference to the NYPD’s many heroes amid the horror of 9/11, but through those preceding months the Strokes essentially redefined rock ‘n’ roll as a young and carefree artform. When I met them on their return to London in June ’01, they were dizzy from the outright hysteria that greeted them at the previous night’s sell-out 1,000-capacity show at Heaven. Gathered around a rooftop pub table in Islington, they had little interest in serious analysis of their work, as they nattered in scarcely veiled terms about their respective conquests back at the hotel after the show. “Every place you go,” Casablancas informed me, between gales of giggling, “there are always cool people and less cool people. I can’t remember where we were on tour, but I was taking a shower, and Albert [Hammond Jr, guitarist] was doing phoner interviews. Afterwards he walked in saying, ‘I just don’t like these very serious – British –  !’ He’d obviously got off the phone with someone going, ‘What is your message for the children of the UK?’ He’s like, ‘I dunno, I’m just a kid myself!’” The Strokes were, indeed, a bunch of hearty youths suddenly having the time of their lives. As we talked, they fought amongst themselves over two vast boxes of free clothes. Barely into their early 20s, they distractedly detailed how they’d had their first rehearsal together in October 1998, played their first gig in September 1999, and after the Monarch show, had performed a sell-out show back home, where, said Casablancas, news of their Transatlantic success had piqued fresh interest.  “The roar was so intense,” he mistily recalled, “it almost made you fall over. But instead of falling over, it just sort of feeds you. It’s like your brain’s getting electrocuted”. The five of them were very conscious that they’d landed in the right place at the right time. They knew that their provenance from New York was a selling point here, where the “I Heart NY” T-shirt was becoming ubiquitous as a generation of young adults capitalised on the proliferation of affordable flights to explore the Big Apple. “It’s a lot like London, except it’s open much later,” reasoned their lead guitarist, Nick Valensi. “Everything is at your disposal 24 hours a day, every day of the year, whereas here, man – by midnight you can’t get anything to eat!” Nevertheless, Valensi would soon wind up dating London society starlet Amanda de Cadenet, and it was eminently detectable that day that the Strokes themselves were anything but street urchins. It would soon emerge that Casablancas, whose father founded the Elite Model agency, had met the other members at various private schools between uptown Manhattan and Rolle, Switzerland.  Consequently, their hunger for success would be called into question further into their career when activity became sporadic, and from the off they approached being in a band with a savvy bordering on world-weariness. Valensi beamingly informed me that their first album was going to be called *Is This It?, “because the hype machine is in motion, and there have already been so many magazine articles. By the time people actually get to buy the record and put it into their CD player, they’re already thinking, ‘Is this it?’” They were, however, passionate and instinctive about what they were doing. “We all listen to different stuff,” revealed Valensi, “but there’s some things we all agree on, like The Velvet Underground, Bob Marley,  …and Spinal Tap.   “I don’t like talking about the lyrics,” added Casablancas, “because it’s like explaining a dream. It might f**k up someone’s imagination of it. With good lyrics sometimes, you read them and they rhyme and they make sense and they’re pretty, but then you hear them in the song, and you’re like, ‘Wow!’ The most simple line that even a kid could understand sometimes has the deepest meaning in that context. That’s the power that music has.”  Another hurricane of laughter swept the pub table as the singer’s band mates barracked him for the absurdity of that statement, and he responded by crooning, “That’s the pow-uuurrrgh! of meeew-ziiiiiiic!” with pseudo-Bon Jovi bluster. It was very clear that the Strokes, puerile banter and all, had the magic formula of a perfect rock ‘n’ roll band for their time. Rush-released on 30 July 2001 by the newly revived UK indie label, Rough Trade, Is This It? hit Number Two over here, and enjoyed massive slow-burning success Stateside, eventually amassing global sales of over two million copies. With that, came a deluge of guitar-toting competition from the likes of the White Stripes, the Hives and countless other combos, and a world of pressure, which their dream team simply wasn’t built to withstand. In the NME, their every step was documented and scrutinized: when you’re fielding banner headlines that read, ‘Strokes Write New Song!’, every time you take a creative breath, it must become mighty hard to remain productive. They suffered something of a success freak-out, and were slow to deliver their second outing, 2003’s Room On Fire, which came across as muffled and chorus-shy. When I met them again another couple of years later around 2005’s First Impressions Of Earth, they seemed to have grown up way more than the four years it had been since our initial meeting. They also lamented how all their friends they used to party with at gigs had been priced out of Manhattan by spiralling rents, migrating to the Boroughs.  “It gets kinda lonely up here,” Hammond mused, as he gazed out from their penthouse over the famous skyline. In the interim also, of course, the internet boom had exponentially multiplied the level of scrutiny that anyone in public life had to endure, a process which obviously only intensified through to the ensuing years. Though as early-twentysomethings they were laconic and self-aware, their initial eruption onto the scene can only be reappraised now as days of relative innocence, culturally and musically, never to be repeated. Indeed, what price a game-changing group of rock messiahs in 2021? That cyclical narrative of rock rebirth followed by relative slump seemed to fade out of prevalence around the turn of the 2010’s, as the incoming younger generation discovered their own culture around social media, and accompanying air-brushed sounds characterized by funereal beats and whingeing auto-tuned rappers. Whether that screen-dominated recipe will feel relevant in what has already optimistically been daubed the Roaring Twenties, remains to be seen. In a nutshell, let’s hope not.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/night-strokes-brought-rock-back-dead/
147,"How Lindsay’s Anderson’s If…. gave Britain's public schools a brutal, sharp panning","British director Lindsay Anderson wanted to shoot If…. at his own alma mater, Cheltenham College. “I liked my school,” he later wrote, despite what the 1968 film might suggest. “It was a pleasant, friendly place.” To secure permission from Cheltenham, Anderson submitted to the headmaster what his lifelong friend Gavin Lambert described as “a laundered script”. “They sleight of handed him [with] a script that obviously didn't have a revolution at the end of it with the boys shooting the parents,” said actor  , being interviewed at the National Film Theatre in 2004. Indeed, the boarding-school set If…. is a strange, subversive cinematic rebel. It ends with sixth-former Mick Travis (McDowell) – who’s equally sick of being whacked with a cane and being told to get a haircut – leading a revolution from the school roof, blasting upper-crust types with guns and mortars. “Boys, boys, I understand you! Listen to reason and trust me!” pleads one teacher, before they put a bullet neatly between his eyes. It’s little wonder Anderson laundered the script; it’s not the sort of work that you’d hand in to the head teacher. Divided into seven chapters – including “Term Time”, “Discipline”, and “Forth to War” – the film tells the story of various students as they begin a new school year. It’s a critical essay that has an interpretive power on many levels: a searing indictment of British classism; a call to overthrow the fuddy-duddies; and a surrealist jape, in which the old guard looks and sounds increasingly ludicrous. “Britain’s public school system has taken plenty of stick in the past. Now director Lindsay Anderson gives in another sharp panning,” said the Mirror’s reviewer in December 1968. “Anderson sees the public school system as the modern world in miniature.” Now, as private schools are hit with , Anderson’s own words echo uncomfortably. The British public school, he wrote in a letter to the script’s original writers, is “a strange sub-world with its own peculiar laws, distortions, brutalities, lives [and] its special relationship to a perhaps outdated conception of British society”. If…. began as a script called Crusaders, written in 1960 by Oxford undergraduates David Sherwin and John Howlett and based on their boarding school experiences at Tonbridge (a “Nazi camp”, according to Sherwin). As detailed in Gavin Lambert’s memoir, Mainly About Lindsay Anderson, Sherwin and Howlett sent the script to numerous British producers. One replied that the script was “evil and perverted” (amusing, as Lindsay Anderson hadn’t got his hands on it yet and inserted the climatic massacre). Another producer suggested the writers should be horsewhipped. Finally, they sent it to Ealing Studios/Hammer filmmaker Seth Holt, who introduced the writers to Lindsay Anderson in a Soho pub. Anderson and Sherwin developed the script together, inspired by Jean Vigo’s Zéro De Conduite from 1933 – a surrealist, fragmented short in which the pupils of a boarding school revolt against the grown-ups. (“War is declared! Down with teachers!” cry the juvenile revolutionaries. “We’ll bomb with rotten old books, tin cans, and smelly boots!”) Once again, producers and distributors turned down Crusaders. But Albert Finney – who had started his own production company – helped the script find its way to producer Michael Medwin and then Charles Bludhorn at Paramount in New York, securing a budget of approximately £250,000. Amusingly, Bludhorn had no idea that Paramount UK had already turned Crusaders down; to save embarrassment, the Paramount UK office pretended they’d never seen it. Fearing that the name “Crusaders” would be too obvious to Cheltenham College – a red flag-bearing statement of intent – they decided to also change the name before submitting the cleaned-up script. The idea to call the story If…. came from Daphne Hunter, Michael Medwin’s secretary. They asked her for name suggestions – “something very old fashioned, corny, and patriotic” – to which Daphne responded by reciting the Rudyard Kipling poem of the same name. (Nowadays, of course, any honest-to-goodness Englishman goes weepy-eyed at Ricky Tomlinson doing his heart-wrenching recital in  .) The plan worked. The film was initially shot at Cheltenham College but later moved to other locations, including Aldenham School in Elstree. In an interview reprinted in Anderson’s published diaries – both the interview questions and answers were written by Anderson himself – he claimed there was “quite a lot of affection” in If…. about school life. In the presence of the teachers, the film does have a certain jolly spirit. They are ridiculous figures: fusty, foolish, un-self aware. The headmaster (Peter Jeffrey), a progressive but still-out-of-touch voice among the dusty teaching staff, swells with patriotic pride as he pep talks the prefects. They are the establishment’s next generation – the future pillars of a crumbling Empire. “Britain today is a powerhouse,” the headmaster says. “Of ideas, experiment, imagination – on everything from pop music to pig breeding.” The school's chaplain (Geoffrey Chater) is more unnerving. He delights at tweaking boys’ nipples and hearing their dirty thoughts, and instills them with some fire-and-brimstone fear of God before a military drill. “Jesus Christ is our commanding officer,” he declares. “And if we desert him, we can expect no mercy!” In the corridors and dormitories, the school is merciless and emotionally barren; a place where humiliation is ritualistic and the air is filled with poshington slang (""Shag off, you creeps!""). After a back-to-school initiation – having to get their bits out for matron – it’s all fat boys being tortured, junior pupils branded as “scum”, and heads being flushed down the toilet. It’s survival of the smartest; every schoolboy for himself. Most frightening are the sadistic prefects – called “Whips” – who joke about implied sexual abuse of the juniors, and delight in dolling out physical punishment. (So ineffective is the housemaster – Arthur Lowe, aka Captain Mainwaring – that he’s ceded control of the school’s unruliest elements to the Whips). There are light touches too: a gang of juniors frying up contraband sausages and eggs is an unmitigated joy; and there’s an uneasy tenderness in a blossoming love affair between a sixth former and junior. In one moment, sixth former Johnny (David Wood) makes an offhand remark about his mother dying of cancer. He's a rebel on the surface but really just a boy without a mum – sent away to school to have his emotions and individualism stamped out. For lead rebel Mick Travis, writer David Sherwin commented that Malcolm McDowell gave “the best audition in the world”. McDowell is mesmerising – like the psychotic Alex from A Clockwork Orange, but not quite grown up (indeed, Stanley Kubrick cast McDowell in A Clockwork Orange after seeing If.… and told McDowell to build the character around Travis’s knowing, ironic smile). Speaking at the NFT, McDowell recalled how Lindsay Anderson demanded a “truthful” performance. When McDowell tried out some flouncy dramatics on set, Anderson responded with, “That is dreadful!' I suppose you picked those bad habits up at the Royal Shakespeare Company.” “Well actually, as a matter of fact I did, yes,” said McDowell. “Eric Porter showed me how to do that.” Anderson replied, “Dreadful.” “There were no tricks with Lindsay,” McDowell told the NFT. “You could chew scenery, as long as you did it truthfully.” Travis is full of pseudo free-thinker claptrap – “Violence and revolution are the only pure acts” – and his ideas of rebellion range from the mundane to fantastical: bunking off school to smoke cigarettes, stealing a motorbike, and tiger-like play fighting in the nude with the sultry brunette (Christine Noonan) from a nearby cafe. For Travis, who obsesses over war imagery in a grubby dorm while necking vodka, everything’s a battle for freedom: freedom of youth, thought, expression, sexuality. For Lindsay Anderson, there was a kinship in the implications of violence and sex. “I think that the impulse of freedom naturally finds expression in emotional relationships as well as in action,” wrote Anderson in his self-conducted interview. “Perhaps the film suggests the link between sex and anarchy, if you like – the emotional of liberating quality that there is, or should be, in sex.” There’s something else about Travis: he's a romanticist who’s vulnerable beneath the swagger and bombast. In one of the film’s best-remembered scenes, Travis takes a brutal, protracted caning from the Whips. After taking his licks in silence, facing away from the camera, Travis wipes away a tear before turning back to face them and shaking hands. (Anderson and McDowell returned to Travis in sort-of sequels O Lucky Man! and Britannia Hospital, but those versions of the character are very different – Mick Travis in name only.) If.… was notable for combining scenes of colour and black and white – a technique that could be pored over for subliminal meaning, but was in truth arbitrary. Anderson decided to shoot the chapel scenes in monochrome because of budget restrictions on lighting equipment. There was no need to explain the jarring visual change. “I’ll just shoot a few other scenes in black and white when I feel like it,” he said.  According to Gavin Lambert, it became a way to “disrupt” the audience. The effect is staggeringly beautiful. “There are many other ways of disrupting an audience, of course,” wrote Lambert, “and what matters here is the creative instinct that turned a limitation to advantage.” Like Travis’s gang, the subversive, surrealist elements of If…. intensify as the film progresses: see a house master’s wife walking nude through the abandoned dormitories; the appearance of a knight in full armour; and a military drill which turns nasty when Travis bayonets the chaplain to death. The chaplain then reemerges unharmed, popping out from the top drawer of the headmaster’s bookcase. If… was prescient before it was even released – 1968 saw protests and student-led demonstrations around the globe, charged by workers’ strikes, Vietnam, and the Civil Rights movement. Shortly after production began, student protests in Paris sparked a period of civil unrest. There were other protests in London, across Europe, and on American campuses.  Anderson denied the film was “trendy” but thought that he and David Sherwin may have been “prophetic” with the story. “I mean forecasting the shape of things to come,” wrote Anderson. “The conflict between established tradition and youthful independence that is evidently breaking out all over the world.” In the final scenes, Travis and his comrades discover a stock of automatic weapons and launch an assault on speech day – a sort of posh parents’ evening – massacring teachers and parents, and exchanging gunfire with the Whips, their future oppressors. Anderson saves one last surreal visual for the shoot-out: a gun-toting granny, who screams “Bastards! Bastards!” as she returns fire. According to David Gladwell, the film’s editor, Lindsay Anderson saw every possible combination of shots and scenes, with all possible alternative takes, before he was satisfied with the film. Paramount was concerned with more surreal scenes (someone in Paramount described it as “an incitement to revolution”) but Anderson held fast. He had to compromise with censors though, editing out some boys’ nudity in order to keep the full frontal shots of the house master’s wife. Released on December 19, 1968, If.… was called a “a hand-grenade of a film” by the Evening Standard. A BBC critic said it was “very close to the borders of fascism”. The Guardian’s critic said, “I feel absolutely convinced this film is going to have the success it deserves. If it doesn’t then there’s no hope for British cinemas.” If.… won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1969. The British Ambassador to France responded by calling the film “an insult to the nation”. (“No doubt to Anderson’s pleasure,” wrote media professor David Buckingham in an essay on the film). The rousing, riling-up power of If.... touched a nerve on both of the battle between the establishment and rebels. As Mick Travis says in one of his angsty ponderings, “War is the last creative act.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/lindsays-andersons-gave-britains-public-schools-brutal-sharp/
148,It's a Sin... to steal: how Pet Shop Boys’ hit single ignited the music industry's strangest feud,", Channel 4’s drama about a group of gay friends in the Eighties as the  appears on the horizon, has been receiving rave reviews for its humanity, heart and humour. But the   song after which the hit show is named can lay claim to its own dramatic story, albeit one that is more bonkers than poignant. It’s a Sin was the second UK number one single for the deadpan synth-pop duo, often dubbed the Gilbert and George of pop. The song topped the charts for three weeks in July 1987. A gloriously over-the-top track that featured a NASA countdown, claps of thunder, choral chanting and quotes from the Latin Mass, It’s a Sin marked the peak of what Pet Shop Boys’ singer Neil Tennant would memorably call the band’s “imperial phase”. It also had one of the most catchy synth hooks of the decade. But in what must rank as one of the most bizarre incidents in the colourful world of 1980s pop, the song saw the Pet Shop Boys accused of plagiarism by the (since disgraced) columnist and music mogul Jonathan King. King very publicly claimed that It’s a Sin had stolen its melody from Cat Stevens’ 1970 hit Wild World. Not content with baselessly accusing the band, King recorded his own version of Wild World in the high-energy style of It’s a Sin and released it as a single. Its sleeve ruthlessly parodied the cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ accompanying album Actually. The band sued King for libel, but not before Stevens himself got involved. In a decade known for excess and silliness, few stories were as downright odd as this. “There are a lot of very strange episodes in the wonderful world of pop, but I do remember this,” recalls Barry McIlheney, who was editor of Smash Hits at the time. “The Pet Shop Boys were flying high. The two records didn’t sound particularly alike to me. If you’re going to claim that It’s a Sin is based on Wild World then I don’t know where you begin with a lot of others.” In the summer of 1987 the Pet Shop Boys were on a roll. Their debut album, Please, had been a commercial success the previous year and had spawned their first number one single, West End Girls. It’s a Sin was the first single from the follow-up studio album, Actually. Speaking to Smash Hits (a magazine where he coincidentally used to work) in August 1987, Tennant seemed genuinely surprised at It’s a Sin’s chart success. “I didn’t expect It’s a Sin to get to number one. We always expect our records to be huge, disastrous flops. So I was thrilled to pieces. Two number ones – it’s a proper thing. Have one number one and you’re a one-hit wonder. But have two…,” the singer said. Just as the Pet Shop Boys were enjoying this first flush of fame as copper-bottomed “proper” pop stars, King sought to dislodge their crown. Jonathan King was at the time a famously outspoken character in the British music world. (He was jailed in 2001 for child sex offences). He’d been a singer himself and had seen success with a song called Everyone’s Gone to the Moon in 1965. He’d then become a producer, discovering Genesis, and founded his own record label, UK Records. By the mid-1980s, King had become a well-known broadcaster and media commentator with a regular pop column in The Sun newspaper. And it was to The Sun’s four million readers that King made his claims about the Pet Shop Boys’ alleged plagiarism. “When It’s a Sin went to number one Jonathan King wrote about it in his column in The Sun, suggesting they had committed an act of theft from Cat Stevens and that they should by punished for it,” recalled Chris Heath in his 1990 Pet Shop Boys’ biography, Literally. Other newspapers picked up the allegation, with one journalist contacting Stevens­ – who by then had converted to the Muslim faith and changed his name to Yusuf Islam – for a comment. The singer told the reporter that he wasn’t bothered. But when King repeated the plagiarism claim on the radio, Tennant and bandmate Chris Lowe instigated defamation proceedings. Recalling the events in his diary, Tennant wrote: “One of the most ancient clichés of the music business is ‘Where there’s a hit, there’s a writ’. In 1987 Jonathan King announced on the radio and in his column in The Sun that It’s a Sin was copied from Cat Stevens’ Wild World. We ended up starting to sue King for libel.” It would be reasonable to assume that anyone making a plagiarism claim would have piped down once legal proceedings had been initiated and after the writer of the song alleged to have been copied had shrugged the issue off. Not King. He doubled down. In a hubristic attempt to support his claims, King recorded a single of Wild World to It’s a Sin’s arrangement, down to the choral chants, the thunder clap, the pulsating disco beat and the synth hook. King’s opening vocal lines of ‘Now that I’ve lost everything to you / You say you wanna start something new’ were delivered in a staccato style that mimicked Tennant’s ‘When I look back upon my life / It’s always with a sense of shame.’ As King approached the chorus, he mashed-up the two songs he was conflating. ‘It’s a / It’s a / It’s a / It’s a Wild World,’ he sang. Things got stranger in the spoken-word breakdown (the bit in the original that begins ‘Father forgive me’). King changed the words to: ‘Stevens forgive them / They don’t know what they’re doing / So now they are suing.’ He goes on to make what appears to be sexually suggestive remark about the pair. He didn’t stop here. The sleeve of King’s Wild World single featured a pastiche of Tennant and Lowe on the cover of Actually. On the real album, the pair were famously pictured sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in tuxedos looking bored. King’s sleeve used computer trickery to sit him and Stevens next to each other in tuxedos in precisely the same position. The song title was subheaded: ‘Actually, It’s a sin – to steal.’ Just to make sure that his message wasn’t lost, King’s B-side was a medley of the Chiffons’ He’s So Fine with George Harrison’s My Sweet Lord. Back in 1976, Harrison’s song was found by a US judge to have borrowed from The Chiffons’ song when he wrote his own. The ex-Beatle paid damages to the song’s copyright holder. King’s point was as subtle as a sledgehammer. But it didn’t work. The single bombed. Far more importantly, though, repeating the allegations on an actual record did nothing to help King’s case. Listening today, the songs don’t really match. “If anything it weakened his case,” wrote Heath. McIlheney’s recollection of the episode no doubt mirrored the thoughts of many people in the pop world. “I am sure that at the time we would have been very much on Neil’s side. Partly because of his relationship with Smash Hits, partly because the Pet Shop Boys were a fantastic act and partly because Jonathan King would have been regarded with suspicion,” he says. The case took a twist when Islam himself offered to intervene on behalf of the Pet Shop Boys. Tennant recalls: “Yusuf Islam wrote us a very charming letter offering to mediate at one point.” I approached the Pet Shop Boys’ camp, asking for further details of this letter but to no avail. Yet ultimately the Wild World writer’s help wasn’t needed. King settled out of court. At the band’s request he made a donation to the Jefferiss Research Foundation, which researched sexual health and sexually transmitted infections. In diaries published online a few years ago, Tennant likened the case to when guitarist Joe Satriani claimed that Coldplay had copied their song Viva La Vida from a track of his called If I Could Fly. (The case was dismissed by a US judge but it is not known if whether an out-of-court settlement of any kind was made). Tennant noted that Islam had remarked in an interview that the Coldplay song also sounded like one of his from the 1970s. “We hadn’t stolen It’s a Sin from Wild World and I don’t imagine that Chris Martin of Coldplay has copied his song from either Satriani or Stevens. It is possible to write a song based on a strong, logical chord change with a melody line that follows the chord change and so come up with something new that can coincidentally sound like another song which you may never have heard,” Tennant wrote. “For years we used to perform a medley of It’s a Sin and I Will Survive just because the chord changes were so similar.” McIlheney says that the mid-to-late Eighties were a “golden era” for British pop. The “frenetic and relentless” scene was bursting with stars, from stalwarts like the Pet Shop Boys and George Michael to emerging boy bands Bros and Brother Beyond to singers from Stock Aitken Waterman’s ‘Hit Factory’ such as Rick Astley, Mel and Kim, and Kylie Minogue. The industry was awash with money and huge egos. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that things like the It’s a Sin/ Wild World episode should emerge from the melee. The biggest testament to the greatness of the Pet Shop Boys’ song is that it still sounds like a classic 34 years on, whereas the King controversy is largely a forgotten footnote. And yet, we know that the daft cover version lives on in at least one record collection. According to the Pet Shop Boys’ biographer Heath, Chris Lowe bought a copy of King’s record “because he liked it”. Now that really is a sin.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/sinto-steal-pet-shop-boys-hit-single-ignited-music-industrys/
149,The tumultuous final years of Janis Joplin – by her brother and sister,"On August 14 1970,   went home. Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, was holding a 10-year reunion. Joplin rocked up in hippie flares, a scoop-necked T-shirt, a feather boa that she wore as a hat, and her trademark round, colour-tinted sunglasses. At the time, the 27-year-old singer and songwriter was one of the biggest counter-cultural forces in America. An incendiary performer on- and off-stage, she was a hippie style icon and feminist trailblazer who’d made her name on the San Francisco scene as frontwoman with Big Brother and the Holding Company. Her incredible blues range saw her credited as having “The Voice of a Lady Leadbelly”, as the New York Free Press headlined a February 1968 profile. The previous summer Joplin had been one of the star performers at Woodstock, managing to cut through the stoned fug and 2am start time with an earth-shaking performance. As The Who’s Pete Townsend wrote in his memoir, Who I Am: “She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn t at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she d consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.” Indeed. As The Washington Post wrote in April 1968 of her stage persona: “She screams, she stomps, she jumps, she quivers, she flails her arms, she flings her great wild mane like an unbroken pony.” Later that summer of 1970, Joplin would begin work on her second solo album, Pearl, which would feature some of her best-known songs, including her cover of 1963 R&B track Cry Baby and her own (co-written) Mercedes Benz. But before that, there was that detour back to Port Arthur, the small, conservative Texan community in which, as a beatnik-channelling teen rebel, she’d never felt at home. “It was a formal event and it was an awkward fit!” recalls her 72-year-old sister, Laura, laughing. She accompanied Janis, six years her elder, to the reunion, and wore a dialled-back version of her sister’s fabulous freak-out garb. “Everyone else was in straight, middle-class clothing and teased hair. There was a sense they didn’t quite know what to do about her. But in my mind, and in Janis’s, they should have made her attendance and her success one of the central points to celebrate – ‘Look what someone from our high school has achieved!’ “However, the guy running things thought in terms of how many people had law degrees. It was only when the president of the class said, ‘What about Janis Joplin?’ that everyone stood up and applauded. “I think that hurt her feelings. No matter what she did, she could not get applause from her classmates.” Even then, the recognition was miserly. At the reunion, Janis was symbolically gifted a tyre, to represent “that she’d come the farthest”. And that was meant literally. “That’s what I find most insulting,” says Laura, audibly pained 51 years later. “Instead of being the person who had reached the greatest visible recognition in the country, Janis got a tyre for having travelled the longest distance.” Later that same night, the Joplin girls went to see Jerry Lee Lewis play in Port Arthur. Janis was proud to be able to take her little sister backstage to meet the man, part of “a desire to show she had connections with powerful people.” Nonetheless, it was an “unfortunate experience. He couldn’t have been more rude. He looked at me and looked at her and said: ‘You wouldn’t be bad-looking if you weren’t trying to look like your sister.’ The jerk that he is,” Laura says, witheringly. “That really hurt Janis. So she punched him.” Less than three months later, Janis Joplin was dead. Half a century on from her heroin overdose in Hollywood – midway through the Pearl recording sessions – her visceral, moon-shooting, too-close-to-the-sun artistry and personality are opened up in a lavish new book. Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68 is centred on exactly that: Janis’s own scrapbook from those tumultuous two years, the period in which she broke into the international consciousness at 1967’s Monterey Pop Festival and then, the following year, had career-launching US hits with covers of the soul standard Piece of my Heart and George Gershwin’s Summertime. It features newspaper clippings, press photographs, far-out Sixties concert poster art, letters and postcards home, doodles and, in her own handwriting, Janis’s diary entries. “Speaking of England,” begins one 1967 note, “guess who was in town last week – Paul McCartney! (He’s a Beatle.) And he came to see us!!! SIGH.” This ambitious – not to mention pricey – limited-edition book, in part curated by Laura Joplin and her brother Michael, 67, also features pages from an earlier scrapbook, dated 1956 to 1959 and kept by Janis while she was at high school. Alongside those DIY pages are revealing interviews with myriad friends, collaborators, peers and admirers, including Fleetwood Mac, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, friend Kris Kristofferson (with whose song, Me and Bobby McGee, Janis had a posthumous US number one in 1971), and fans Michelle Phillips, Jimmy Page and Chrissie Hynde. To quote the last of these, who saw Janis perform in in Richfield, Ohio, “there was just no one else like her – total rebelliousness, abandon, musical excellence and total connection with everyone in the audience. Pure magic. Everybody loved her. She gave us a voice that was anti-establishment, and I’ve lived by it ever since.” This is a deeply personal, kaleidoscopic, hippie-vivid portrait of a woman finding her way in the world, and a window into the dizzying contours of America in the mid- to late-Sixties. Harder to divine is the darkness inside that compelled Janis to overindulge to the extent that it killed her. As Kristofferson describes her in his afterword, which comes in the form of poem titled Epitaph, this was a woman “born so black and blue”. “Janis’s scrapbook has been a personal family thing for such a long time,” begins her brother Michael, down the line from Arizona, “and we’d all looked at it, and laughed and pointed and wondered and cried. And we never felt like sharing that personal, gut-wrenching family thing. But after a while it became obvious that it was something of not just interest but importance. After keeping it that way for decades, it just seemed the right time to do something with it.” As Laura writes in the introduction, from childhood her big sister was always keen on “logging” her life. “It certainly was a steady part of who she was from early on,” she tells me, speaking on the phone from California. “That may have been a reflection of our mother – she chronicled our lives on photo scrapbooks. Janis’s scrapbook told you a lot about what she valued, what was important to her, what gave her joy. I remember her working on that scrapbook in her bedroom, cutting things out and doodling. So there’s a sense of her vitality whenever I look at it. It feels more alive.” Janis stayed in touch with her family after she moved to the West Coast in pursuit of her musical dreams. Michael remembers that move as “the logical progression. There wasn’t much in our town. If you wanted to work at the oil refinery, that was fine. But our parents supported us – if you wanted make music or art, go for it.” In the talismanic summer of 1967, the family made the long car journey to visit San Francisco and see Janis at home and, as it were, in action. For Laura, who had just graduated from school, and Michael, then 14, it was “mindblowing” to tour Haight-Ashbury with their big sister and see her perform with Big Brother at the Avalon Ballroom. Michael even had a go at manning the concert lighting rig. “I’m a wannabe hippie in every aspect,” says Michael, who now makes a living as a glassblower. “And I was so proud of Janis. Everybody in there treated with us absolute respect. There were all in awe of her, and [to us] they were helpful, respectful and kind: ‘Yeah, come on and do the light show! Watch the dancing! Listen to all this!’ Big Brother showed up, and they and the dancers and the hippie freaks were proud that we were there. They were protective, too. They weren’t just Big Brother – they were big brothers.” For Mr and Mrs Joplin, it was a different experience. “They were totally out of their realm,” remembers Michael, “so they were really uncomfortable. But they could see that something was happening. They were small-town Texas people, so just the city itself was mind-blowing. And, of course, nobody knew at the time that the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco, in that Summer of Love, was changing history. We just knew something was going on, but nobody knew what.” Alongside Janis’s mesmerising appeal as a blistering, unfiltered singer was her expression of raw sexuality. Even in the go-go late Sixties, that set her apart. “Part of [her] force is an open sensuality,” wrote The New York Times in April 1968, “with no tinge of coyness or come-on.” “The sex thing they keep trying to lay on me,” she told the newspaper, “is always in the receiver’s head, which is where it should be. If I turn anyone on that way – great! Because that’s what it’s all about.” But it wasn’t entirely accidental. Michael says his sister was a great “salesperson”, meaning: “She knew how to talk to the press, be available to the press… She was trying to sell the music and herself.” Equally, Laura points out, “There wasn’t a cerebral Janis and a [separate] sexual Janis. Her entirety was an expression of her art, and sexuality was part of that.” Likewise, she adds, her sister’s fashion sense. “Our mother raised us to be creative about we wore. Mother sewed, and she always got us involved with designing the clothes we were wearing. So we were using fashion magazines, going to the store and picking fabric. Both Janis and I sewed and made some of our clothes. Mother thought that was a basic skill that women needed to know. “And Janis just took it farther. She combined that knowledge of fabric and shaping it for your body along with her artistic flair. So it really grew.” The bangles up her forearms, the feathers, beads, headgear and layers “all became a real sense of her – decorating your body as an expression of who you are”. But even from early on, there had been a sense that Janis was overdoing everything. Michael remembers an early visit home when his sister was clearly “strung out”, as he writes in the book. “She was obviously not well. I didn’t really understand what was going on, but she came contrite and wanting something different from what she had. And rightly so – she knew that [she had] some problems. Drugs and alcohol were not treated the same as they are now. People were like: ‘You just have to get your act together and everything’ll be OK.’ That’s what she came back to do, to get healthy and to figure out how to proceed in life in a more rational way. But she didn’t know what that was.” Does he mean strung out on heroin? “Ah, well, I mean… I’m still protective of my sister, so I don’t like saying a lot of that. But she was strung out on drugs, and drinking, and being poor as bejesus, and not eating. She was trying to stay afloat, and not able to.” Nonetheless, her good friend and Big Brother bandmate Dave Getz is quoted in the scrapbook thus: “You can’t talk about Janis without talking about heroin.” “There’s probably some truth in that,” allows Michael. “People have accused me of trying to protect her, and of course I do. But she did heroin. She did massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and she slept around. What am I going to protect her from? So yeah, heroin was definitely involved in her life. She liked to do drugs and alcohol and get laid. What can I say? Everybody did.” In January I interviewed  – who, like Janis, was managed by the fearsome Albert Grossman – and the producer recalled his ultimately ill-fated attempts in early summer 1970 to prepare the groundwork for the recording of Pearl. “I hadn’t worked with an artist like her before,” he told me. “I was very much about the musical aspect, getting everyone together to do a performance in the studio somehow, and not mess around too much with the psychology or play head games. “And Janis, I think, hated making records. She loved playing live. That was her life – to get up in front of an audience, freak out and do her thing. But she was just never comfortable in the studio because there was no audience.” Equally, he added, “she in some ways was like a crazy teenager. She’d suddenly go off on a whim of some kind. I recall being in her house in Mill Valley [near San Francisco], and a bunch of people are coming in with songs for her, and then I get a call in from Janis: ‘I’m gonna be late, I’m at the police station!’ “Five minutes later, I walk past her bedroom, and the door’s open and she’s in there with some guy! She’s calling from her own bedroom, making excuses for not showing up because she doesn’t want to get out of bed with some guy she’s picked up the night before!” Rundgren eventually left the project after recording moved to Los Angeles. As he admits, “it became apparent that I didn’t have the touch to get her to deliver in the studio. But after that they formed a band for her and that helped a lot – she finally had a musical unit she could interact with, and abandon herself to. And they found another producer, Paul Rothchild, whose style was completely different from mine. Mine was: ‘Let’s make some music in here.’ His was: ‘Let’s make everybody feel real good in here, and maybe the music will happen.’” The sessions, though, came to an abrupt halt on October 4 when Janis was found dead in her hotel room. For Mick Fleetwood, who knows of what he speaks, it was a sadly inevitable outcome of the hedonism of the scene. “Yes, she was a child in a toy shop,” he says in Days & Summers, “and it just became too much for her.” “None of us knew what we were doing with drugs – we were young and stupid,” admits Grace Slick. “We were either having a good time with them, or using them to calm down. When you felt bad, you’d go shoot some heroin or drink some alcohol or whatever. Everybody was doing it. Heroin is really tricky, because you only take a small dose and so then you think: ‘Oh, I’ll have a little bit more.’ But a little bit more will kill you.” Her death, terribly, was a sign of the times. “That whole rock star thing caught up with her, as it did with a lot of pop idols in the early Seventies,” says Rundgren of a singer who was an early member of what Kurt Cobain’s grief-stricken mother later called “that stupid club” – musicians who were dead at 27. Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison were all that age when they died between 1969 and 1971. “There was this feeling of invincibility going around,” the producer continues. “Once you’d achieved that stardom, you got giddy. And it was proven several times over that these people weren’t invincible, with Morrison and Hendrix and Joplin all dropping like flies.” But it was, of course, also an awful family tragedy. When the news came, Laura was in Dallas, where she’d begun graduate school. She was at home alone in her shared apartment. “It was very difficult,” she says now, “to be surrounded by silence when internally I was very empty.” Michael was at home in Port Arthur. The call came in the middle of the night, and his father woke him in the morning. “He could barely get the words out. He said, ‘Your sister’s dead’, then he had to leave the room, because he was gonna lose it. “What was really weird was that I wanted to go tell somebody, and have that conversation with my best friend: ‘My sister passed away.’ But he already knew. ‘How did you know?’ ‘It was on the radio.’ That was my first taste that I didn’t have any [private] family thing about this. And my parents were not able to deal with that at all. It was so talked about – it was on the national freaking news!” In fact, so was Michael. When his parents travelled to California to make the arrangements, they left him at home. “They were afraid to have me part of that scene, which I understand. But they also didn’t realise that Dan Rather was going to call the house. And I’m there, waiting for them to call, so I answer the phone and I’m 17, talking to Dan Rather on the nightly news! We were just unaware of what was going to be transpiring. “That was a really hard time,” he continues. “My idol was dead. And it was tough. Mostly, if you ever lose a family member, they go away. And your memories are what keep them alive in you. But with this, I’m talking to you 50 years after – it’s crazy, a weird thing. You’ve got your perceptions of Janis, I have mine, and I can’t change everyone else’s.” Given the cultural lionisation – and the tearing down – of various Sixties and Seventies musical legends in the decades since, it’s remarkable that there’s been no film of the life of Janis Joplin. That’s not for the want of trying, notes Michael. Over the years, multiple actresses have been linked to the role, including Pink, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams and Courtney Love. “There’s been a lot of people in the talk, and until it happens, it’s only all talk. For a long time I was holding my breath, then I gave up because I started turning blue. Now I’m like, if you want to do it, you better come to me with something real. Until then, it’s just BS. It’s Hollywood, man. I have a drawer full of scripts!” But nothing that he and Laura thought was up to snuff? “We didn’t stop anything. We have never said no to anybody. I would love to have had Pink involved. But things just don’t happen – the funding fell through, or whatever. It’s just that kind of stuff. I’m not an a--hole or anything. If they can figure out how to make it happen, we’ll support them, if it’s good.” For Laura, looking after her sister’s memory – the family have been careful not to overexploit her legacy – “helped me heal a lot. Talking with people, feeling the incredible love they have for her, really helped me get more anchored. In that regard it’s a pleasure to listen and hear what she meant to people.” Also, she points out, for all the sense of a depressed and doom-laden mythos that’s attended her sister in subsequent years, “the thing that can sometimes be overlooked is: she was so much fun to be around. Janis was a high-energy girl who had an unending curiosity.” Or, as Janis said to Eye magazine in June 1968: “I have at least a thousand people inside of me and I don’t know which is the real me.” Those qualities are all over the deluxe, coffee-table pages of Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68. Immerse yourself in the mind and soul and chaos of Joplin’s too-short life and career, and you understand why her siblings might still want their sister’s story told on screen, but told right. “There’s been a lot of powerful woman that wanted to portray her,” says Michael, “because Janis is a perfect story in every aspect. It’s like Shakespeare.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/tumultuous-final-years-janis-joplin-brother-sister/

As a metaphor for the immigrant experience, it’s both picturesque and sturdily no-nonsense, which is also a neat summing-up of Chung’s breakthrough feature overall.  Though Minari will be made available to cinemas when they reopen next month, its status as a major contender in the current awards season make a lockdown release a no-brainer. So here it is, available to rent and stream at home one week before the Baftas, at which it’s in the running for six prizes – then another six at the Oscars, two weeks after that. Fortunately, it’s performed and crafted with a tenderness that lends itself to small-screen viewing – it’s the kind of film that’s attuned to the small, here-and-now details of its characters’ lives, from the stickiness of old wooden drawers to the wisps of steam that rise from freshly ploughed ground. Heavily inspired by its director’s own upbringing in rural Arkansas in the 1980s, it follows a Korean family who are putting down roots into what father Jacob (Steven Yeun) hopefully describes as “the best dirt in America”: a five-acre plot of Ozark grassland which he hopes to develop into a farm 10 times that size. Jacob’s wife Monica (Yeri Han) is less optimistic, and her fears are hardly allayed when she sets eyes on their new house, which resembles a large Kit-Kat finger on wheels, held in place by breeze blocks. “Don’t be like that,” her husband says reassuringly, before hoisting her up and across the chest-height threshold. After all, the couple and their preposterously angelic offspring, seven-year-old David (Alan Kim) and his older sister Anne (Noel Cho), have much to be getting on with. There’s a well to dig, a field to till and plant, locals to befriend, plus a spare room to make up for Monica’s elderly mother Soonja (Youn Yuh-jung), a tough old bird who’s flying in from Korea to – theoretically – help out. Minari is a multi-generational affair, but Chung keeps it earthed to young David’s perspective, with most scenes bathed in the kind of crisp, honeyed light in which our vivid childhood memories so often seem to unfold. Both David and Anne are keenly aware – at least in a broad, innocent sense – of the pressure this make-or-break project is putting on their parents’ marriage, and during a night-time argument the pair make paper aeroplanes with “don’t fight” scrawled in crayon on their flanks, then send them gliding into the living room.  Small, seemingly formative experiences feel just right – such as the moment during a walk in the woods when David spots a snake and tries to shoo it away, before his grandmother warns him that hidden dangers pose a far greater threat than the ones slithering past in plain sight. David himself has a heart murmur, which is a further source of anxiety for his parents, and also one of perhaps a smidge too many symbolically loaded subplots that the ostensibly low-key narrative keeps diligently spinning away. The cast’s performances are all so beautifully observed that you may end up wishing the film had given their characters a few more moments of quiet: one of the most purely enjoyable scenes unfolds in the aftermath of a local church service, where the children uneasily strike up some friendships, Monica makes small talk, Jacob looks on awkwardly, and Soonja unsubtly marvels at the natives’ girth. This elderly lady represents the old country at its most irrepressible – and David, the first American-born member of the clan, and with the little cowboy boots to show it, doesn’t appreciate what he impudently describes as her “Korean smells”.  Meanwhile in the middle, Jacob and Monica find themselves at the tipping point between two very different existences, and while the film’s style is melodrama-averse, we’re left in no doubt of exactly how much is at stake. Yeun is especially good: a movie star-in-the-making who was last seen in the spectacular 2018 neo-noir Burning, he winningly captures Jacob’s good-humoured stoicism, then cuts through it with flashes of frustration and despair that make you ache on his behalf. A fiery dramatic climax feels a little conventional and over-engineered, but that’s partly because the story told in Minari is all beginning – the opening chapter of an American immigrant epic which goes otherwise untold. That delicately kindled open-endedness is what keeps Chung’s film turning over in your own memory. Long after the land itself has been settled, the settling in goes on.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/minari-review-gentle-restoration-faith-american-dream/
151,"Godzilla vs Kong, review: exactly the loud, trashy mayhem we’ve been missing this year","Forget the   and   contenders. No film has made me ache more for the reopening of cinemas in May than this trashily sublime, visual-effects-driven blare-a-thon, in which a king-sized gorilla and a radioactive lizard settle their differences over the smoking remains of a city or two.  For those of us who have spent much of the last 13 months pining for a bit of big-screen spectacle, this latest instalment in Legendary Pictures’ MonsterVerse franchise arrives like a naughty WhatsApp message from an old flame.  , it purrs, while coyly flattening a skyscraper, or sending a spaceship through a rainbow-coloured wormhole.  , it adds, with a winking, kiss-blowing emoji.  It’s hard while watching Godzilla vs Kong not to wish that you were seeing it projected in towering proportions (in countries where cinemas are currently open, including China, the film has already taken £90 million). But on a large enough television, it still delivers the kind of base, brain-dazing pleasures that the average Best Screenplay contender couldn’t hope to match. As the fourth instalment in an ongoing series, there is no standing or stomping on ceremony here: no fleeting, partial glimpses of the film’s title characters before jumbo-scale mayhem ensues. The film opens on Kong himself, who is trying to break free from a Truman Show-style compound, and then brings us up to speed with his scaly rival, who’s laying waste to the Florida coast.  In the previous MonsterVerse instalments, Godzilla was something of a heroic figure, fending off an assortment of giant winged and clawed threats. But this latest unprompted attack signals an apparent shift in loyalties, so an operation gets underway to bring the creature to heel. This is masterminded by Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir), the chief executive of a deeply sinister cybernetics corporation, and it involves a Jules Verne-like voyage to a hidden subterranean realm, where lies the only power source on the planet capable of subduing the beast. The expedition is led by geologist Nathan Lind ( ), but its whopping sherpa is Kong himself – coaxed into service by Rebecca Hall’s doe-eyed primatologist and her deaf adopted daughter (Kaylee Hottle), who has managed to teach the big lug some basic sign-language.  A few more supporting players are scuttling around other subplots, including Millie Bobby Brown’s spunky teenage activist, returning from 2019’s  , and Brian Tyree Henry’s conspiracy-mongering podcaster, who suspects – correctly, would you believe – that the brandy-swirling, velvet-jacket-wearing Bichir may, in fact, be up to no good. (To be specific, he and his company are preparing the way for the only classic Godzilla-adjacent monster yet to appear in the series.) But such weedy mortals are only really present for the sake of scale, and aren’t given much to do but cower and gawp.  Every plot development in Godzilla vs Kong is in service of viewer bedazzlement, and every shot calibrated for maximum neon-kitsch impact. Take the descent into the underground valley, which involves flying a hi-tech craft through some kind of gravity-reversing portal which causes reality to bend and strobe. Why? Because it allows director Adam Wingard and the visual effects team at Weta Digital to stage a hallucinatory light-show in the style of the Star Gate sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey – and frankly, that’s reason enough.  Godzilla’s various Hollywood outings have typically been less keen to capitalise on their scaly protagonist’s knack for outsize allegory than the best of the Japanese productions, which have reflected over the years on everything from that nation’s postwar terror of nuclear holocaust to the devastation wrought by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami (in the highly recommended Shin Godzilla, from 2016).  But there’s no shame in shallowness carried off with this degree of showmanship. The scraps between Kong and Godzilla themselves are always energetic, stylish and surprising – the twosome even develop some chemistry, of a mostly roar-based sort – while the film’s impressive willingness to throw both caution and taste to the wind results in some thrilling passages of pure junk spectacle. I especially loved the scene where Kong lumbers into a vast and ancient ceremonial hall miles beneath the Earth’s crust, and wearily plonks himself on the throne, surveying the ruins of what was presumably a giant gorilla civilisation of the past.  The danger now, of course, is that the franchise will loop back to fill in the gap, and give us an entry on the downfall of the Kong royal bloodline, with violence, scandal, treachery, and an ill-advised interview on Newsnight with a 50-storey Emily Maitlis. Yet the image is so bizarre, so grandiose, so imagination-spinningly suggestive, that it would be a pity to explain it away. Some backstories are best left un-grunted.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/godzilla-vs-kong-review-exactly-loud-trashy-mayhem-missing-year/
152,"The dark side of George Formby, a ‘dirty little Northern would-be Casanova’"," still holds the record as Britain’s youngest professional jockey, making his debut at Lingfield Park in 1915, when he was just 10. For the remainder of the First World War, he raced in Ireland. His father invested in a prize horse called Philander for his son to ride. It would turn out to be a strangely prescient name: Formby kept his lecherous private life secret from a public who made him Britain’s most adored showbusiness star of the era. Formby, who raced under his birth name George Hoy Booth, quit racing after his 45-year-father died of pulmonary tuberculosis in February 1921, shortly after collapsing during a pantomime performance in Newcastle. The teenage Formby quickly decided to follow in his late father’s vaudevillian footsteps, copying parts of his act and adding his own skits as a  entertainer who sang minstrel songs and told jokes about parrots. His huge public popularity came later, when he finally invented his own popular persona as the cheeky ukulele-playing ‘Lancashire Toreador’. Now, 60 years after Formby’s death, it is hard to overstate the level of celebrity the singer-songwriter from Wigan achieved in the mid-20th century. His most famous record, Leaning On a Lamp-post, sold 150,000 copies in just over a fortnight in 1937. The public just could not get enough of him. Formby made 20 films between 1934 and 1946, when he was British cinema’s leading attraction. The contract he signed with Columbia Pictures in 1941 made him higher-paid than Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn and  . “He used to get about £35,000 a film – by modern standards that’s about £1,500,000. He was big time,” said lifelong fan Frank Skinner. The major turning point in his early career came in September 1924, when he married “Lancashire lass” Beryl Ingham, a tenacious clog-dancing champion – a skill that had a poignancy, given that Formby hated the anti-Northern nickname ‘Cloggy’ he’d been saddled with as a youngster by Epsom stable boys. She was four years older than Formby and exerted a controlling influence from the start. Formby later described their tumultuous, largely sexless marriage, as a “living hell”. Although she guided his career expertly, astutely directing him to build his act around his ukulele performances, even though he could only play in one key and was unable to read music, she was deeply unpopular on the circuit. Actress Irene Handl called Beryl “a nasty, spiteful, twisted, conniving piece of work”, while Betty Driver, who acted with Formby as a teenager and went on to find fame as a barmaid in Coronation Street, described her as “a monstrous woman”. Beryl shaped his stage image as the good-natured, gormless northerner, always happy to play the clown. He even approved a line in a film describing him as having “a face like a horse and a row of teeth like a graveyard”, and made his buck-toothed grinning shtick his selling point. On screen, his awkwardness around young women became a Formby specialty; his moments of rising panic in any romantic scenario usually punctuated by a yelped cry of his catchphrase, “Ooooh, Mother!”. People loved his squeaky-clean image as much as his squeaky voice. Actor Timothy Spall, who recreated Formby in his 2016 film Stanley, A Man of Variety, is among those who identified a disturbing hidden quality that Formby shared with other great entertainers of his era, including Max Wall and Noël Coward. “Beneath the appearance of cosy fun and jollity,” remarked Spall, “there was something sinister about their affability.” Although Beryl kept a lid on the darker parts of the Formby story, some of the elements, including her own affairs with young actors, came to light in David Bret’s 1999 biography George Formby: A Troubled Genius, the most explicit of the five biographies of Formby. “Beryl had her young men; he had his leading ladies,” said the author in an interview. Bret’s book sparked outrage among the legions of the entertainer’s fans – who call themselves Formbyites – especially diehard members of The George Formby Society, which was founded in the aftermath of the entertainer’s death in 1961. In July 1999, in an editorial in The George Formby Newsletter, the society reacted angrily to the salacious biography, admitting it could be “very damaging” to the society’s image. “Bret’s controversial book condemns George as a womanising drug addict who had leanings toward homosexuals and sympathy towards Hitler. Beryl was classed as a drunkard, a bag and a cow who had a string of affairs,” the editorial said. To add insult to injury, the society reported that Bret had dismissed their members as a bunch “who walk round wielding Zimmer frames and ukuleles”. As well as highlighting old family skeletons – including the story that Formby’s grandmother had been a sex worker in Ashton-under-Lyne and that his father George Formby Snr was a bigamist – Bret revealed the extent of Formby’s womanising with dancers and chorus girls, describing how Beryl flew into drunken rages when she heard about Formby’s philandering. When Formby had an affair with Kay Walsh in 1937, on the set of Keep Fit, Beryl tried to have the young actress removed from the production. When director Anthony Kimmins refused, Formby’s wife went to producer Basil Dean and asked him to have Walsh made look less appealing on screen, fitted out in dowdy frocks and given an unflattering haircut. Walsh, who married director David Lean three years later, apparently fell for Formby’s “charming flirtation”. Although the public believed in the image of ‘Good old George’, his seedy reputation among the acting fraternity was well known. “He screwed like a tiger until dawn,” Bret said in 1999. “Whenever we did a film with him, it would go round the girls’ grapevine: ‘He’ll make passes at you.’ He couldn’t resist trying to make it with all his leading ladies,” said Phyllis Calvert, Formby’s co-star in the 1940 film Let George Do It. Florence Desmond, who was Formby’s leading lady in the mid-1930’s films No Limit and Keep Your Seats, Please, even branded Formby “a dirty little man” and a “dirty little Northern would-be Casanova”.   was a fan of Formby – he chose his song Auntie Maggie’s Remedy as one of his Desert Island Discs choices – and the jazz singer was told by a friend of his actress sister Andrée that it was common knowledge on the northern theatre circuit that Formby would try to seduce dance girls by saying “‘Eee, I’m crazy about you” before offering them, with a wink, the chance to “play with my ukulele”. Sarah Gregory, star of Zip Goes a Million, said Formby used inappropriate physical contact during filming. Formby’s behaviour would have attracted #MeToo publicity in the modern era, but at the time actresses could not risk exposing such a powerful star. The 21-year-old Googie Withers, 14 years younger than Formby when they made Trouble Brewing in 1939, recalled years later that Formby took advantage of a scene in which they fell into a vat of beer to touch her up. “Because we were in water, my skirt had ridden up. He had his hand on my bare thigh and he kept it there and started to kiss me… Beryl was in on it like a flash screaming ‘cut, cut!’” It seems that many of Formby’s female co-stars were obliged to be part of the weird psychodrama of the Formby marriage. Formby’s sexual harassment usually occurred as part of a game of evading the hawk eye of Beryl. Perhaps the strangest of all Formby’s adulterous liaisons was with a chanteuse who went by the stage name of Yana, an affair that began in June 1960, when Formby was top-of-the-bill in a revue at the Queen’s Theatre in Blackpool. Formby was 56 and Yana was 29 at the time. Although Yana’s name hinted at an exotic background, the singer was in fact called Pamela Guard, a former hairdresser’s assistant from Billericay in Essex. She was famous enough to merit inclusion in the 1998 Daily Telegraph Third Book of Obituaries: Entertainers, which described her as “blatantly lesbian”. Formby, it seems, was unaware of her bisexuality, even though she was also living with an American actress at the time. Their affair, which came when Beryl’s alcoholism had started spiralling out of control as she battled leukaemia, was apparently torrid. It prompted a memorably lurid exchange in Bret’s stage play Our George: The George Formby Story: A Play in 2 Acts, during a scene in which Yana is helping Formby get out of his Mr Wu Chinese costume, after one of their shows in Blackpool. “George, would you like to stick it between my t__s again?” Brett has Yana ask Formby. It’s a far cry from Formby’s innocent movie naïveté displays. Bret, who has written biographies of Joan Crawford, Maurice Chevalier and Morrissey, also angered Formby fans with other revelations. Before he became a writer, Bret worked as an NHS administrator in Yorkshire, where he gained access to Formby’s medical records. Among the information he divulged in the book was highly personal detail about the singer’s time in a psychiatric hospital in York, where he was treated for depression and “morphine addiction”. Another controversy in the book concerned the time in 1944 Formby was supposedly investigated by the Home Office’s Dance Music Policy Committee over sympathies to Hitler, a period Formby referred to as “a nightmare”. There were claims that his song Swim Little Fish supposedly mocked the effort against the German U-boats, which were at the time sinking British convoys in the Atlantic. The investigation was rumoured to have been instigated by a jealous actor. In any case, the pro-Hitler charge seems ludicrously far-fetched. Formby was held in high regard by the government and his devotion to the war effort seems clear. He worked as a dispatch rider for the Home Guard and went on numerous overseas tours to entertain British troops, always reminding them that “it’s wonderful to be British”. In addition, the dream sequence in his movie Let George Do It, in which he descends from a balloon in the middle of a Nazi rally to punch Adolf Hitler in the face, was judged in a survey from The Mass Observation Project to have been “the biggest morale-booster of the Second World War.” It’s highly likely that Formby would not have been able to explain himself adroitly in a nuanced argument about lyrics. He was deeply self-conscious about having left school at the age of seven and never having learned to read or write properly. His lack of intellect was sometimes cruelly mocked by his fellow actors. Desmond said of Formby that “the man’s as thick as two very short planks”, while actress Pat Kirkwood, described him as “a cretinous little creature”, adding that “if you tried to converse with him, you’d find there was no one at home”. Although Formby had his detractors, he also had his high-profile fans. And none more elevated than Queen Elizabeth. The Queen’s parents were both Formby fans. He sang before King George VI at the 1937 Royal Variety Performance, and the king sent him a letter saying his family had been “convulsed with laughter” at Formby’s 1938 film It’s in the Air. He was later invited to give a private show at Windsor, which was watched by the young future monarch and her sister Princess Margaret. In 2003, for his book about the Queen, Gyles Brandreth interviewed Deborah Bean, Her Majesty’s long-serving Correspondence Secretary. “During our conversation Mrs Bean revealed to me that the Queen had once told her that she loved the songs of George Formby, knew all of them, could sing them – and frequently did.” There were even reports that she once asked to be president of the George Formby Appreciation Society, although no corroboration of this exists. In 2018, at a special Royal Albert Hall concert to celebrate the Queen’s 92nd birthday, the monarch was particularly delighted when Skinner, Harry Hill and Ed Balls joined members of The George Formby Society to deliver a version of When I’m Cleaning Windows, the Peeping Tom-style song about a man who spies on women undressing. The song was once banned as “not fit to be broadcast” by BBC chairman Lord Reith, who dismissed it as “a disgusting little ditty”. A lot of Formby’s songs were innuendo-filled, including You Can't Keep a Growing Lad Down, With My Little Ukulele in My Hand and With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock, which was also banned by the BBC for its smutty double-entendres. My Little Snapshot Album contained risqué lines for 1938:  Formby was a witty songwriter – Our Sergeant Major is a fine example of war-time satire – and he attracted other influential fans too, including comedian Peter Sellers, who could do an uncanny impression of the Lancashire singer. Sellers praised Formby as “a terrific performer” and the ukulele man’s songs have been performed by Bill Haley, Richard Thompson and Lonnie Donegan.  was also a fan – paying tribute by including Formby’s iconic line “it’s turned out nice again” in his song Free as A Bird – while fellow Beatle  was such a devotee that he bought the gold-plated banjolele ukulele that Formby used in live performances. Beryl is often the butt of a story that claimed she limited Formby to a weekly allowance of five-shillings of pocket money in their early days, but once he made it big, he spent a fortune on cars and houses. Formby bought more than a hundred luxury cars in his most successful years, including 26 Rolls-Royces with personalised number plates. Then there were the properties. In the early 1950s, Formby bought a lavish 24-room mansion at Foxrock, outside Dublin, telling a reporter who spotted him in the estate agent office that “I’m sick to death of the taxman robbing me of 90 per cent of my earnings.” Some of his fortune came from lucrative foreign tours, including an eventful one in 1946 to South Africa, when he played to black audiences, despite angry complaints from Daniël François Malan, head of the National Party and the future prime minister who was one of the chief architects of apartheid two years later. When Beryl kissed a young black girl who presented Formby with a box of chocolates, Malan sought the couple out to shout at them. “Why don’t you piss off, you horrible little man?” replied Beryl. They were ordered out of the country, never to return. By the late 1950s, life was becoming more difficult for the couple, despite the opulence of their home in Fairhaven, Lytham, which was originally called Cintra, but which Formby’s wife immediately renamed as ‘Beryldene’. Formby was closer to his dog Willie Waterbucket than he was to wife. Although Formby had been warned to take it easy after his heart attack in 1949, he was still smoking 40 Capstan Full Strength and Woodbine cigarettes a day – cheerfully calling them his “coffin nails” – and eating lots of beef-dripping toast. As Beryl’s cancer worsened she sought solace in drinking, sometimes consuming a bottle of whisky a day. She was 59 when she died on Christmas Day 1960. Beryl’s illness had allowed him free access to conduct the affair with Yana, but when that ended – and with work now intermittent – Formby turned his attention to a local woman called Pat Howson. Formby was a friend of her father Fred (who as general manager of Loxhams Car Showroom in Preston had sold him cars) and Formby sometimes took the Howson family on holiday on his boat on the Norfolk broads. Pat Howson, then 35, taught religious education and was sympathetic when Formby told her that Beryl, an atheist, “tried to turn me away from my Catholic religion”. In February 1961, they announced their engagement. “I first met her when she was nine, just a pretty little schoolgirl in ringlets,” 56-year-old Formby told The Daily Mirror. He said they reunited after his wife’s death and after a fortnight of courting he “popped the question”. Just two days before the wedding, on March 6 1961, Formby died of heart failure. The aftermath of his death was engulfed in rancour. Formby’s mother Eliza vetoed Howson’s funeral arrangements and had her son buried in Warrington instead of Preston. Although Formby left almost all his £2.2 million estate to Howson, his 82-year-old mother took the matter to court, reportedly saying her family would “fight that little floozy schoolma’am with their last breath”. The legal battle lasted nearly a decade before a compromise was reached. The money seemed cursed, however. Howson died of ovarian cancer in 1971, aged just 46. Eliza lived on until 1981, when she died at 102. The 150,000 fans who lined the 20-mile route of Formby’s funeral procession knew little of the truth about Formby’s life. They simply loved one of their own, a man who admitted that, “I’m just a clown without the make-up, the circus clown who magnifies the reactions of ordinary people to the things that happen around them.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/dark-side-george-formby-dirty-little-northern-would-be-casanova/
153,Black Crowes interview: ‘We're the last of the trouble-makers’,"Following the breakup of the Black Crowes, on the penultimate day of 2014 the group’s front man, Chris Robinson, played a concert for a thousand people at the Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom, in Denver. Trading under the name the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, the band were on the road in a van; not just this, they were setting up their own equipment, too. They had to – the singer needed the money.  Interested parties looked on askance. In his deliciously vengeful memoir Hard To Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes, the group’s erstwhile drummer Steve Gorman writes that, “Chris seems to think that singing Black Crowes songs on occasion with a pickup band is in some way meaningful, but it’s dubious to suggest those shows are about anything beyond financial desperation.” Remarkable, really. In the final 10 years of the 21st Century, the Black Crowes sold somewhere in the region of 15-million albums. Re-issued last week in expanded form, the Atlanta quintet’s debut LP, Shake Your Money Maker, from 1990, found an audience of five million people in the United States alone. A year before Nirvana gatecrashed the mainstream, the “Crowes” were the first wholly credible international rock success story of the decade.  “All that record sales money, that’s long gone,” Chris Robinson tells me. On the line from his home in Colorado, about this the 54 year old sounds not all bothered. “We weren’t taken care of in that way at all. I’m not a person who’s very savvy with his finances. My wife knows that, my kids know that, we’re all good. Sometimes just doing things for money is like the most boring and worst thing. You can just see it in a band you love sometimes. No matter where they are in their career, when they just dial it in for the money there’s a light that goes out.” The quote is instructive. Wedded to honourable notions of artistic purity – as far back as 1992, the singer was bemoaning record executives “who call music ‘product’” – with tracks such Remedy, Sometimes Salvation and My Morning Song the Georgians were once giants. With better lines of communication, and with better advice, as with Pearl Jam they might have become an enduring stadium-sized worldwide institution. Instead, dependably fractious they proved capable of cocking up  .   On rhythm guitar the group’s line-up featured Rich Robinson, the singer’s younger brother. Today reunited as a two-man band, following the second of the Black Crowes’ two breakups, in 2014, the siblings didn’t speak for six years. The fracture occurred after Chris Robinson demanded a larger share of the money. “There will be no negotiation or wriggle-room when it comes to the percentages below,” the band were told, via email. Asked about this today, in mitigation the front man says that “I felt that the only way to make [the band] stop would be to ask for the one thing that I knew no one would go for”.  “As a family, the Robinsons aren’t good communicators anyway,” Rich Robinson tells me. “No one ever wanted to address [something that] had just happened. So it was easier for us to pretend that it didn’t happen and just keeping moving on. But ultimately it comes down to communication and transparency… [otherwise] you don’t talk for months and you’re onstage resenting the sh*t out of someone who’s your partner. How can you be in a band like that? How does that even work? The answer is you can’t, and it doesn’t, ultimately.” The Robinsons were merely the latest in a long-line of quarrelsome rock siblings. On the road with  , in 1996, the two groups titled their co-headline campaign The Tour Of Brotherly Love. Mark Lanegan, the singer with opening band Screaming Trees, arranged to have a fistfight with Liam Gallagher after the final date, in Miami (the concert was cancelled). Asked today, Rich Robinson recalls the rambunctious caravan as being “one of the most fun tours that I can remember”. “The two groups had a kinship because we’re two stubborn-ass brothers from Atlanta who would tell people to f*** off, and they were two stubborn-ass brothers from Manchester who would also tell people to f*** off,” he says. “So there was a mutual respect there.” As different as chalk and spaceships, in the days when he was spending $100,000 per annum on cannabis Chris Robinson married movie star Kate Hudson. Cocaine and (on occasion) heroin was also stirred into the mix. Three years his junior, crippled by anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Rich Robinson remained abstinent. “Drugs tapped into every fear and anxiety that I ever had, so I stayed away from them,” he says.  “I had some moments with drugs, but I knew where I was,” Chris Robinson says. “I knew what I was doing. There were a few times in the late Nineties, or a certain period in the Nineties, where depression just got a hold of me, but… for the most part I had an amazing time. It is what it is, I’m not ashamed. Back then I didn’t have children; I didn’t have responsibilities to anyone else. It’s as if I was a completely different being back then.” In 1990, the Black Crowes came out of nowhere. Signed by producer George Drakoulias to Rick Rubin’s Def American label (now American Recordings), in Atlanta the group’s name would draw crowds of fewer than a hundred people. In lieu of a local following, or anything like a buzz, instead they had a berth on a fast-emerging maverick imprint that would soon be recognised as one of the most fearless in North America. Green they may have been, but suddenly the Crowes shared a roster with Slayer, the Geto Boys, Danzig and the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Released on February 13 1990, to the casual ear Shake Your Money Maker was simply a persuasive mélange of classic Seventies American rock and The Faces without the boorishness. But within the grooves there was something deeper, and more sinuous. Forget Rod the Mod, the Black Crowes learned their most important lessons at the feet of punk bands such as The Replacements and X. Seeing REM play Aerosmith’s Toys In The Attic at the Fox Theater, in Atlanta, Rich Robinson thought, “I want .”  It was more than lip service, too. After Chris Robinson (not for the first time) criticised ZZ Top’s decision to allow the Miller Brewing Company to sponsor their live campaign, following a hometown show at the Omni the Georgians were bounced from the opening slot on tour. Speaking to MTV, Robinson explained that “I can see them being defensive about corporate sponsorship. But we’re not sponsored by anyone. We’re the Black Crowes.” There was plenty more where that came from. Spoiling for a scrap, when Tower Records offered to hoist a Black Crowes promotional flag on the roof of their iconic store, on Sunset Boulevard, the band insisted it fly at half mast. “It’s a symbolic gesture that says to all the people in the capital of the music industry that we’re in mourning for the death of rock’n’roll,” Chris Robinson told the writer Max Bell, in 1991. “Think about that instead of what’s in the charts and all the demographic bullsh*t.” Unencumbered by anhedonia, other members of the band were not quite so enamored of their singer’s tireless crusade to start a fight in every empty room in the world. With a clearly delineated hierarchy – the Robinsons wrote all the songs – Gorman, bassist Johnny Colt and lead guitarist Marc Ford, who joined in 1991, tended to regard their singer’s expectorations with a mixture of weariness and irritation. Gaining a taste for the trappings of fame, some people just wanted to rock.  “The second we got some success there were certain people who wanted to play it safe,” says Chris Robinson, unrepentant to the last. “They’d say, ‘Oh we’ve got a big tour, man, and we’ve got mortgages to pay’. Well I’m not here to pay your f****** mortgage, man. I’m here to sop up all these experiences like a big piece of French bread with some nice gravy. Those guys knew that when they met me. Especially back then, when the world was wild and rock’n’roll was a thing, you know.” If the Black Crowes appeared temperamentally unsuited to fame, who wouldn’t be? In the year before alternative music turned the mainstream upside down, Chris Robinson’s barbed mouth was seen by many as evidence of chippiness, or ingratitude. In 2021 the singer still says things like “you don’t want to get a whiff of the corporate f****** assholes of the music industry”; 30 years earlier, quintuple platinum he was simply another newbie millionaire left alone to deal with the consequences of life-changing success.  “It was a shock,” is how Rich Robinson describes the music industry’s most glaring deficiency. “None of us were ever taught how to handle success. There was no manual. We were just left on our own to deal with things. And that comes into play when we’re talking about drama and how we handled ourselves. We did the best we could, but it was definitely shocking. This thing fell in our laps.” On record, the Black Crowes were a world-class group for barely two years. Released in 1992, then and now the band’s second album, The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion, is rightly regarded as a capstone of American rock music. Recorded in only nine days, the organic masterpiece found its authors in altitudinous form. As well as this, Def American’s rookie error in failing to exercise the option for a second record before the deadline for doing so elapsed meant that the group were able to renegotiate their royalty rate to a level befitting their superstar status. Long story short, it went to their heads. Costing $600,000, the band’s third album, Amorica, itself no dud – and it ought not to have been, it was recorded twice – tiptoed uneasily into a domestic scene dominated by Green Day and The Offspring. By now it was like Lynyrd Skynyrd trying to look hip at a party thrown by the Buzzcocks. Having survived the grunge revolution, by 1994 the Black Crowes were no longer hungry insurrectionists. Crabby as ever, instead they looked old before their time.    Inevitably, they toured themselves into the ground. Often obdurate, usually intense, occasionally boring, come the latter part of the Nineties the Crowes were as powerful and precise a musical unit as any on the circuit. But for all their nuance and finesse, Steve Gorman’s observation that “[Oasis] struck me as a ‘great songs, good band’ kind of a band, whereas I thought that [we] were often a ‘great band, good songs’ kind of a band” is piercingly true.  “The history of rock music shows quite clearly that the former succeeds far more than the latter,” he writes.   “I think our main mistakes were that we didn’t take some time to get off the treadmill,” says Chris Robinson. “But it’s kind of like being a fighter, they want you to fight as much as you can when you’re in your prime because you get the biggest purse. I felt at the time that I was somewhat savvy enough to realise the nuances of that. It doesn’t matter how good the music is, or how deep or soulful your expression is, they just want you to make them some money.”  By the 21st Century it was all a mess. Scrapping like tomcats, the Black Crowes fell out over royalties, over the cost of tour buses, and about how best to deal with members misusing hard drugs. A reliable theatre draw – even at their most popular, the group declined to move into arenas – by now the Georgians were playing corporate events for a hundred grand a pop. Nice work if you can get it, I suppose, but a distant cry from the days of railing against a beer company sponsoring a tour on which they were merely special guests.   For his part Steve Gorman recalls that “there were fistfights on the [tour] bus. There were insults lobbed at wives. There were threats given and received with staggering regularity. It never ended, so it never began anew. It was constant. And every night, through all of that [there] were [other] things that happened that Chris and Rich couldn’t be bothered to notice.” To no one’s surprise, neither Robinson brother will admit to having read their drummer’s 346-page letter of revenge. “I get that the last bit of money he can get is to make me and Rich look bad,” says the singer, adding “I’m just not interested in his point of view.” On the line from Tennessee, the younger sibling says something that to me sounds valid. “Steve Gorman told me one time that the thing that scared everyone the most was when me and Chris got along,” he says. “And I thought, ‘What a really f***** up way to look at things. All of our greatest records and successes with the band happened when Chris and I were on the same page. And when that’s the case, whether or not that’s counter to people’s little power grabs, a rising tide floats all boats.” Which is why, even now, it is surely unwise to write off the Black Crowes. In recent publicity photographs, the Robinson brothers look like the kind of bearded and suited Southern gentlemen who have never once raised their voices in anger. The fact that their group has burned through fifteen members suggests otherwise. But with an American tour having fallen prey to the virus, instead the pair have written a batch of songs that Rich Robinson describes as “our best in decades”. If this is true, and should their authors be able to cleave together, for the first time in an age the results might just be remarkable.  “There’s nothing wrong with success and there’s nothing wrong with ambition,” Chris Robinson tells me. “I’m lucky to be in one of the last generations of people who caused trouble. It might look destructive in my career, but I didn’t care what the record company had to say. I still don’t care. Those guys don’t live like me, they don’t look like me, and they don’t smell like me. It’s part of that idea of the artist as the outsider. It’s about being able to find beauty and art in madness.  ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/black-crowes-interview-last-trouble-makers/
154,"Chaos Walking, review: women read men’s thoughts, annoying apocalypse ensues","It takes around three minutes for Chaos Walking to fully set out its premise, and around three seconds more for everyone watching to realise it’s not going to work. Doug Liman’s   unfolds on a faraway planet whose human colonisers have fallen prey to what must be the most embarrassing virus in the universe. This infection – which is both omnipresent and untreatable – renders every male of the species’ inner monologue both audible and visible: passing thoughts pop out in Tourette’s-like bursts, while the images in their minds’ eyes dance around their heads as holographic blobs.  This is exactly the kind of idea that might have mileage on the page – and in fact did, in the acclaimed series of novels by Patrick Ness on which Chaos Walking was based. But on screen, it’s irritating beyond measure. Imagine trying to watch a film in which almost every character on screen is constantly muttering to themselves and usually has their face obscured by computer-generated purple wisps. Now imagine hearing a pitch for said film and deciding to spend £70 million on it. The second of those things actually happened at the studio Lionsgate ten years ago, but there’s still time to save yourself from the first. Tom Holland is the man whose job it is to ease the viewer into the cacophony. He plays Todd Hewitt, which is a name you won’t easily forget, since one of the mantras he keeps repeating in order to conceal his thoughts from others is “I am Todd Hewitt”. Todd’s home is Prentisstown, a grubby, future-Western frontier settlement presided over by Mads Mikkelsen’s fur-coat-enfolded mayor. The place is an entirely female-free zone, owing to a long-ago massacre of its womenfolk by the planet’s natives, a race of generic grey aliens called the Spackle. Or at least that’s the mayor’s story – though anyone who reflects for a split second on what life might be like if every woman could hear exactly what was going on inside the head of every nearby man might well surmise there may be an alternative explanation for their absence. As such, Todd’s first encounter with a person of the opposite sex is when one comes plummeting out of the sky. Her name is Viola (Daisy Ridley), and she is the sole survivor of another colonial mission, and has to be protected from Prentisstown’s inhabitants at all costs. A lengthy cross-country trek ensues – to give Chaos Walking its due, it more than delivers on the walking – during which Viola is regularly appalled by her companion’s (exceedingly tame) teenage fantasies, which he involuntarily broadcasts to everyone within earshot, when he isn’t chuntering on about something else. Drab of palette, po of face, and perfectly in step with the finger-waggy sexual politics of the age, Chaos Walking feels like a belated attempt by Lionsgate to fill the Hunger Games-shaped hole in its portfolio, with young leads drawn from the Marvel and Star Wars stables to give it a head start. (The film was mostly shot back in 2017, but   two years later: one of the perils of casting the stars of existing franchises is there doesn’t tend to be much give in their schedules.)   On camera, however, Holland and Ridley have all the rapport of two tree trunks, and the deeper dramatic and comedic possibilities of the one-way torrent of intimate thoughts between them goes bafflingly unexplored. Perhaps the overarching conceit of Chaos Walking might just be impossible to render convincingly in motion-picture form, but when the film ends up being psychologically outmanoeuvred by the old Mel Gibson comedy What Women Want into the bargain, it’s not good news.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/chaos-walking-review-women-read-mens-thoughts-annoying-apocalypse/
155,"The Gesualdo Six capture the solemnity and mystery of Easter, plus April’s best classical concerts","Lockdown may have crippled normal concert life, but the seasonal rhythms can still be discerned in the reduced output of streamed concerts. We’re now in Holy Week, and concerts celebrating the theme of Easter are briefly taking over the schedules. However Easter is a difficult theme on which to hang a concert, as the solemnity of the season enforces a dark and serious tone. Wednesday night’s concert from Gesualdo Six at Kings Place, London, didn’t try to sweeten the pill. All the music came from the Renaissance era, apart from two slender modern pieces, and the music was all built around themes of penitence and sorrow. Added to which the palette of sounds on the face of it seemed small; six male voices, reduced sometimes to a quartet or quintet. In fact, the variety of sound and feeling was astonishing, and coupled with the intimacy of just six voices it made for an enthralling hour. Sometimes the performances really made you sit up and take notice, like the three Tenebrae Responseries by that half-crazed melancholic of the late Renaissance, Count Carlo Gesualdo. “My soul is sorrowful even unto death,” says the text, and the singers found a startlingly harsh even ugly sound. Then, in typical Gesualdo fashion, the music suddenly burst into animated motion on the word “fugiam” (flee), slowing and descending by degrees to sepulchral stillness, an effect beautifully caught by the performers. There was drama elsewhere too. Judith Bingham’s Watch With Me combined the biblical narrative of the night in Gethsemane with lines culled from Wilfrid Owen about distant cannon-fire. Bingham set these lines to uncanny hummed harmonies while the singers passed the narrative from voice to voice, occasionally breaking the calmness with bursts of suppressed anxiety.  At the opposite pole was the innocent lightness of Joanna Ward’s Christus Factus Est. The effect of a single, dancing line shadowing itself before being abruptly pushed aside by other ideas created a vivid feeling of innocence and mystery. It was engaging on a musical level but hard to relate to the solemn message of the words: “Christ became for us obedient unto death.” These were the easier things to seize an audience’s attention with. Harder were the bigger pieces by three great Renaissance composers. Here drama was confined to understated touches like a descent to dark sounds for “night”, and expressivity was focused more on the intricate weave of voices and many small but telling fluctuations in tempo.  With only solo voices in play it’s easy for that weave to be disturbed and ruffled as the musical interest passes from singer to singer, but this group achieved a lovely balance between the interesting individual parts and the sonorous magic of the whole.  William Byrd’s Miserere Mei Deus and Tomás Luis de Victoria’s Tenebrae Responseries were wonderful, but the divine simplicity of Thomas Tallis’s Lamentations was even more telling. The way the singers gradually withdrew to stillness and quietness as the music found its way to the close was deeply moving.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/best-opera-classical-music-concerts-april-2021/
156,Why Daft Punk put on the robot masks: ‘It would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features’,"In the final scene of Daft Punk’s 2006 arthouse movie Electroma, a robot refracts sunlight through a broken glass and sets itself ablaze. It walks burning into the night and the credits roll.  Daft Punk revisited Electroma this week as the French electro duo released a video announcing their split after 28 years. Two robots – representing band members Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo – wander in the desert. Eventually they pause. One manipulates a device in their companion’s back. A countdown begins to bleep. The robot steps away and self-destructs. Music swirls in. It’s Touch, a melancholic mid-tempo workout from their 2013 album Random Access Memories.  It would require a heart of metal not to experience a twinge watching Daft Punk bow out. Yet it feels telling that the sequence with which they chose to exit is from earlier in the film, before the second robot goes up on smoke. Apparently a robot setting itself on fire is not a metaphor with which Daft Punk wished to engage as they exited the stage. They could give up on being pop stars. But they could not entirely walk away from being artificial people. At the end of the farewell clip, after all, one robot endures.  Pop stars hiding their identity behind a persona is nothing new. David Bowie did it with . And by the early Eighties Kraftwerk – Daft Punk’s teutonic precursors – had carried their “Man Machine” concept to the logical next step by behaving in a robot-like fashion in public (and, so the rumours went, in private too). More recently, groups such as London music collective Sault have arrived cloaked in mystery. Who are they, really? Nobody knows.  Daft Punk, though, took the conceit to extremes in that they appeared as invested in concealing their identity as they did in the idea of pop stars conjuring with alternative personas. Having first donned robot masks in the run-up to the 2001 album, Discovery, they seemed not so much fascinated with the idea of playing robot as in keeping their real appearances under wraps. This in part felt like a misjudgement regarding their degree of fame. Yes, hits such as Da Funk and Around The World had catapulted Daft Punk into the charts. But this was Chemical Brothers/Crystal Method level of celebrity – not Britney Spears besieged at the hair dressers. Even if the whole world knew what they looked like it’s quite possible they could have stomped around Paris or their adopted home of Los Angeles uninterrupted. On the scale of famous people you are likely to bump into in Hollywood, a French house duo was way down there.  Still, it hadn’t taken Bangalter and de Homem-Christo long to work out they weren’t keen on having their images plastered everywhere. When their 1997 debut, Homework, became a smash they took evasive action. They would wear bin-bags over their heads and plastic masks that blurred their features. Or else turn their backs on interviewers. Posing for the front of Mixmag that year they sported devil masks.  Nobody cared enough to be caught up in the drama of what they did or didn’t really look like. In part because their music was so sublime it eclipsed the two very humdrum men behind it. But also because of dance music’s culture of anonymity. The duos making up Orbital, Chemical Brothers and Leftfield all looked interchangeably like your older brother or possibly your dad. Few fans were especially invested in these musicians as celebrities in the first place. The whole point of techno is that it was extraordinary music created by ordinary people.  Daft Punk’s robot masks came later, debuting in a 2001 Face magazine photoshoot in Los Angeles. Initially the new look was received as an ironic commentary – in one memorable shot the two robots larked with members of a nudist colony.  “They wanted to portray a day in the life of Daft Punk,"" Luis Sanchis, the photographer behind the shoot told Creativeboom recently. “I came up with some of the scenarios, like the one with the people naked. That shot was actually taken in the Los Angeles house they were staying in at the time. We hired people from a real nudist colony, and as I was preparing the lights they came in – and all of a sudden, they were naked!” The masks were more than props. Working with Hollywood special effects designers and inspired by the robot Gort from The Day The Earth Stood Still, Daft Punk spent a fortune on the helmets and appeared to have poured as much creative energy into them as into their music. Collaborators were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. This was to prevent fans getting their hands on the mask blueprints. When copycats helmets started to circulate, Daft Punk were pleased to discover the measurements were slightly off – “the proportions are really hard to get right just by looking at pictures,” said Bangalter. Initially the helmets had featured “brown wigs”. At the last minute, on the way to that fateful nudist colony shoot, the duo had yanked out the hair extensions. Later versions would come with air-conditioning and sophisticated communications systems. Another set was designed specifically for media appearances: they were shinier and photographed better.  Yet in 2001 the masks were regarded as merely one component of Daft Punk’s playful new image. Indeed, the real focus was on their shapeshifting sound, which had progressed from floor-filling electronica to a sort of fantasy r’n b – influenced by house music but equally by movie scores and the Gallic-Japanese aesthetic of cartoons such as Ulysses 31, with its incredible theme by Denny Crockett and Ike Egan.  If Daft Punk were obsessed with the idea of themselves as robots, the public would be reeled in only when the duo embarked their first major world tour in 2006. Here, their anonymity was part of the fun as they bopped in their gleaming chrome robo-domes from inside an LED pyramid.  One rumour at the time was that Daft Punk had stayed at home and dispatched lackeys to do the gigs. This was a delicious conceit – and one better than Kraftwerk, who had publicly speculated that a day might come when they could put up their feet and send robots out to tour for them. Suddenly the robots made sense. Techno artists have been consistently underwhelming to watch live. In the nineties, seeing Paul Oakenfold or Carl Cox noodling on stage in their baggy t-shirts always broke the spell slightly. But electronic music played by a duo of shiny-headed robots – that was a spectacle that could sweep you away.  “We’re not performers, we’re not models – it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features,” de Homem-Christo told Rolling Stone in 2013, “but the robots are exciting to people.” This was one of several interviews they gave promoting Random Access Memories. That record was a conscious move away from electronica towards a warmer retro-pop. And yet most of the media coverage around the LP focused on their appearance – specifically, how ordinary they looked.  “De Homem-Christo, 39, has a wide face, delicate features, stubbled cheeks and long brown hair,” said Rolling Stone, as if describing a rare geological phenomenon rather than an electronic musician in early middle age. “Bangalter, 38, is tall, slightly rumpled, bearded, hair thinning, handsome in a cinema-studies-professor kind of way—he’s funny, good with eye contact, palpably eager to make himself understood,” added a GQ profile around the same time.  Stubbled cheeks, thinning hair – it was all so unremarkable. Indeed, had the pair not invested so thoroughly in the mystery of their appearance it’s a certainty that nobody would have cared. When last did anyone wonder what the members of The Chainsmokers looks like?  Still, with Daft Punk creating such a fuss about their “secret” identities it was inevitable someone would take a peek at their inner circuitry. And so images began to circulate of the pals in their off-duty duds. “Has Daft Punk been unmasked?” went a Vanity Fair story in 2014 – the same year they accepted their Album of the Year Grammy in white-tuxedo robot suits.  “Back in June, electronic duo the Knocks posted a photo on their Facebook page that appeared to show the French Daft Punk-ers—Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter—unmasked and playing champagne beer pong in the Sony offices, to boot,” continued the piece. “The picture was promptly removed from Facebook, the Knocks were banished from the music world entirely… and the Internet suddenly had what seemed to be a pretty good idea of what these dudes looked like.” This was by way of unveiling a new snap purporting to be of the pair at LAX. airport in Los Angeles. “One appears to be wearing a blue Texas Rangers hat,” said Vanity Fair. “The other may be wearing a trucker hat.”  These and other photos doing the rounds did not quite rock the world of pop. It turned out Daft Punk – two middle-aged French musicians – looked exactly as expected. Like two middle-aged French musicians.  Today, as fans process the duo’s break-up, they will experience a deluge of conflicting emotions. Gratitude for the wonderful music, regret Daft Punk did not have at least one more classic recording in them. But one thing nobody cares about is what these partners in escapist electronica look like in real life. If anything this overplayed mystery served as an unhelpful reminder that Daft Punk were as invested in marketing and hype as any other pop stars – that they were human after all. ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/would-not-enjoyable-humanity-see-features-daft-punk-put-robot/
157,"At the Barn in Cirencester, Morpurgo goes back to war, plus the best of April’s live theatre","Such will be the stampede to socialise as we emerge from lockdown – with hospitality venues and shops becoming the muster-stations of the stir-crazy – that what nascent interest there’s been in streamed theatre may be squashed underfoot. Until English theatres can re-open on May 17, however, the Barn Theatre in Cirencester is displaying the fighting spirit that has made it a force to be reckoned with, by serving up a double helping of Michael Morpurgo tales to the more acutely show-starved, as well as those seeking family fare at Easter. From April 19, it will stream the much-admired staging of Private Peaceful that was to have transferred to the West End last November. But first up from the Barn’s favourite author is An Elephant in the Garden (2010), which (like the other) is an adaptation by Simon Reade. Morpurgo, preoccupied with the need to impart, as from one generation to the next, the traumas of the 20th century, wings us from pre-war Dresden to its 1945 decimation by Allied bombs. As with War Horse, his best-known novel (and adapted play), an animal hero accentuates the pathos of the situation: it’s the reassuring embodiment of the innocence the world has lost, put in harm’s way yet mysteriously indestructible. There is, however, a twofold disappointment here. Firstly, Morpurgo never imbues the creature, christened Marlene (after Dietrich), with the same lovability and attention-demanding centrality that Joey in War Horse has. She is given nocturnal protection at home by a kindly zoo-keeper, whose daughter Lizzie is our watchful narrator, and thereby escapes the inferno. But thereafter she’s a sideshow. While a German-accented, dungaree-wearing Alison Reid, playing 28 roles in 60 minutes, is very good at giving subtle shape to the beast with bowed body, lumbering gait, and swaying trunk of arms, we’re a long way from the magic of Handspring’s puppetry at the National Theatre. The set-design by Max Johns, at least, does what little it can to insinuate an elephant in the room, via the suggestive shapes of a ruined grey wall. Morpurgo became a novelist through telling tales to school-children, and something of the schoolmaster resides in his work. There’s the educative imparting of key information, the ennobling insistence on recognising ourselves in “the enemy”. Yet there’s no doubt he knows how to hook you in, fracturing the cocoon of childhood with harsh real-world incidents while offering a compensatory strangeness and excitement. You might accuse him of converting historical suffering into the stuff of ripping yarns, and much in An Elephant in the Garden stretches credulity: narrow-escapes, young love across the enemy divide, even an encounter with a countess whose husband tried to assassinate Hitler. But the Second World War did throw up endless surprises, the terror of the bombings is succinctly relayed via blast-effects and cowering postures, and the piece has one foot in the truth: while animals died at Dresden Zoo, there was an adopted baby elephant at Belfast Zoo, smuggled home in 1941 during the Blitz. Truth can be as strange as fiction. Reid has toured this work to several venues in the past, and it shows in her fleet shape-shifting and command of the material. The only thing missing, of course, is an audience to play to: her frantic make-believe is a lonely sight. Not much longer now.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/best-theatre-comedy-april-2021-review-live-stage-west-end/
158,"When cinemas, theatres and art galleries will reopen after lockdown","measures have begun to be gradually lifted, as some degree of normality returns over the spring and summer. There will be four phases to the easing of restrictions, but where do the arts fit in? Indoor performances will resume on or around May 17, as part of Step Three of the Government’s plan, with capacity  limited to up to 1,000 people. Normal outdoor performances of up to 4,000 attendees, as well as seated outdoor performances for up to 10,000 attendees, can also resume. Larger indoor performances will be back no earlier than June 21, as part of Step Four. The Prime Minister also suggested that rapid testing might be introduced as part of the return of larger performances. Hairspray at the Coliseum is  scheduled to open to the general public in June, while Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella and The Prince of Egypt will open in July. Some other big West End shows have postponed their planning openings for this year, including Sister Act, Frozen, and Get Up, Stand Up: The Bob Marley Musical.  Social distancing will remain in place until at least June 21. It has a decisive effect on whether shows are financially viable or not, since it reduces the audience capacity dramatically, in some cases to one-third or less. Most shows need around 70 to 80 per cent of seats filled merely to break even. As a result, if social distancing continues into mid-summer or later, many venues might delay re-opening, as they work out whether they can actually afford to keep putting on shows with reduced audiences, or whether it’s best to wait and save their resources for now. Inside the auditorium, audiences should expect most Covid precautions to remain in place – such as compulsory mask-wearing during performances, the use of e-tickets and card payments rather than cash, one-way systems and frequent use of hand sanitiser. It is not yet clear whether venues will require any proof of vaccine, or will continue to do temperature checks at the door as they did in 2020. Drive-in cinemas can reopen from April 12, while indoor cinemas will return on May 17 or soon after. The range of films on offer will most likely feel bare compared to pre-Covid times but song-delayed blockbusters including  , starring Tom Cruise, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In The Heights, and Marvel's Black Widow, which have all moved to mid-summer releases, will capitalise on the timing. The much delayed Bond film,  , however, is unlikely to brought forward from its current November date. The experience for cinemagoers will likely be similar to 2020. Most chains were maintaining social-distancing measures across all areas within the cinema, and offering hand sanitiser to all ticket holders and employees, while toilets were stocked with anti-bacterial hand soap and staff had been given stringent hand-washing guidelines. Since last year, booking systems have been updated to allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households in the auditoria. Start and end times for films were being staggered to regulate crowding, and one-way systems operated throughout the buildings. Face coverings were mandatory. Museums will be able to re-open from May 17; while art galleries were not specifically mentioned in the announcement, it is assumed that they will also re-open then. Jean Dubuffet: Brutal Beauty at the Barbican will open on May 17; Matthew Barney: Redoubt and Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust at the Hayward Gallery will open on May 19. Major spring and summer exhibitions, like the V&A’s Alice, Whitechapel Gallery’s Eileen Agar and Tate Modern’s Rodin, are expected to open from the earliest possible dates. Mask wearing, limited advanced booking and social distancing measures will remain in place until at least June 21. Indoor concerts of up to 1,000 attendees, outdoor performances of up to 4,000, and seated outdoor performances of up to 10,000 can resume from May 17, while larger indoor and non-seated outdoor performances could be back from June 21. Pilot events to gauge the feasibility of that timescale will be running from April. This looks like excellent news for summer music festivals. While Glastonbury had to cancel its 2021 plans, many other major events, including Reading and Leeds, The Isle of Wight, and Wireless, have  Thanks to bubble systems and regular testing, many shows resumed production in 2020 and have continued into the new year. Last May, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and other British broadcasters agreed a set of guidelines for the safe operation of sets, and these are expected to remain in place for the time being.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/when-theatres-reopen-cinemas-art-galleries-2021-rules-covid-lockdown/
159,,"It was inevitable, I suppose. Game of Thrones, the HBO fantasy phenomenon that became  , is to turn into a stage show destined for both Broadway and our own West End. Theatre snobs may roll their eyes and whinge about a lack of imagination in commissioning; many will say it’s a cynical money-making exercise and a sign of cultural moribundity. But that would be short-sighted. The combination of two talented individuals, director Dominic Cooke (in my view, one of the greatest artistic directors of the past few decades) and writer Duncan MacMillan (whose 2015 play People, Places and Things made me literally gasp for breath) suggests that this extravaganza will be, to paraphrase actor Ian McShane – who appeared in Game of Thrones on TV – more than just “t---s and dragons”. It is my hope that, once we have come out of a lockdown that has devastated the sector, a new direction for theatre will emerge which is both sensible and free of the political agendas that have dominated the sector in recent years. Ultimately, the industry needs to realise that shows such as Game of Thrones are going to be instrumental in alleviating their considerable financial woes and inspiring a public who desperately need cheering up. There is also a by-product to all this. As we have seen with the phenomenal success of  , theatre can be highly effective in connecting us, in a visceral way, to something read on the page or seen on screen. The cinematic world inspired by JK Rowling is a mere shadow of what Jack Thorne, John Tiffany and Sonia Friedman’s production achieved at the Palace Theatre: emotionally engaged and (yes) much more magical. And, aside from Game of Thrones, there are other big ventures afoot. There’s the new Doctor Who immersive theatrical experience, Time Fracture, and postponed productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella and Frozen (the latter based on the successful Disney franchise). The return of theatre as spectacle suddenly looks tangible and thrilling. I am not trying to be a Pangloss or Pollyanna. I realise that theatre must challenge us, and provoke big questions about the world we live in, but at the moment it has such obstacles to overcome – principally, the salvage of the livelihoods of those working in the industry – that, when it returns, its mission to entertain must be paramount. The sector needs to be free, too, from the constraints of woke agitation – for examples,   – which have proved so corrosive, so resistant to artistic freedom on the stage. Although the phrase “learning from history” is unconvincing – can we ever really “learn” from history? – I think we could do worse than look at our 18th-century ancestors, whose reputation for unbridled (and licentious) entertainment gave a fillip to the industry. Despite a new stability, brought about by Britain’s aloofness from the conflicts raging through Europe, life for the majority of people in Georgian Britain was tough. Precipitated by the Industrial Revolution, there were dire conditions, overcrowding in our cities and little in the way of human rights. Nevertheless, with booming literacy came a growing appetite for culture in all its forms – and in particular, light relief. These conditions made the 18th century the golden age of theatre. Vast auditoria were built in order to accommodate punters from different social backgrounds who enjoyed different sorts of entertainment. There was a growing interest in Shakespeare, albeit in radically altered productions (spoiler alert: neither King Lear nor Cordelia died in the productions of the 1700s). There were, meanwhile, new hits such as John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, and high demand for acrobats, tightrope walkers and the like. Most importantly, this was the age that gave lifeblood to London’s West End. Despite the constraints imposed by the Licensing Act of 1737, which gave the Lord Chamberlain the final say on what did and what didn’t get produced – and remained in place until 1968 – theatre was given a new vigour by actor-managers such as David Garrick, who embodied a new populism and ushered in a radical acting style that was more realistic and less mannered. Far be it from me to suggest that we should reintroduce cock-fighting or badger-baiting into the ecology of post-pandemic live events. But there was a pragmatism in the spirit of the British under the Hanoverians, and we in 2021 could all be inspired by it. Despite the gloom that has descended on the industry I love, I feel optimistic for the future of theatre. It will emerge from the fog of the past year leaner, but (I hope) with a renewed sense of purpose, and a clear vision of what is important. Westeros may seem like a world away from what, to many people, the West End should be about, but popular spectacles such as this should not be faulted. They are going to play a crucial part in London’s recovery – and that of the world of theatre beyond it.    ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/theatre-snobs-get-behind-game-thrones-might-actually-enjoy/
160,What’s next for opera and classical music: digital concerts and intergenerational war,"Classical music and opera in Britain have faced crises before – two world wars, plagues, government bans during the Cromwellian period – but never anything as bad as  . And yet, long before the pandemic struck, these ancient and inherently traditional artforms were already in difficulties. Both suffer from aging and shrinking audiences, and a cultural and political climate increasingly hostile to “elitism”. In response, they’ve been taking steps to renovate themselves. “Diversity” and “accessibility” are now the keywords, aims which are sometimes hard to square with other values – the need to preserve a core repertoire of masterpieces, for example, or to produce radical and “challenging” art. The early signs are that the pandemic has accelerated existing trends, perhaps beyond the point of no return. With venues closed, and income streams from live audiences cut off, institutions have been forced to be innovative. Many have embraced the challenge of   live and pre-recorded concerts, though the economics of this are dubious; with ticket prices pitched between £7 and £12, the income stream is modest compared to ticketed live concerts. Nonetheless, digital performances are here to stay. Dougie Scarfe, chief executive of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, says the vital thing has been to stay visible. “We wanted to say to our audience: ‘We are here for you.’ And we wanted to get back to employing musicians as well. So we built our stage to allow 50 musicians to play with social distancing, and we put on a complete season of digital concerts. I think the pandemic has accelerated our move into the digital sphere by about five years.” Jenny Jamison, chief executive of the Scottish Ensemble, had to cope with even stricter lockdown conditions than those imposed in England. “We could only do outdoor concerts, and even those were cancelled. This encouraged us to move into digital presentation, which we’d been thinking about for a while but never had a quiet moment to work on. We worked with two production companies, because I believe it has to be a different sort of experience than just reproducing a concert. We also had to move all our education work online, and by doing that we reached 150 schools, which is many more than we could ever reach in person.” Still, when you ask whether their changes will be permanent, the “yes” is always followed by a “but”. The insistence on the importance of the live event is a mantra one hears again and again. “I love the spontaneity that comes from working on really short time-frames, which the pandemic necessitated,” Jamison says, “and it would be a mistake to lose the new skills we’ve acquired. But nothing can replace the live event.” But what will those live events involve? Will institutions need to be more cautious in their programming, to win back their traditional audiences? Jamison says no, but in Bournemouth, Scarfe is more circumspect. He’s keenly aware that other values are at play. “I’ve had letters from audience members saying that just seeing the BSO on stage on their screens every Wednesday gives them a comforting feeling of normality. But of course the social dimension is missing. I really want to get out on tour again, because our concerts are a social experience as much as a musical one.” When I ask whether the orchestra will have to be more local in its choice of invited artists, as a consequence of both the pandemic and Brexit, the answer is “no, but”. “We are an international business,” he says, “and we want to draw on the widest pool of talent. But it’s true there is an administrative burden of extra red tape, and extra costs for touring projects.” In the  , one finds the same tension between wanting to capitalise on the new ideas thrown up by the pandemic, while hanging onto a core artistic mission. Some companies have been really bold, none more so than English Touring Opera. It has made a filmed version of the St John Passion involving amateur choirs from all over the UK, and a series of filmed small-scale performances called Lyric Solitudes, which are bold dramatisations of song cycles. James Conway, ETO’s director, is enthused by the idea that opera will become more local in terms of both performing talent and artistic identity. “I really dislike these touring international co-productions, where the same production turns up in six different cities. For me, it’s the operatic equivalent of the airport duty-free shop’s luxury brands.” Will the digital aspect of ETO’s work continue? “Absolutely, but as a supplement, rather than displacing live performance. For me, that offers something irreplaceable.” The company has taken a big financial hit, but when I ask whether recovering from that will necessitate a more cautious programming policy in the future, he’s adamant. “No way. It’s an illusion that that’s a safe way forward, because there is no safe. If we just present La Traviata and Madama Butterfly all the time, it’s nothing more than a temporary fix. In the end it will be the death of the art form.” That’s the view of a small, nimble-on-its-feet touring opera company. You’d expect a flagship company like the Royal Opera, however, to be more cautious about artistic policy in the future, given the sheer size of the organisation, and the cultural role it’s expected to fulfil. When I ask chief executive Alex Beard whether the new mantra of “make it local” could apply at Covent Garden, he’s as circumspect as Dougie Scarfe in Bournemouth. “Up to a point, but I think here there will be always an expectation to see the very greatest artists in the flesh.” Meaning: we’re still willing to pay top dollar for Jonas Kaufmann and Anna Netrebko. With only 20 per cent of the company’s income coming from subsidy it’s taken a terrible financial hit, and has had to resort to redundancies and selling off assets including a David Hockney painting. Are there any silver linings? “My feeling is this pandemic has brought the arts community together in a way that’s never happened before. For example, every Friday morning there’s a Zoom meeting where dozens of people who run arts organisations meet up to share ideas. That would never have happened before the pandemic.” What is difficult to predict is how the deeper currents of values and meanings expressed in these traditional artforms will change. Will there be a huge upsurge in love for the core classics, as audiences crave comfort and security? Or will the move to new technologies breed radically new forms? In my opinion, and to judge by what I hear, it will be both at once: the fragmentation that’s already visible is going to accelerate in the coming years. A once-unified field could end up divided along different demographic divides: over here, “chill-out” or “healing” classics for younger audiences, in clubs or community centres; over there, defiantly traditional concerts and operas for older ones, in traditional venues. These divisions are more than demographic: they’re rooted in very different conceptions of what the words “classical” and “opera” actually mean. The struggle over who “owns” these artforms may become the defining feature of the post-pandemic age.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/next-opera-classical-music-digital-concerts-intergenerational/
161,"What’s next for dance: post-Brexit bullishness, but fears of a lost British generation","As with so many artforms, the dance industry has seen a  , as live shows attended by audiences have given way to work on screens, watched at home. “They’ve become an integral part of our programming, rather than an add-on,” says David Nixon, artistic director of Northern Ballet. That change might have happened over the next few years, but Covid “has catapulted it ahead”. Online, the offering has largely ranged from archive productions to  . The last of these, to my mind, have proved the most effective as a viewing experience, since they’re specifically designed for that medium – and our couch-bound attention span. “I’m not sure people want to sit in front of full-length ballets at home,” Nixon agrees. “The energy and focus in the theatre keeps people engaged.” Post-pandemic, I’d hope to see more practitioners making a virtue of the digital turn, as that’s what the best ones have done this past year: we’ve had the wit of Corey Baker’s Swan Lake Bath Ballet, the ingenuity of Sophie Laplane’s Indoors, the hard-hitting provocation of Jonzi D’s Our Bodies Back. They reached viewers nationwide and around the world; they connected with those who wouldn’t think of going to dance houses, or couldn’t afford to. It’s a way for dance to sell itself to new audiences – not always its strongest suit. “People often say ‘I don’t like ballet’,” Nixon says, “but they’ve never actually seen it. They just think of tutus and men in tights. Part of our job is to get a broader audience to understand that the menu has changed. Some of our online pieces are almost short films first, dance second.” This might be a way to close the gap between TikTok crazes and Swan Lake. “Perhaps there’s an audience that isn’t interested in sitting in a theatre, but will watch our work on an iPad.” The problem, as ever, will be financial. As an alternative business model, digital “is not yet realistic,” says Tamara Rojo, English National Ballet’s artistic director and lead principal. “We’re a company of 70 dancers and 60 musicians. We need to perform in theatres.” Unfortunately, that’s still a way off: the Government’s roadmap has venues reopening no earlier than May 17, and with full audiences – theoretically – in June. And companies such as ENB also need to know whether they can tour productions any time soon. That’s a major way of democratising dance: companies bring it to your local theatre, and at a reasonable price. National tours involve moving easily around the UK. “Will we be allowed to do that?” Rojo worries. “Dance is a people-heavy art form: a big classical ballet means a full company, musicians, backstage workers. We’re paying for travel and hotels. It’s expensive.” Beyond our borders, too, there are worries about travel arrangements. Normally, ENB’s national tours make a loss, but they’re subsided by their international ones. The latter are more profitable, Rojo explains, because “those producers have bigger budgets, and we can form commercial partnerships, or perform at high-paying festivals.” Might this mean raising UK ticket prices, at least while social distancing is still in place? It’s an adamant no. “We supply thousands of tickets for as little as £12. That’s part of our mission.” And when audiences come back, what will they see on stage? Dance isn’t usually the most reactive artform, since productions have such long lead-times. Recently, though, the best works have shown new boldness and urgency. Last October, for example, I was moved by Will Tuckett’s Lazuli Sky for Birmingham Royal Ballet, a one-act piece that drew on our rediscovery of nature during lockdown. Nixon doesn’t feel as though he needs to put Covid on stage just yet: “Maybe in a year or two, when we come back to reflect on it.” But Rojo thinks some work is ripe for fresh resonance: her forthcoming Florence Nightingale-inspired reworking of Petipa’s Raymonda will honour the nursing profession. Rojo herself is an optimist: she reckons we’re going to see “an artistic renaissance” post-pandemic. Sadly, it won’t involve everyone. Some have already left the industry, hit by the triple whammy of no work prospects, no financial support and the loss of intensive physical training. Dancers, at this level, are akin to Olympic athletes: dormancy is lethal. It’s also tough on students and emerging artists, cast into a punishing job market with few professional opportunities. How many can stick it out? Are we in danger of losing our next generation of talent? And given closed borders and post-Brexit visas, one might worry that Rojo’s “renaissance” will be too UK-focused. Dance is such a collaborative form, led by international choreographers. Nixon is cautious: “We have fantastic British dancers in the company, but lots from other countries too. You don’t grow in isolation – you need to be fed by what’s out there.” But if anything, he believes, Brexit “will push us even more to collaborate and reach across borders”. After all, dance is a universal language. Rojo agrees: “Anybody can look at it and feel something.” In her view, we should take pride in the fact that British companies are in such demand all over the world – something that isn’t going to change. One positive consequence of the pandemic has been a lasting change at the political level: this artform – so often overlooked – is now firmly on the agenda. Rojo thinks of her position at ENB as “an honour and a great responsibility. Speaking out for the arts, lobbying the Government – it’s given me more conviction.” She now advocates the introduction of a living wage and better job security. With dance taking its rightful place centre-stage, the prospects really are exciting. “We’ve sustained everyone through lockdown,” says Rojo. “We drive the recovery of other sectors, and we help give the UK its identity. “We know how many doors the arts can open. That’s going to be more important than ever.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/dance/ballet/next-dance-post-brexit-bullishness-fears-lost-british-generation/
162,,"To a large section of the population this week,  , will be no different from any other week of the year; perhaps remarkable this year only inasmuch as it marks the beginning of the slow easing of our escape from  .  It is different for the country’s dwindling band of observant Christians for whom this week, leading up to Easter Sunday, is a solemn time of remembrance when we try to penetrate the mystery of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection and remind ourselves of why this event, some two millennia ago, still matters. The rest of the country looks on with a largely benign indifference, accepting Easter, like Christmas, merely as a public holiday stripped of its religious significance. This will be a matter of regret for many sincere Christians who may be asking themselves why it is that this society, which only a few decades ago was so much more explicitly religious, has altered so swiftly? Why it is that religious practice is such a minority pursuit and why an understanding of the fundamentals of the Christian religion cannot now be taken for granted even among supposedly educated people?  And if they dig deep enough they should conclude that part of the answer to those questions lies with the way our broadcasters treat religion. We now live in an era in which the mass media, for better or worse, shapes our public morality. Observing this changed landscape, many social conservatives are apt to point the finger of blame at the Church of England itself; it is the C of E, they say, which by bending before the prevailing wind of permissive liberal attitudes has allowed the old Christian morality to be repudiated and replaced by a new ""media morality"".  This new morality, in essence, tells people that fusty old notions of ""sin"" can be dispensed with because they have no substance. Criticisms of the Anglican church do have some force (Private Eye’s parodic Rev. J.C. Flannel seems sometimes more documentary than imaginary) but are also unfair in my view. The Church faces, in the shape of our media, an opponent which vastly out-guns it in terms of reach and influence. Which is why the remarks by the Bishop of Ripon, the Rt, Rev Helen-Ann Hartley in the Radio Times are worthy of note.   Bishop Hartley   where safely ""siloed away"" as she puts it, the Corporation can fulfil its quota of ""religious broadcasting"" without troubling the general audience overmuch. And she asks a pertinent question:  “Where are the documentaries that challenge us to rethink the world we live in? Or the dramas that ask us to re-imagine our human relationships? Instead of congratulating itself on producing more content than ever, I wonder if it’s time for the BBC to ask just what is the point of religion on the telly, or the radio for that matter?”  Good question, Bishop. The truth is that the BBC shies away from any explanation of the ills that afflict contemporary society which might undermine belief in the tenets of a permissive, liberal, interpretation of ""progress"". The BBC seemingly does not wish to engage with ideas that implicitly cast doubt on the benefits of our modern morality. Nor does it wish to explore the debt that the liberalism it so enthusiastically embraces owes to Christianity; for, in truth, without Christianity there would be no liberalism. No one has more deeply studied this phenomenon and better understood it than the political philosopher Sir Larry Siedentop, whose book Inventing the Individual – the Origins of Western Liberalism is an indispensable guide to understanding how we came to be as we are. As he trenchantly states in that book : “….in its basic assumptions, liberal thought is the offspring of Christianity”. And this matters greatly because as the influence of Christianity wanes in Britain, and throughout the western world, the danger surely is that liberalism itself will be imperilled.  Siedentop’s crucial insight is that the Christian notion of the uniqueness of every human being made ""in the image and likeness of God"" and endowed with an immortal soul is a deeply subversive one. Subversive because anyone who understands this concept and acts in good conscience on it can never be a supporter of an unjust hierarchical society where some people are treated as  unworthy and lesser beings. If practised sincerely the ‘Golden Rule’  that one should ""treat one’s neighbour as oneself"" is a surefire insurance against cruelty and injustice.  Siedentop points out that in the ancient world of the Greeks and Romans, slaves were accepted as part of the natural order and were – in a chilling phrase – regarded as ""living tools"". As Christianity took root and spread it inevitably undermined the whole notion of slavery which is why (even though it took hundreds of years and was sometimes disgracefully re-introduced in the pursuit of profit), slavery was abolished in western Europe.  So what has this to do with religious broadcasting and the BBC? Only this: that in order to understand our society, so concerned as it is with ""rights"" we have to understand where the notion of ""human rights"" comes from. And properly understood that leads ineluctably back to basic Christian teaching. But this is an understanding constantly frustrated by the BBC’s secular instinct which is to ascribe all that is good in our society to the Enlightenment of the 18th century and the insights of the leading intellectual figures of that period.  I was forcibly struck by this when listening a few days ago to an interview on the Today programme with Professor Richard Dawkins. The grand old man of militant atheism recently turned 80 and has published a new book. The BBC, ever-eager to promote a man who it clearly feels has vanquished the primitive superstitions of the Christian religion, gave him the usual courtesy of promoting his tome at length and conducted another fawning interview (this time by Nick Robinson).  In it he was allowed to state, yet again, that science explains all and will lead us all to a better world. But he was spared any thoughtful or difficult questions. He might, for instance, have been asked something like ""Would the strictly rational principles of science lead to the abolition of slavery? And if so how and why?"" Because, as far as I can see, science offers no moral insights whatsoever. They come from a different part of the intellectual spectrum – a part that people like Dawkins dismiss as make-believe.  The BBC’s worldview consciously militates against incorporating in its output an understanding of religion and its importance in human affairs. This is, in my experience, primarily because the BBC is staffed by people contemptuous of, and often also ignorant of, Christian history and teachings. Most programme-makers in the BBC are highly educated folk who have come through the atheistic degree-factories of Oxbridge. Many of these pocket intellectuals seem to think that all human progress began when the beliefs that dominated the years they call the ""Dark Ages"" were discarded in favour of the rational ideas of people like Voltaire.  In fact – as Siedentop clearly demonstrates – the truth is the exact opposite of this. Throughout the post-Roman era into the middle ages and the early-modern period the intuitions of Christianity, nurtured by Christian institutions like the monasteries, made for a constant improvement in the human condition – at least in Western Europe. But our modern intellectual class (to whom BBC people largely belong) reject the Christian contribution to western civilisation - which is immeasurable. This has led to distorted news values; it is why, for instance, the BBC rightly reports extensively on the plight of the   but consistently underplays the persecution of Christians in Muslim countries like Pakistan. In its skewed view the BBC seems to think that highlighting and campaigning for better treatment for Christians would show some kind of favouritism whereas, by championing the cause of the Muslim Uighurs it demonstrates its ""impartiality"". It is a shockingly partisan stance which only demonstrates the Corporation’s inherent antagonism towards Christianity. Over the years there have been many complaints about the BBC’s perceived anti-Christian stance – something we might term its ""Christophobia"". Back in 2011 Cardinal Keith O’Brien, the RC leader of Scotland’s Catholics, commissioned research into BBC news coverage after which he levelled the charge that the BBC was institutionally biased against Christianity. Peter Sissons, for many years one of the BBC’s most recognisable newsreaders, wrote in his memoirs about the Corporation’s animus against Christianity; he said the BBC saw Christians as ""fair game"". And just a few years ago a BBC World Service journalist of 30 years’ standing, Catherine Utley, went public with criticisms of how the BBC covers stories involving Christians. So Bishop Helen-Ann’s strictures on the BBC’s religious programmes are in good company. But the BBC will likely take no notice of her whatsoever. She will be airily dismissed along with all the complaints of those listed above – and many others. Supremely confident of its own good intentions, and convinced of its own superior wisdom, the BBC is leading our society down the wrong path. And that, in this Holy Week, is my Thought for the Day.  ",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/04/01/bbc-should-use-holy-week-reflect-anti-christian-bias/
163,,"‘This green plot shall be our stage,” announces Peter Quince in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, foreshadowing the era of open-air theatre that may be about to open up before us as lockdown eases. Shakespeare knew all about disease outbreaks and their choking effect on theatres. It seems such a long time ago now, when the first lockdown began last year, that everyone talked about how Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a plague lockdown when theatres were closed. (History remains silent on the number of Jaffa Cakes he ate out of sheer despair in that time.) More than 400 years on, theatres have been struggling with plague closures again, as   (Tuesday, World Service) explored. Karl Bos presented and produced this loving and contemplative behind-the-scenes look at how the   has navigated the pandemic, with contributions from RSC actors David Tennant and Noma Dumezweni, as well as Artistic Director   and Deputy Artistic Director Erica Whyman. Bos’s interviews took place at various points over the last year, and most heartbreaking was the sense of confidence, in the early conversations, that the pandemic was a storm that the theatrical behemoth that is the RSC, among the most firmly established and financially robust of all British theatre companies, was prepared to weather.  The RSC had kept paying its actors for as long as possible, while planning new projects using every technology they could think of. Initially they were bullish about their ability to ride it out. But a company that size costs a lot of money to run, and without any income from ticket sales, the coffers wouldn’t hold out for long. Panic soon crept in. In Shakespeare’s day, theatres were closed due to plague for long stretches of time. Obviously, it didn’t damage his legacy. His spirit lives on in the RSC management, but although the actors who contributed to the programme were passionate and determined, Bos’s conversations with Doran and Whyman sounded much less certain. There was fear in their voices for the fate of a beloved institution. We heard of the future, too, and the RSC’s plans for staging A Winter’s Tale for the screen, which will centre on a few key “electrifying” moments of physical touch, and of the company’s marking out of a new outdoor theatre space in which to stage fresh-air performances. The atmosphere was mournful for what we’ve lost, but still hopeful in the face of lockdown gloom. Bos asked Doran for a message from Shakespeare that might speak to how it will feel when we’re finally allowed to gather together again, waiting for a play to begin. Doran chose lines from Sonnet 67: “How like a winter hath my absence been from thee.” When Radio 3 plays Nirvana, you know that either something is very wrong, or that something radical is about to go down. It was the latter in   (Sunday, Radio 3), which began with the unmistakable power chord riff of Smells Like Teen Spirit.  A long way from 19th-century French poetry? Not really: the point of the programme was to explore Charles Baudelaire’s “transgressive” and “dangerous” resonance today, as well as his history as an inspiration for tortured countercultural heroes from Mick Jagger to Kurt Cobain and beyond. John Cooper Clarke, the poet who calls himself a “Bargain Basement Baudelaire”, said that he sees his own countercultural habits and drug use as pretty lightweight compared to Baudelaire’s daily mercury injections. The title of the programme was annoyingly po-faced and, thankfully, didn’t really represent the content at all. Presenter Michèle Roberts and producer Sara Jane Hall, did, however, elegantly draw a picture of the history of the bohemian flâneur and society’s double standard when it came to the treatment of women in 19th-century Paris, particularly when in relation to living a life of art, drugs and sex.  In the modern era of #MeToo (and its more in-your-face French equivalent, #balancetonporc, or “expose your pig”), what’s it like to read Baudelaire’s sexually exoticised, sometimes dissociated poems about women? Compelling, disturbing and vital, it turns out.  This programme was by no means the invitation to cancel Baudelaire that its title suggested; instead it presented Baudelaire’s work as eternal literature to surprise and unsettle us, and a mirror to confront our own most taboo darknesses, as real now as they were 200 years ago. The conclusion was hard to argue with: “Everybody should read Baudelaire, damn it.”",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/what-to-listen-to/alas-poor-rsc-will-left-pandemic-done/
164,"Demi Lovato’s shocking struggles become a witty, redemptive pop classic","’s career could serve as a cautionary tale for the dangers of modern fame, from cute   to multimillion selling pop superstar whose wholesome public image cracked to reveal a chaotic hidden life of sexual abuse, eating disorders and drug and alcohol addiction. Lovato was first admitted to rehab in 2011, at the age of 18, and has spent ten years between relapse and recovery, climaxing with a near fatal overdose in 2018. The triumph of her frankly fantastic seventh album is to take control of her own dramatic narrative and turn it into bright, witty, powerful and joyfully redemptive pop. Dancing with the Devil… The Art of Starting Over may be the perfect pop artefact for our age of Instagrammatic oversharing, in which divisions between private and public life are increasingly blurred. It is accompanied by a YouTube documentary series in which Lovato tells her access-all-areas story with a frankness that would have horrified Hollywood publicists in more prudish times. She has revealed that her first sexual experience was rape, at the age of 15, while filming a Disney movie, and has now come out as proudly bisexual. Her experiences clearly echo those of many young women in the media spotlight, and have an electrifying currency in our #MeToo moment, lending Lovato a gravitas not usually associated with her brand of shinily commercial pop. In many ways – and without a hint of cynicism – her timing could not have been better, with the potential to transform her huge American popularity into a major global superstar brand. And Lovato seems determined to make the most of it. The opening three tracks are heavyweight ballads on which she really lays herself on the line. Anyone is performed to solo piano backing, and features a raw vocal unadorned by harmonies or studio effects. Lovato can sing in the melismatic style of   and  , and it’s impressive to hear that voice so naked, on a song so brutally unsparing of her own insecurities, in which she admits to only confiding her darkest secrets to alcohol, while roaring “I feel stupid when I sing / Nobody’s listening to me.” An album’s worth of such stripped-back intensity might have been impressive, if hard on the nerves, but following the lushly cinematic Dancing With the Devil and delicate ICU (a title with the double meaning of feeling seen and waking in an Intensive Care Unit), Lovato shifts the perspective to post-recovery, with a breezily engaging second title-track, The Art of Starting Over. “I let the darkness out”, the backing vocals chirp while Lovato flutters overhead. The rest of the album maintains this upbeat spirit, with Lovato’s fantastic voice tripping through nimble rhythms and spacious, uncrowded arrangements, featuring acoustic guitar and soft synths providing snappy hooks. Melon Cake may be the most cheerful song about anorexia you will ever hear, with Lovato protesting industry pressure to “make me Barbie-sized”, but the emphasis being on overcoming her demons. Lonely People is a joyful anthem about self-love, My Girlfriends are My Boyfriend offers a delightful paean to female friendship, and The Kind of Lover I Am is a catchy ode to monogamy on which Lovato trumpets confident pansexuality when she sings “Doesn’t matter if you’re a woman or a man” then ad libs “or you can be in-between.” Typical of the light touch exhibited throughout, Met Him Last Night offers a flirty duet with   in which the seductive title character is the Devil, which succeeds in both acknowledging the dangers of the high life and making fun of them at the same time. The great pleasure of Lovato’s album is that it succeeds in grappling with serious matters without jettisoning any of the lightness, melodiousness, nimble rhythms and sugar-high hooks of her pop genre. There are 18 songs, including a strong version of Tears For Fears’ 1982 alienation classic Mad World. The quality throughout is top-notch, despite having apparently been composed and recorded, for the most part, during lockdown conditions, with teams of professional writer-producers working in adjoining studios while Lovato flitted around, sprinkling vocal magic. Production line pop can be so determinedly effective that it risks becoming wearing and empty over an entire album. Yet with such strong narrative material, the balance between form and substance here ensures your interest never flags. Whatever Lovato has been through, she sounds like she is where she wants to be now. For an album drawing on despair and recovery, Dancing with the Devil… The Art of Starting Over is a life-affirming pleasure from top to bottom.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/demi-levatos-shocking-struggles-become-witty-redemptive-pop/

She grew up on a hardscrabble farm in Pennsylvania, in Amish country, the third of four children trained to work hard – her tasks included painting the barn, mowing the lawn and pouring concrete. Her parents were always too busy to pay much attention to her. There were dodgy relatives around, like Uncle Gene, who was good fun until she found him holding a gun to his head and threatening to kill himself for what seemed like hours. “This killing-oneself business is a very time-consuming situation,” she sighs, “and, I have found, somewhat boring.” But she also had her beautiful Aunt Vonne and even more beautiful grandmother Lela, who wore Schiaparelli suits and Guerlain perfume, and would take her to stay with them where she felt “I was someone’s favourite. I mattered somewhere.” Aunt Vonne taught her about books and paintings; grandmother Lela taught her to steal – “Oh I could put the entire dinner service in your bag while talking to you. Yes, I probably could pick a pocket with a bit of practice. Old light fingers.” Stone was obviously bright but a misfit at school. “I was in trouble all the time for doing that wholly unfeminine thing of THINKING.” Rather than go to university, she preferred waitressing at the local McDonald’s and winning county beauty pageants. Her elder brother Mike worked on an air force base unloading headless corpses from Vietnam – “The Viet Cong took heads, we took ears, in case you didn’t know about the trophy side of war.” But when he started dealing cocaine “it got really scary really fast”, and he was sent to prison for l0 years. Sharon’s mother, Dot, thought she should get away and decided she should be a model. She had seen an interview with Eileen Ford on television, so she took Sharon to New York and turned up at Eileen Ford’s agency. Mrs Ford signed Sharon on sight. She was too short and curvaceous for catwalk modelling but she still made $5,000 a day doing all the “difficult” jobs – bathing suits in winter and fur coats in summer – whizzing round New York on roller skates. Then she went to an extras’ casting call for a   and Allen spotted her in the queue, told her she was a natural, and gave her a part in Stardust Memories (1980). Other parts followed and she went to Cannes for Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. But she felt she was “ageing out of the business” by the time she made her l8th film, Basic Instinct, which made her a star. Critics panned the film and laughed when she was nominated for a Golden Globe, but audiences loved it. She made dozens of films, mainly forgotten, though she was Oscar-nominated for her part in Casino, directed by Martin Scorsese. As an actor she had a reputation for being difficult – she says it was often because she refused to sleep with the director or her co-star. “Sex, not just sexuality on-screen, has long been expected in my business.” But also she was proud to be “a studio girl” and would happily snitch on other actors or crew if she felt they were drugging or drinking and not doing their jobs. “I was on the side of the studio – not a popular position to be in… It would be fair to say I f----- myself.” By the late 1990s her career was already winding down and she moved from Los Angeles to Northern California. She was married and wanted to have children but after a series of miscarriages she adopted a baby, Roan. He was only l8 months old when she had her stroke. The surgery took seven hours and left her with a distorted face and a dragging leg. She lost short-term memory and couldn’t read for two years. “Yes, I lost many things: my career, my savings, my residential custody of my son, my so-called marriage, my place in line in regaining my career, my former ability to simply look at any page of dialogue for two minutes and have instant recall, and a kind of luminous beauty that I hadn’t even realised that I’d had.” She fought for custody of her son for l3 years, unsuccessfully, but she adopted two more sons, Laird and Quinn, as a single mother. Dior gave her a beauty contract that kept her going financially for several years, until she blew it by making disobliging remarks about China, which jeopardised Dior’s Chinese market. She says now, at 63, she is something of a recluse. She can walk normally and has regained “most” of her memory but the right side of her head still hurts. She takes acting roles when offered but is not hungry for it as she used to be. She spends most of her time doing charitable work, raising money for Aids or handing out sleeping bags to homeless people, or taking a friend to Native American full-moon hoop ceremonies to cure her cancer. Unfortunately this is much less fun to read about than her rumbustious childhood or her Hollywood career. But there are enough great yarns and sardonic jokes in the rest of the book to make up for the woo-woo “inspirational” babble at the end.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/sharon-stone-could-pick-pocket-bit-practice/
166,Will a trip to the theatre ever be the same again?,"Uncertainty was the watchword last year for British  . Flexibility – born of ongoing uncertainty – will be the modus operandi of regional theatres as they gear up for   in May, with the nominal prospect of ‘back to normal’ from midsummer. The variables this year are as much to do with what audiences will need in order to feel comfortable about returning to playhouses as they are to do with the vicissitudes of the virus. Stand by for the continuation of socially distanced audiences on certain days of the week even after the official lifting of restrictions. And the possibility, too, should   be made, or become, a staple means of unlocking society, that theatre doors will be alternately thrown open to those with and those without them. This week sees the announcement of the second tranche of grants from the  , aimed at tiding organisations over to June. The swelling torrent of announcements about impending work should grow to a flood after Easter.  James Brining, artistic director of the Leeds Playhouse, speaks for many in describing the coming month as critical in theatre’s resurrection: “For me, it’s all about how the next few weeks, and how those stages in the roadmap, work out: what will be the effect of April 12, and then May 17? It’s a make-or-break period.” Something major will surface soon in Leeds in the shape of the postponed production – co-presented with   – of  ’s A Little Night Music, which Brining reveals has been reconceived for social distancing. “When I listened to it again I started to reimagine it. The piece is about not wasting your life, seizing the moment, not being separated from the person you could be with. After the year we’ve lived through it should have huge weight.” The reopening programme of work will be announced soon. One certainty is that there won’t be shows running simultaneously in the two main auditoria; additionally, the new studio is being given over to different local artists to develop work for four months. There will be tighter timeframes in terms of looking (and booking) ahead: “We’ve broken the programme down – April to August, September to Christmas – so we can adjust things as we need to. If there’s no distancing at Christmas that’s a bonus. It’s not something we’re going to rely on.” The  ’s 50th anniversary season, beginning in September, will be announced towards the end of the month, but dance will animate the main-house stage from May 19 with a triple bill by Birmingham choreographer Rosie Kay, followed by a play about black working-class lives (Constructed), again in the main house. Sean Foley, its artistic director, is proceeding with caution. “I haven’t spoken to anyone who thinks theatres are going to fully reopen around June 21, but it’s clear that Boris really wants to stick to that timetable, so maybe it will be possible. What we’ve done is go: we can only produce shows that work financially at 50 per cent capacity.” Exactly the same rationale underpins the thinking of Iwan Lewis, at the  , which aims to hit the ground running after May 17 and keep going come what may, programming ambitious work – such as a new play about Russian online disinformation (A Russian Doll by Cat Goscovitch) – right until Christmas. “It’s all based on the assumption of 50 per cent houses and social distancing, and then everything else is a bonus. I just need to get 110 people in per performance.” Live-streaming, a forte here, will be continued as a valued add-on option and back-up plan. Just how complex the puzzle is for those who will be looking to do work at scale in the autumn is laid bare by Douglas Rintoul, artistic director of the Queen’s Hornchurch, Essex.  The main house will reopen in May with Tim Firth’s comedy about blokes on an outdoor bonding exercise,  . “We really wanted to do something set outside,” Rintoul jokes. “The last thing we wanted to do was a comedy set in a sitting room when we’ve all been sat indoors endlessly.” From June, they have two programming models, one corresponding to social distancing, one without. “The big problem is large-scale musicals, and the panto. Normally we’d start to build the panto set in May. We can’t take that risk. We’re looking to wait until September to start.” Assuming social distancing is lifted from mid-summer, is it conceivable there will be a “mixed economy” of audience capacities, in order to reassure returning patrons?   has announced that its production of South Pacific, running from July 5, will have a performance a week for socially distanced audiences.  At Nottingham, after its online Spring Loaded season – featuring in its Still Life series a new ‘vignette’ by  , offering a revealing personal glimpse into the rigours of lockdown life – there’ll be a main-stage revival of Pam Gems’ Piaf (from July 2). Artistic director Adam Penford says: “That will have two performances a week socially distanced, even though in theory we’re opening after [the capacity cap] has lifted. That’s one approach. How long they will need to be in place I don’t know. A Christmas Carol will be an expensive show to mount, so we need to be selling pretty near capacity to make that stack up. What’s interesting is that as we’ve moved existing ticket-bookers over to new dates, a few are opting to go to those socially distanced performances.” “It’s a clever idea,” reckons artistic director of the   Tom Morris, who’s examining that option and weighing up what to do about mooted vaccine passports. “You’ve got a classic conflict of rights. You’ve got some people who quite reasonably regard it as their right to go into an auditorium where everyone has been vaccinated or tested, and other people who quite reasonably regard it as their right to attend without having to be tested or vaccinated, for all sorts of reasons. There’s a lot of thinking going into this, not only in the theatre sector but in retail, pubs and restaurants – there are different versions of the same problem everywhere.” Does he have any interest in the possibility of some performances being targeted to those with Covid-status proof and some without? “I quite like the idea, but we need to work out whether it’s practical and whether people would welcome it. My instinct is that the solution which offers people a choice is going to be the best solution. If you have competing rights, you can’t have one solution that works ideally for everyone.” What about the  , which some have feared might be an endangered species after the Globe announced some interval-free Shakespeare productions last month? The rule of thumb during the last rounds of attempts to reopen theatres was to minimise running times and keep bar areas closed. The expectation is that the protocols for reopening in May will accord with previous guidelines, but clearly ‘back to normal’ suggests thronging foyers. “Everything need to be retested,” Morris replies. “In Bristol we’re aiming to try some experimental intervals in the early summer with a socially distanced audience, in which people actually move about. Radical! In the past, our audience has enjoyed intervals. They can be a showbusiness event in their own right.” James Dacre, artistic director of Royal & Derngate, Northampton, which boasts   in Four Quartets as part of its reopening offer, mounts the case for the defence too. “The magic of live performance can be better served by not having an interval, but there are many writers who use the interval as an opportunity to allow the audience to reflect, and move the story on. I think it’s actually going to be a creative decision. Yes, it will be informed by health and safety considerations, but looking further into the future really the decision is one of how best to tell the story.” In Sheffield, participating via the imminent World Snooker Championship at the   in the DCMS’s Event Research Programme (aimed at looking at audience behaviour, to help plan for reopening), artistic director Rob Hastie makes the point for many.  “When it comes to intervals, I think it will be case by case – deciding what the individual [project] needs and what our audience tells us it wants. Regardless of the official guidelines, we’re going to have to be listening hard to our audiences about what they feel comfortable and safe with. We’re going to be listening for months.” The Sheffield comeback season will be revealed shortly, but we do know what will be absent: “I think you’re unlikely to see a play about Covid – [that’s] one thing that people won’t want.” Last but not least, a slight gnashing of teeth is heard down the line from Porthcurno, near Penzance. Zoe Curnow, artistic director of the coastal open-air  , is able to reopen the venue as an outdoor museum from April 12, but most hold off until mid-May to resume performances (the venue is classified with large outdoor venues rather than other theatres). A few shows have been announced, more will follow.  She says: “What’s ludicrous is that from April 12, village communities can be staging fetes and community events run by people who probably haven’t staged a Covid-safe event yet, but I can’t stage a show despite having a good track record.” High caution, again, governs her approach. “I’ve programmed 2021 to be performable and financially viable at our socially distanced capacity.” Last year, the Minack lost £300,000 – a result of being closed through three prime trading months. But Curnow is looking on the bright side now: “So long as nothing slips on the roadmap, it won’t be anything like that bad this year. It’s just still very challenging for those us trying to sort out a season.” Indeed.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/will-trip-theatre-ever/
167,What's next for pop and rock: a live music boom and a fight for the industry's soul,"Covid-19 exposed fault lines in the popular music business. As the live sector ground to an economically devastating halt, one that threatened to destroy livelihoods, the recorded music sector enjoyed a streaming boom that patently failed to benefit the vast majority of music makers. One side appeared to be rolling in wealth as it threw, via social media, a year-long lockdown dance party for homebound consumers, while the other side was queuing up at food banks and railing against a fundamental, systemic imbalance of remuneration between creators and monetisers. This may be an age-old tension, but the effects of the pandemic brought new pressures to bear: it threw economic disparities into sharp relief and raised questions about whether the very structure of the music business was fit for the modern world.  As the immediate crisis passes, venue doors creak nervously open, underemployed musicians tune up their instruments, road crews pick up tools again, and fans get their glad rags and dancing shoes on, the big question is: has anything really changed? Is the music industry ready to address the deep inequities that have come to light during this long, strange year, or will everyone be so relieved just to be back on the beat that we’ll dance our troubles away, and hope for the best? In a few months’ time,  , sitting in theatres, or leaning against bars being bombarded by sound and lights and music (sweet music!). It should start with small venues opening at the end of May, followed by some big outdoor events as the summer heats up. A few brave (or foolhardy) festivals are determined to press ahead in August,   against the potential losses were a new strain of Covid to blow everything off course. By the fourth quarter, arenas should be booming to the sounds of the world’s greatest rock and pop stars, some desperate to replenish their coffers, others just desperate to strut their stuff again. There could yet be setbacks and delays. We may have to show vaccination passports at the doors to gain admission. I don’t expect venues to be as jam-packed as in days of yore. Caution and social distancing will remain priorities for many, and for some time to come. Of course, others will be ramming themselves into the heart of spontaneous mosh pits with devil-may-care abandon as soon as they’re allowed – or even if they’re not.  The appetite for young people (in particular) to get back into the fray has been demonstrated by the number of illegal raves breaking out during the past year, and once that party really gets started, it’s going to go off in all kinds of unpredictable ways. But across all age groups, there has been a patient acceptance of postponements (with low levels of concert ticket returns, as 87 per cent held on to purchases), alongside a healthy surge in sales since the Government announced its roadmap to recovery. Britain is not just ready to rock – it’s desperate to do so. A live boom is on its way. By 2022, there will be so many popular musicians on the road that revellers will be spoilt for choice. Live Nation, arguably the world’s largest events-promotion conglomerate, expects to have 45 major artists touring, when it would usually field half of that. The company lost 84 per cent of its revenue in 2020, but is planning for 2021 to be its busiest year, with Britain’s advanced vaccination programme putting us in the vanguard. “On a global basis, the show will be back,” according to CEO Michael Rapino. “It’ll be back as big as ever, [thanks to] consumer demand.” This is good news for fans, and a lifesaver for musicians. One thing that lockdown has made savagely clear is that live performance is the key income stream for the majority of working musicians. Time and again, we have heard tales of penury and hardship, even from household names. David Crosby, a world-famous American singer-songwriter and founding member of two beloved bands (folk rockers The Byrds and harmonising quartet Crosby Stills Nash and Young) sold off the rights to his entire catalogue last month, declaring “I can’t work, and streaming stole my money.” His music was bought by Iconic Artists, one of a new breed of aggressively acquisitive music focused investment funds much in the news. Market leaders    , Blondie, Nile Rodgers and Barry Manilow;  , meanwhile, sold his catalogue to Universal for over $300 million. By treating copyrights as long-term investments, such funds present themselves as artists’ champions, but others view them as asset-strippers exploiting the inequities of the current rights system. It’s a trend sure to gain further momentum over the coming months, as more big names take a pay-day, but one that only benefits established artists while contributing nothing to the long-term creative future of music. The online #BrokenRecords campaign started by Tom Gray, a member of British indie rockers Gomez, has gained significant traction by highlighting the microscopic royalty payments that streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube (owned by Google) pay to rights holders. Musicians and songwriters complained of being at the bottom of a digital food chain, receiving fractions of a penny for each song, with even those tiny dividends effectively being divided between multiple band members and songwriters after record companies have made all kinds of contractual deductions. At the heart of the controversy were complaints about a “winner takes all” system, based on market share, that only delivered substantial payments to superstars and supersized record labels; 78 per cent of Spotify’s royalties are paid to major labels and the major independent rights body Merlin. It caused enough of a stink to inspire a British parliamentary inquiry into the economics of streaming. The heads of record companies and streaming platforms queued up to declare that it was a perfectly fair and equitable system, and it wasn’t their fault if artists had negotiated such poor deals for themselves (I’m paraphrasing). They came across as mean-spirited and obstructive when confronted with the emotional testimony of members of   and Elbow, who spoke passionately on behalf of impoverished musicians and unemployed crew members. The critically-acclaimed, Mercury Prize-nominated, festival-headlining indie singer-songwriter Nadine Shah revealed that she’d had to move back in with her parents during lockdown because she could no longer pay her rent. To industry protests that the streaming system was perfectly transparent, Shah retorted: “What is transparent is that I am not being paid.” The truth is that this fight has been brewing for a decade. Streaming has replaced CDs, vinyl and even downloads as the mass-market distribution method of the digital online era. No one disputes that it is convenient and effective, with consumers paying monthly fees (or enduring the irritation of free advertising-supported models) to receive unlimited access to pretty much anything we want to listen to, all beamed directly to our devices. After more than a decade of decline, streaming has restored the recorded-music industry’s fortunes, and returned it to healthy growth, with a global streaming market estimated to be worth $26 billion in 2019. The pandemic thus accelerated existing trends, with everyone stuck at home eager for entertainment to while away the endless hours. The Record Industry of Association of America noted a 14.6 per cent growth in on-demand music services during the last year. Spotify alone added a billion euros’ worth of premium revenue as subscriptions boomed. Major labels are said to earn as much as $20 million a day from streaming.  But as Covid devastated the live industry, what became cruelly clear is that streaming’s trickle-down economics are not trickling down to the people who actually make the music. There are over 8 million artists touting their wares on Spotify, but just 7,500 earned $100,000 in 2020. That is just 0.09 per cent of musicians on Spotify, meaning: pretty much every recording musician in the world. And even that dismal figure is misleading, because it doesn’t account for profit division among bands and fellow rights-holders. “Streaming has been built by corporations for profit margins. It hasn’t been built with any sustainable cultural remit in mind,” is the view of Tom Gray, who argues that this is a historic opportunity for fans, players and industry alike to right some systemic wrongs. “It’s about collectively saying: we all recognise that this is problematic. We all recognise that this was never really right, and surely we’re all bright enough and dynamic enough and willing enough to do something about it.” What is emerging is a powerful grassroots argument for higher royalty rates, fairer record and publishing contracts reflecting new digital-distribution realities, and a user-centric payment system that connects listener’s fees directly with their favourite artists, rather than dispersing profits on the blunter market-share system. The latter is something we will be hearing a lot about in the coming year, as SoundCloud (a relatively small but significant streaming service) announced its adoption of what is being described as “fan-powered royalties”.  Some really big stars are getting involved here, lending a moral dimension to the campaign, since they are objecting to a system that has personally enriched them. “I want my (streaming) subscription to go to the people I play,”   of Abba insisted during the recent Radio 4 Front Row programme, The Price of Song. “With user-centric, you could be a niche artist with 3,000 loyal followers, and if they play you, you get all their subscriptions, which means you could actually live off that. But as it is now, it all goes to those mega artists who have billions of clicks. And that is one thing we could change. It’s completely unfair.” I expect this to become an ever more public battle over the next year, a struggle for the soul of the music industry. One possible consequence will be to greatly energise and empower a genuinely independent movement, where creators opt to retain all their own rights, supported by breakaway streaming platforms and a more artist-friendly network of independent music services. The major labels, with their huge budgets and global marketing reach, may continue to dominate the mass market, but it has been striking how many genuinely independent British artists reaped the benefits of loyal fanbases this past year. There were big chart-topping hit albums during lockdown for such fierce rock bands as Idles,  ,   and Architects, and uncompromising grime artists ,   and  .  When venues throw their doors open, who are those all-important young audiences going to be most desperate to see? Someone with a cute viral hit from an algorithmically-driven Spotify playlist – or the kind of artists who have struck deep bonds with fanbases through bloody-minded commitment to their art? If you add the kind of bold creative energy we see in the independent sector to a fan- and artist-driven campaign for change, then put it together with a revitalised live scene driven by the pent-up frustration of a young audience desperate for visceral thrills and human connection, it unlocks all kinds of thrilling possibilities. And this is my fondest hope for the future, that something will emerge that no one could have predicted: a new scene, a new style, a new attitude, a new way of doing business rather than a return to business as usual. There will be plenty of the latter, of course. What I can say with certainty is that there will be a dam-burst of new albums from all our favourite established stars in the next 18 months, and celebratory gigs from the biggest name in every popular musical genre. It’s going to be a good year ahead for music, wherever your tastes lie. But I’m also looking nervously and hopefully at the horizon for something fresh, something youthful, challenging and radical that might push music out of its comfort zone, scare the horses, rattle established practises, rewrite the rules, and shake the whole business to its foundations, whether we like it or not. Maybe it’s just a dream, one of those feverishly over-stimulated pandemic visions that have haunted so many of us this past 12 months. But wouldn’t it be satisfying if the end of lockdown offered pop music a whole new beginning?",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/next-pop-rock-live-music-boom-fight-industrys-soul/
168,Spot the fiendish Easter eggs hidden in great works of art,"The world’s   are crawling with hidden messages. A cipher here, a joke or seditious statement there. Once spotted or solved, these carefully concealed details can unlock a new reading of a painting altogether. Such elements are known, colloquially at least, as “Easter Eggs”. It’s a term borrowed from computer gaming, used to refer to extra levels, keys and so on that are built into the game for only the most dedicated players to find. They appear in other media too.   in his films are “eggs”, and Google is stuffed with them. For a few weeks in 2015, if you typed “a long time ago in a galaxy far far away” into its search bar, your screen temporarily resembled the scrolling crawl of the original   films. It is artists, though, who seem to take particular delight in the visual mischief that “eggs” require. Look closely at shiny objects in a still life and often there’s a miniscule face staring back at you.  ’s Bacchus (1595) and Clara Peeters’ Still Life with Cheeses, Almonds and Pretzels (c1615) contain these covert self-portraits. , meanwhile, hid a tiny hare in his painting Rain Steam and Speed (1844), and Gustave Klimt is said to have concealed images of blood cells in his 1907 painting The Kiss. The immunologist Karl Landsteiner was working on blood transfusions at the University of Vienna at the time, so I guess it’s feasible. Intrigued? Here, then, are a few other examples, to inspire an egg hunt of your own. Set into the floor of the first landing in the  ’s portico entrance is a marble mosaic, The Awakening of the Muses, by the Russian artist Boris Anrep (1885-1969). Despite its classical theme, Anrep, who came to Britain in the early 1900s, hid many famous faces of his day in the mosaic. Diana Mitford, for instance, is muse of song, Greta Garbo is Tragedy, Virginia Woolf is History, Winston Churchill, Defiance and Clive Bell, a rather more sober than is customary, Bacchus. Anrep told an interviewer: “If there is any feeling of squeamishness in walking over august personages one can easily step around them.” Made for King Richard II and named for  , near Salisbury, where this little folding altarpiece resided between 1705 and 1929, the diptych depicts Richard with Edmund the Martyr and Edward the Confessor (England’s patron saints), plus his personal patron, John the Baptist. They are presenting him to the Virgin and Christ Child. But within this broad framework there are puzzling symbols. Not least, the tiny image (it is less than an inch wide) of England, hidden in the orb at the top of the standard. Discovered when the diptych was restored in 1993, it shows a turreted castle on an island, floating in a silver sea. (If that’s ringing bells, it’s because Shakespeare’s Richard II contains the line “this little world, / This precious stone set in a silver sea,” so it’s tempting to think that Shakespeare knew the diptych).  often painted bathers in a landscape, but this one is special. Look carefully at the patch of sky directly above his right shoulder (so on the left of the painting) and the bluish-white clouds form the face of a bearded man in a bowler hat. Compare it to photographs of the artist from the 1880s, and it’s obviously a self-portrait. And, as Cézanne didn’t paint over it, we can assume it is deliberate. Why, though? It’s possible Cézanne was feeling unusually introspective at the time. He’d recently begun a doomed relationship with his family’s servant, and his father was gravely ill. Plus, his friendship with Émile Zola, whom he had known since childhood, was on the rocks. Serialisation of Zola’s novel The Masterpiece began that year, and its lead character – an artist tormented by a painting that eventually drives him to suicide – was significantly modelled, according to Zola’s journal, upon Cézanne. So many people remarked on it that the artist severed ties with Zola the following year. Michelangelo’s interest in anatomy (kindled by the public dissections he saw as a teen and later performed himself) lasted all his life. He even conceived of a book on anatomy for artists, though it didn’t come to fruition. It’s perfectly believable, then, that his Sistine Chapel ceiling is laced with secret renderings of the insides of the human body. Neuroanatomists have recognised a shoulder joint on the body of a sibyl, a vertebra in Holofernes and, most famously, a cutaway of the skull in the cloak surrounding God as he creates Adam. If you watched the TV series Westworld, you’ll recall Dr Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) explaining that hidden skull shape. Michelangelo, Ford says, meant to imply that “the divine gift does not come from a higher power, but from our own minds”. The Da Vinci Code author   is only one in a long line of people to have found hidden meanings in Leonardo’s paintings. In 2010, an Italian researcher named Silvano Vinceti found the letter “S” in the Mona Lisa’s left eye and “LV” in her right. Does the “S” mean the subject is from Milan’s Sforza dynasty? Vinceti thinks so. When it comes to The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (c1503), Sigmund Freud detected the silhouette of a vulture in the Madonna’s blue robes. The bird, according to the psychiatrist, referred to Leonardo’s latent homosexuality. In The Virgin of the Rocks (c1483-6), meanwhile, the palm tree’s resemblance to a scallop shell challenges the Church’s conception of Creation (a shell in the mountains proved the peaks were once seabeds, Leonardo wrote in his notebooks, meaning Earth was made tumultuously over eons, rather than by God’s hand in a few days). As for the Last Supper, while Brown believed the 1498 painting pointed to a relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalene, an Italian musician has suggested that the rolls on the table and the apostles’ hands work as musical notes on a stave.

169,Hunter Biden new memoir details him 'buying crack cocaine on streets of DC and binging on vodka',"Joe Biden’s son Hunter has written about how he would buy crack cocaine on the streets of DC and binge on vodka most mornings while his father was vice president, in a new memoir that offers a frank account of his drug addiction. Hunter Biden, the president’s second son, has opened up for the first time about his decades-long struggle with alcohol and drugs and how his father helped him on his path to sobriety.  The 51-year-old tells how his first drink was a glass of champagne aged eight, leading to a lifetime of abusing drink and then hard drugs. “I’ve bought crack cocaine on the streets of Washington, DC, and cooked up my own inside a hotel bungalow in Los Angeles,” Hunter, whose mother was Mr Biden's late first wife Neilia, writes in the prologue to “Beautiful Things,”  “I’ve been so desperate for a drink that I couldn’t make the one-block walk between a liquor store and my apartment without uncapping the bottle to take a swig,”  “In the last five years alone, my marriage has dissolved, guns have been put in my face, and at one point I dropped clean off the grid, living in $59 (£43)-a-night Super 8 motels off I-95 while scaring my family even more than myself.” The situation became so bad he even let a homeless addict he bought crack from move in with him. He tells how he was in and out of rehab in his 20s and relapsed after seven years, effectively ending his lucrative lobbying career. Hunter returned to rehab in his 40s, before relapsing again in 2016 after his older brother Beau died of cancer. His father, who was then US Vice President under Barack Obama, arrived at his home and said, “I know you’re not fine, Hunter. You need help.”  Hunter recalls: “He grabbed me, swung me around and hugged me. He held me tight in the dark and cried for the longest time. He never let me forget that all was not lost. He never abandoned me, never shunned me, never judged me, no matter how bad things got — and believe me, from there they would get much, much worse.” Private videos and emails from Hunter’s laptop were leaked to the press last year, when Mr Biden was campaigning for the 2020 election. Hunter insists he is now sober, and credits new wife Melissa Cohen and their young son for his sobriety.  ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/hunter-biden-writes-new-memoir-would-buy-crack-cocaine-streets/
170,Michel Barnier says 'au revoir' to Brussels - with a parting shot at Ursula von der Leyen,"So farewell then Michel Barnier, who has finally left the European Commission after about 15 years in the upper echelons of Brussels power-broking.  Had it not been for Brexit, the urbane Frenchman would be best remembered in Britain for his spell as Internal Market Commissioner, during which he introduced a raft of post-financial crisis regulation. After two spells as a commissioner, it looked like Mr Barnier’s time in Brussels ended with his failed bid to become commission president in 2014. But he was brought back as a senior advisor on defence by Jean-Claude Juncker, the man who beat him to the post.  In the wake of the 2016 referendum, Mr Barnier lobbied hard to become the chief Brexit negotiator and got a job that would consume his daily life for the next four and a half years.  The role made him that most rare of things; a European politician with pan-EU recognition.  In 2019, he may have nursed hopes that his profile would translate into a call from EU leaders to become the new commission president or perhaps the bloc’s chief diplomat.  That call never came with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron opting to parachute in Ursula von der Leyen as a compromise candidate instead.  Mr Barnier, a staunch Gaullist, was not to Mr Macron’s political tastes. The French president could yet regret the move as Mr Barnier’s attentions have now turned to reviving the fortunes of Les Républicains ahead of presidential elections next year.  Mr Barnier’s regular tours of European capitals, were appreciated by EU governments, especially Ireland, which is the member state most directly affected by Brexit.  He appeared a comparative rock of stability as he saw off one British prime minister and welcomed no fewer than four British Brexit negotiators to Brussels.  Mr Barnier made no secret of the fact he viewed Brexit, which he termed a “school of patience”, as a lesson that had to be taught and learnt. This didacticism, to British ears, could often stray into pompous and repetitive lecturing on the supposed sanctity of the Single Market.  Avoiding no deal and keeping 27 member states broadly on board with the EU position for so long was a considerable achievement.   A few flashes of temper aside though, he maintained his composure under significant pressure.  Mr Barnier could be inflexible, which is a charge he finds particularly irritating. His supporters would paint this as a resolute defence of EU rules and interests, which proved justified when the UK caved late in areas such as fishing.  But his rigid refusal to hold negotiations in a swathe of sectors until there was progress on the three toughest areas did cost valuable time that could have been used to flesh out the final trade deal.  The final trade deal was closer to the British vision, even if it came at an economic cost to Britain, than Mr Barnier’s ambition of a more comprehensive agreement.  Lord Frost was simply not prepared to sacrifice UK sovereignty, even if it meant added trade friction, and Mr Barnier was not prepared to compromise on his interpretation of single market rules by allowing “cherry-picking”.  In his farewell speech in Zurich on Wednesday night, Mr Barnier listed the economic costs of Brexit but he also issued some veiled criticism of the European Commission.  It is an open secret in Brussels that Mr Barnier was not consulted in January when Ursula von der Leyen   to enforce a vaccine export ban against the UK.  Mr Barnier, who views the preservation of the invisible Irish border as his major success, was not impressed.  Judging by his comments on Wednesday, he continues to be dissatisfied with Mrs von der Leyen’s confrontational approach to the vaccines supplies dispute with Britain. , which has irked many in the upper echelons of the commission.  “There is no place, in such a serious situation, for polemics and competition. There are so many more reasons to cooperate, in the short and the long term,"" he said.  Mrs von der Leyen, a comparative rookie in the world of Brussels politics, would do well to listen to the veteran’s advice as UK-EU negotiations over vaccines continue this week.    -  ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/02/michel-barnier-says-au-revoir-brussels-parting-shot-ursula/
171,"Sodden sheet music, an unruly horse and other tales from the life of a royal composer","It is 3:45pm on June 3 2012 and I am standing on a barge on the Thames with a conductor’s baton in my hand. In front of me is a 25-piece orchestra, to my left and right, sail vessels of all shapes and sizes, from steamboats and tugs to narrowboats, pleasure cruisers and Dunkirk’s famous Little Ships; and up ahead, moored at Tower Bridge, the Spirit of Chartwell, a 210ft-long barge lavishly decorated in red, gold and purple, carrying the Queen, Prince Philip, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and  . It is the   and, after five months carefully crafting my Water Music movement, Gigue, and a long, wet, windy day, which started at 7.30am at Vauxhall Bridge, and has spanned a 9am rehearsal and a slow, stately procession down the river, I am finally in full flow, leading the musicians as we approach the massed ranks of the broadcast media and the expectant royal party. Then disaster! As a fortissimo brass chord rings out, a mighty gust blows across our bows and my sheet music flies away, landing in a large puddle on the deck five yards astern. Irretrievable – and now unreadable in any case due to sogginess. The only thing I can do is half-close my eyes, visualise the score and conduct the rest of the piece from memory. Happily, the drenched musicians rise to the occasion. I like to think their laughter is sympathetic. Not all my royal commissions have been quite as hair-raising. Alongside my TV and film work, I’ve been privileged to be commissioned to write works for several royal ceremonial events, including the Queen’s   celebrations in 2016; the opening of the new Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre, in 2018; and the Edwardian Pageant at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, in 2019. All these undertakings have posed similar challenges: finding the right tone – a balance between refined dignity and uplifting ceremony; composing music that can be heard in a live arena; and sticking to very specific timings. The potential for musical disarray is ever-present. At the coronation of King Edward VII, in 1902, the director of music Sir Frederick Bridge misjudged his timings, resulting in the orchestra finishing the royal anthem before the King had arrived at the ceremony. Bridge was saved by the organist who improvised in the interim; a familiar experience for anyone who has played for a church wedding. My piece for the Diamond Jubilee Pageant was composed specifically with brass to the fore, as the sound of brass instruments travels well across large spaces. For the Queen’s 90th birthday, I was commissioned to write the Overture and Finale music. Again, it was to be performed in a large outdoor space – the wonderful grounds of Windsor Castle. And again, I featured brass for this reason. One particular piece – The Buckingham Palace March – had to be played by the orchestra and a mounted military band simultaneously, which presented the challenge of keeping everyone in time from a distant podium. Remarkably, it worked a treat and the ultimate reward for me was that the audience started clapping along! When I composed the music for the opening of the new DNRC, a £300 million centre at the Stanford Hall Estate, in Nottinghamshire, I was briefed by the director of the DNRC Programme, General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman, that my music was to be played during the entrance of Prince William, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries, and had to finish exactly as they reached their seats, at which point we were to strike up the National Anthem. I was conducting the National Symphony Orchestra on the day – with an inclement wind once again threatening to scatter the scores, which on this occasion were clamped to the music stands with clothes pegs (I’d learned my lesson from the Diamond Jubilee Pageant) – and was watching carefully to make sure the orchestra played its final chord exactly as the Prince reached his seat. It was important for it to be note-perfect as well as time-perfect, and we had various repeat bars up our sleeves and all sorts of looks, nods and winks pre-arranged between me and the orchestra which would give them the sign that another repeat was required… or not! Musicians are excellent at following these various signals from a conductor. Events involving animals require even more “belts and braces”. At the Edwardian Pageant, a celebration of King Edward VII’s life and reign, my music had to fit in precisely with the many different performances unfolding in the arena, including a “Shetland Pony Grand National”, and displays by the Household Cavalry and the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, to name but a few. In total, 900 horses were involved. One night, one of the horses who was playing a starring role didn’t want to come into the arena at all; a couple of his friends decided to join him in solidarity with his strike, and this called for the belt and braces music to be played while the dissenters were cajoled back onstage. The key to everything is flexibility; to make sure that all eventualities are covered, and most importantly to have a good backup plan in place! People often ask me if I consult the Royal Family directly when commissioned to write something for a royal event. The answer is no, but I have relied heavily on advice and guidance from the producer and creative director of Royal Windsor events, Simon Brooks-Ward, his assistant producer, Simon Garrett, and the artistic director of the Pageants, Dougie Squires. All of them have been invaluable to me in my quest to craft the perfect royal soundtrack and we have spent many hours together in my home studio round the piano. I always play them first drafts of my compositions, to give them an idea of timing and mood, before I complete the full orchestration, and they often make suggestions, such as injecting the music with more drama or energy, based on their many years of experience of these events. My latest royal project, by contrast, is an album, The Music of Kings and Queens, composed to mark the Queen’s 95th birthday. Over 67 minutes, I have tried to depict the characters of 12 selected monarchs, using the full force of a symphony orchestra (again relying on the invaluable assistance of Simon Brooks-Ward). A selection of these pieces will be featured on my new Sunday night series for Classic FM, Music for Monarchy. Each monarch, with their various personalities, presented individual musical challenges, while also at the same time suggesting with their stories which instruments might be their “voices”; for example, to the beleaguered but determined Queen Anne, I gave the voice of a solo stringed instrument. For Queen Elizabeth II, I opened with a brass fanfare, before leading into a dignified melody, featuring strings playing in rich, close harmony, to signify her selfless service and devotion to duty. Royal patronage of music colleges, military bands, musical charities, orchestras, opera houses and ballet companies has been a key to their survival for centuries. The Prince of Wales alone is patron to 24 musical organisations. The Royal Family’s support for music through the years has been constant and steadfast; and composing and performing music for royalty has been a privilege and a pleasure for me on each and every occasion.",Culture,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/sodden-sheet-music-unruly-horse-tales-life-royal-composer/

Tehran, however, has said Washington must end the sanctions before it will make any moves to get back in line. The US is trying to use Europe as an intermediary with Iran after the Islamic Republic refused to join direct talks with the Biden administration. The Vienna meeting will aim at drawing up two separate agreements, one with the US and one with Iran on which steps they will take when to return to compliance with the agreement. The two sides will not meet directly. The US would not insist on retaining sanctions, the Telegraph understands, believing that the previous “maximum pressure” campaign waged by the Trump administration  Ned Price, US State Department spokesman, on Friday called the talks a ""healthy step forward"" and said that Washington ""remains open"" to a direct encounter with Tehran. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said he was optimistic the US was willing to compromise. He added: “I very much hope that the anti-Iranian inertia that was observed at first will give way to common sense.” It comes after a year of quiet diplomacy that has failed to produce much headway. The aim is to reach an agreement within two months, said a senior official with the EU, the coordinator of the deal. ""If we don’t get there [within that time frame] ...it will be definitely bad news,"" the official told Reuters. Signatories to the deal are hoping to make headway before Iran holds presidential elections in June, a milestone that could lead to a new Iranian negotiating team and more delays. However, any return of the US would involve complications. Since the US withdrawal from the pact, Iran has been steadily violating its restrictions, like the amount of enriched uranium it can stockpile and the purity to which it can enrich it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that over the past two years, Iran has accumulated a lot of nuclear material and new capacities and used the time for ""honing their skills in these areas."" At home, Mr Biden has to contend with opposition from Republicans in the Senate, most of whom opposed the deal - which was signed by the Obama government - in the first place.

173,Jill Biden dons wig and air hostess costume to give passengers April Fools' Day surprise,"Jill Biden, who is known for her love of practical jokes, gave journalists an April Fools' Day Surprise to remember on a flight back to the White House from California.  During meal service on Thursday, a flight attendant wearing a airline costume an a dark wig with a “Jasmine” name tag passed out ice cream bars.  The First Lady later returned, whipped off the wig and shouted “April Fools'” as she revealed her identity, according to a report from reporters onboard Executive One Foxtrot. Members of the media were fooled - but so were members of the former school teacher’s staff. ""The pool [of reporters] was indeed totally fooled but takes comfort in the fact that none of FLOTUS’ staff recognised Dr. Biden in disguise either,"" wrote journalist Emily Goodin from the MailOnline, using the First Lady of the United States acronym. ""The pool laughed. FLOTUS, laughing and visibly pleased with her prank, returned to her cabin. ""The ice cream bars – vanilla with a hard chocolate coating – were delicious."" Mrs Biden was pictured later disembarking from the plane wearing an all-black ensemble with black patterned tights. Mrs Biden, who met with farm workers and visited a vaccination site in California during her Thursday trip, enjoys pranks. In her memoir, she recounted that when her husband was vice president, she hid in an overhead bin on Air Force Two and surprised someone looking to stow luggage, according to The Associated Press. President Joe and Jill Biden’s grandchildren last year revealed their grandmother can be somewhat of a jokester in a promotional video played on the second night of the Democratic National Convention. “I would say she’s not your average grandmother,” granddaughter Natalie Biden said. ""She's a prankster, she's very mischievous."" ""When she goes on a run, sometimes she'll find like a dead snake and she'll pick it up and put it in a bag and she'll use it to scare someone,"" Natalie Biden said. Mr Biden previously revealed April Fools' Day is ""like a tradition"" for his wife's family and he wakes up every April 1 worrying “what in the hell is Jill going to do this time? I feel so stupid.” Mrs Biden, 69, has said of her practical jokes: “I’ve always believed you’ve got to steal the joyful moments when you can,” she wrote. Others in past administrations have played April Fools' Day pranks. As first lady, Barbara Bush wore a strawberry blonde wig to a Gridiron dinner on April 1, 1989.

174,Former Brexit Party MEP dies in Bahamas diving accident,"A former Brexit Party MEP has died in a diving accident, Nigel Farage has announced. Robert Rowland has been described as a “larger than life character” who was “enthusiastic” in his opposition to the European Union. The former politician and fund manager died yesterday near his family home in the Bahamas, according to a statement issued by Brexit Party founder Mr Farage. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that a man had been found on the seabed during a fishing trip aboard a 39-foot boat off the Caribbean islands on Saturday afternoon. A police report has stated that a member of the party spearfishing in the area of tourist destination Exuma Cays did not resurface. Mr Rowland represented the party as an MEP for South East England from 2019 until the constituency's abolition when the UK exited the EU on January 31 2020 “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of Robert Rowland, after a diving accident near his home in the Bahamas,” Mr Farage said in a statement through Brexit Party successor the Reform Party. “Following a successful career in the City, Robert was an enthusiastic Brexit Party MEP and larger than life character. “On behalf of myself, and all those who were involved with the Brexit Party, I extend our sincerest condolences to his family”. Mr Rowland was married to wife Lisa Marie, and had four children. Police on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas are investigating the incident After studying at Newcastle University, where he was first introduced to political activism, he worked in the financial sector with several asset management companies. He was elected with a number of colleagues in 2019 as Mr Farage's party won 29 seats in the European elections. Former Brexit Party colleague David Bull told the Daily Express: ""Robert was the kindest, most gentle, thoughtful friend. He was deliciously funny, dry, intelligent, erudite and compassionate. ""He was a huge support to me in the European Parliament and when I was campaigning in the General Election. “He was a true team player. We started as colleagues and ended up as the closest of friends.” Alongside his political activities Mr Rowland also supported Tickets for Troops, a military charity offering free tickets to music, sports, and entertainment events to members of the Armed Forces. The charity said in a statement:  “We are devastated to hear of the passing of Robert Rowland, a committed and generous board member to TFT.

175,,"Women are the majority of the population, so our votes count. Obviously we are not a homogenous group. Yet increasingly I hear women voice their political homelessness. Many such women are Left-leaning and have previously voted Labour, Lib Dem or Green, but now they feel unwanted. They feel alienated – dumped by the political parties they once supported, for their refusal to discuss women’s rights under the guise that these discussions are now ‘transphobic’. The Stonewall tactic of ‘no debate’ has been highly successful. We saw it recently when Sadiq Kahn was asked by a member of the London Assembly about the definition of women he’d once put in a tweet: “You’ve said trans women are women – so do you think some women have male reproductive organs?”. Six other members of the Assembly jumped in to shut down debate and supported a subsequent motion to prevent him from having such a discussion with the mayor. His  speech was deemed discriminatory. Whether this member of the Assembly was genuinely interested in women’s rights, or just wanted to pick a fight with Khan isn’t the issue. For me, it is that respectable politicians aren’t willing to define what a woman is. And they are certainly not shy about putting definitions to other people and causes. In the latest report by the Labour Party, “ ” the aim is laudable: to increase representation of trans people in the party and make sure they can take part in all activities safely and “without fear”. It’s a shame no such consultation was ever held about protecting its female Jewish MPs, but there you go. Much of the defining of transphobia is as you would expect until you get to this: “claiming there is a ‘conflict’ between trans people’s rights and women’s or other communities is transphobic.” Herein madness lies. To ask a question or have a disagreement about single sex spaces is transphobic? The word not only becomes meaningless, it loses all contact with the real world. Ask most of us if we support trans rights and we’ll say yes, but when asked if those who have not transitioned in any meaningful way can enter single sex spaces, then the majority are unhappy or just have some questions about it. To not even have this discussion is now considered a win for lobby groups, but it is a loss to many politically active women. Lifelong activists have been threatened with expulsion from the Labour Party and told they must be “re-educated”. These are women who have set up refuges and run trade unions. Is all this a vote-winning exercise? I have heard of canvassers shouting TERF (Trans exclusionary radical feminists) at women on the doorstep when they simply asked about women’s rights. Way to go! The Lib Dems are also fully subscribed to this groovy gender ideology. The likes of Layla Moran spout stuff about not caring about bodies, but seeing into people’s souls. This is the equivalent of those well-meaning liberals who “don’t see colour” and  is frankly, insulting. Many Lib Dem women are unhappy, and the news that one of  their big donors is a company that makes puberty blockers (Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) is more than uncomfortable. The Greens, who don’t like GM crops, suddenly seem to be embracing the case for puberty-blocking hormones and are so fully gender fluid that women exist simply now as “non-men”. The Greens have also embraced Aimee Knight, née Challenor, who is trans, as a Green Candidate for Coventry City Council. When she stood in the 2018 deputy leadership contest, her agent was her father, David who was sentenced to prison for 22 years for the rape and torture of a 10-year-old-girl in the family home. Aimee then joined the Lib Dems but was suspended in 2019 after tweets appeared on her partner’s account about fantasising about sex with children. She has since said the account appeared to have been hacked and the comments were not posted by her fiancé. The key point is, that in order to embrace fashionable diversity, key checks seem to have been overlooked. In Scotland, women have been thrown under every available bus. The women who accused Salmond of inappropriate behaviour at the recent inquiry are now simply irrelevant. Its new Hate Crime Bill does little to actually make the lives of trans people better, but is an attempt to appear more progressive than England .  Bit by bit, women’s sex-based rights are being eroded. Parties formed to protect the environment or to achieve independence have fallen over themselves to get in with the trans rights movement . So there is now a huge number of floating voters who are not anti-trans, but simply want to keep our sex- based rights and protections. Many of us are not Tories. So which savvy political party might speak for us or even recognise that we exist? We are met only with fear, abuse and silence.

176,Red Wall by-election fight for Keir Starmer after MP resigns following harassment allegations,"Sir Keir Starmer is set to face the first test of his leadership at the polls in May, after a Red Wall MP stood down on Tuesday following sexual harassment allegations. Mike Hill, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, resigned his seat weeks before an employment tribunal is to hear sexual harassment and victimisation allegations against him. His departure will trigger a by-election in one of the Labour Party’s most vulnerable seats, which Mr Hill retained with a significantly reduced vote share at the 2019 election after the chairman of the Brexit Party stood against him. The by-election could see Paul Williams, another Labour Red Wall MP who lost his seat in 2019, take on the Conservatives and Richard Tice, now chairman of the rebranded Brexit Party, Reform UK. Mr Hill was suspended from the Labour Party in September 2019 over sexual assault allegations, but readmitted after his accuser’s complaint to the party was “parked”, pending the outcome of an investigation by Parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Process. An employment tribunal for sexual harassment and victimisation will begin at the London Central Employment Tribunal on May 10. Mr Hill strongly denies the allegations. It is understood that he met with Nick Brown, Labour’s chief whip, on Tuesday morning and made the decision to resign. The by-election in Hartlepool is expected to take place alongside the local elections on May 6.  The Telegraph understands the leadership of Hartlepool’s local Labour association is planning to install Mr Williams as their candidate for the by-election on a single-candidate shortlist. Mr Williams is currently the Labour candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in Cleveland, but plans to stand instead for the Hartlepool seat in an attempt to return to Parliament. He was previously the MP for Stockton South. The secretary of the Hartlepool Constituency Labour Party, Anth Frain, has written to other members to express concern that choosing Mr Williams, a moderate candidate, without a full selection process will be seized upon by hard-Left Labour members as a fait accompli by allies of Sir Keir. Mr Frain has privately warned senior figures in the CLP that hard-Left members will have to be reassured Mr Williams was the choice of local members rather than Sir Keir’s office. Labour’s vote share in Hartlepool dropped by almost 15 per cent at the 2019 election, following a surge in support for the Brexit Party candidate, Mr Tice. Mr Tice now leads Reform UK, the Brexit Party's successor, and told The Telegraph he was ""actively considering"" standing again. ""We've obviously got some big decisions to make and a lot depends on when the by-election is,"" he said. ""I'm the only one that stands for cutting taxes for the least well off and the lowest paid amongst any of the parties. I think actually there's a very clear agenda that works for the people of Hartlepool."" Mr Tice said if he did decide to stand, the Conservative Party should withdraw their candidate to increase his chance of beating Labour. ""The Tories should say: 'No, Richard, you stand, and let's damage Keir Starmer',"" he said. ""That puts Labour in a right pickle."" A Tory source responded: ""[Tice] doesn’t care about the people of Hartlepool. All he cares about is climbing the political career ladder.” The Conservatives finished second at the last election, but have opened up as the odds-on favourites at 1-2 to win the by-election. Labour are 13-8 to retain the seat, according to the bookmaker Coral. A Labour Party spokesman said: “Mike Hill has resigned as Member of Parliament for Hartlepool with immediate effect.”",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/16/red-wall-by-election-fight-keir-starmer-hartlepool-mp-resigns/
177,The mistake Remainers make about the British Empire,"Telegraph readers might be inclined to overlook Empireland because it’s praised on the cover by Lefty shock jock James O’Brien (death by endorsement) but, trust me, it’s better than that. The subject is timely. With statues being tossed in rivers and the  , it feels as if the Right regards the past as the repository of civilisation and the Left sees it as a closet packed with skeletons of dead racists, but the reality of the British Empire, says Sathnam Sanghera, was infinitely more complex. It was acquired, as Sir John Seeley famously described it, “in a fit of absence of mind”. Far from a coherent project, let alone a conspiracy, Sanghera calls it “unplanned” and “nebulous… it was never a legal entity, and had no constitution or emperor issuing top-down laws”. It was also controversial in its own time. When Robert Clive, the man credited with laying the foundations of the empire in India, died in 1774, he was buried in an unmarked grave; his crimes had been so great, said Samuel Johnson, that his conscience compelled him to cut his own throat. , now sitting in our museums, were recognised by contemporaries for what they were: booty. At the conclusion to the Mahdist War (1881-99) in East Africa, the Mahdi’s tomb was raided and his skull presented to Lord Kitchener as a gift, who toyed with turning it into an “ink stand or drinking cup” before depositing it with the College of Surgeons, an episode that Queen Victoria regarded as embarrassingly medieval. Throughout the 1846-7 Xhosa War in South Africa, “heads were taken and traded as souvenirs”. There were imperial projects of enlightenment and improvement, yes, and many Britons so fell in love with cultures they encountered that they “went native” – for good and ill. By the 1880s, almost half the British troops in parts of Bengal had an STD. One British officer, far from the embodiment of the “stiff upper lip”, attempted sexual intercourse with literally everything he encountered, animal or mineral, including “a papaya, which proved more satisfying than a melon”. I am sold on the larger part of Sanghera’s thesis, that the empire could be rotten and we don’t know enough about it. I’m not sold on the claim that no doubt attracts O’Brien, that . Brexit, Remainers often say, was informed by a myth of British exceptionalism, that because we once ran large parts of the world, we thought we didn’t need Europe and could go it alone. To prove this, the author quotes a lot of Boris Johnson, an admirer of Churchill who recites Kipling, but the PM is the product of a very unusual public school education – and Brexit was made possible by the support of the working-class, many of whom have never travelled further afield than the Costa del Sol. We are invited to swallow the paradox that the general public are simultaneously ignorant of empire and obsessed with it. If we are uneducated – and a lot of what Sanghera documents is news to me – then I’d add that there’s a lot that defines us that we don’t know about, such as the Vikings, the civil war or the Wycliffe Bible. Historical amnesia is not limited to the long 19th century. But the Left focuses on that period, with some justification, because modern Britain emerged from the twin experiences of industry and colonisation, hence empire speaks to our contemporary concerns around class and race. We are, as Sanghera notes, a multicultural country thanks to empire, yet the empire was also “a wilful, unapologetic exercise in white racial supremacy” that dehumanised black people “on a super-industrial scale”. Whites were persuaded that they were top of the food chain and had a God-given right to be in charge – yet also, when the colonised began to migrate here, vulnerable to invasion. Travel beyond the playing fields of Eton, however, and you’ll find that many people voted for Brexit not to run the world but step back from it, to work on unfinished business back home. Granted, a lot of far-Right boobs backed Brexit, but so did plenty of moderates, some socialists and a roughly a quarter of non-white voters. If they wanted to turn the clock back to any particular moment, it was probably the 1950s, to an imagined time of safe streets and strong communities – to welfare state Britain, not the buccaneering British Empire. A far greater shadow is cast over the present by the Second World War, which is popularly remembered not as a defence of empire (which it was) but as a fight for democracy against fascism – against imperialism, if you will. Sanghera’s point, I guess, is that we are unconscious citizens of Empireland: empire made us, whether we realise it or not. He might be correct, but no one likes being told “I know you better than you know yourself”, and I suspect that the reason why many take offence at the attempt to “decolonise” high streets or the school curriculum is not because they are protective of empire but because they see it as an attempt to politicise their culture and daily life. They also suspect that history is being invoked to compel us to think or behave a certain way, that because Britain is guilty of crimes in the past, we must shuffle into the future with an embarrassed air, perpetually voting for whatever liberals want, to prove that we aren’t as bad as our ancestors were. The history is on Sanghera’s side. The facts speak for themselves.

Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said he was concerned the recent furore over Mr Salmond and the ""institutional failures"" uncovered threatened to inflict similar damage on Holyrood that the Daily Telegraph's investigation of MP expenses did on Westminster. Speaking to a virtual Holyrood press gallery lunch, he said that political games had been played ""on a very, very serious issue around a harassment inquiry"" and ""we have, I'm afraid, at times allowed the parliament to descend and the government to  He said the commission would consult on ideas to ensure MSPs can better hold the SNP government to account ""and win back the trust of the people."" A Scottish Labour consultation will explore reforming freedom of information legislation to create a presumption in favour of ""proactive publication"" after the SNP Government redacted swathes of documents dealing with its unlawful investigation into Mr Salmond. It will also propose introducing the same parliamentary privilege at Holyrood than MPs have at Westminster so they have equal protection from being sued for defamation. Tory MP David Davis, a friend of Mr Salmond's, to disclose SNP messages he said indicated a ""criminal conspiracy"" against the former First Minister. However, MSPs do not have the same level of legal protection in the Holyrood chamber. Labour also wants to examine the election of committee conveners by the whole Scottish Parliament instead of parties amid concerns that some committee members bow to party demands rather than following the evidence. Voters would be given the power to recall MSPs in exceptional circumstances after Derek Mackay, the SNP Finance Secretary, was caught in February last year sending sleazy messages to a schoolboy.  He  and has not been seen at Holyrood since. However, he did not quit as the Renfrewshire North and West MSP and continued to claim expenses. In addition, Labour proposed splitting the role of Lord Advocate, who is both the Scottish Government's most senior law officer and the head of the Crown Office. The tension between the two roles came to the fore when the current incumbent, James Wolffe, demanded the Spectator redact Mr Salmond's evidence to the Holyrood inquiry to remove some parts dealing with allegations Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. Unveiling the consultation, Mr Sarwar said: ""We are rightly proud of our role in establishing a devolved parliament, but we have to accept that trust and faith in parliament has been lost in recent years. ""We cannot allow the circus that has defined the start of this campaign or the institutional failures that defined the Salmond inquiry to run over into the Parliament of the next five years."" Drawing parallels with the Westminster expenses scandal, he warned against assuming that a furore involving one party or politician ""doesn't impact on the entire institution and the entire body of our politics - it does.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/02/labour-launch-clean-holyrood-commission-following-snp-sleaze/
179,"Lord Greaves, Lancashire Lib Dem who fought Paddy Ashdown all the way over deals with Labour – obituary","Lord Greaves, who has died suddenly aged 78, was a radical, independent-minded Yorkshireman who pioneered – from his base at Colne in Lancashire – the Liberal Party’s “community politics” which in the 1970s revived its fortunes in much of the country, A councillor in Colne for 42 years out of 50 until his death, Tony Greaves was a thorn in the side of party leaders from David Steel to Nick Clegg; it was Charles Kennedy who secured him a life peerage. Greaves was a leading dissident as Steel formed the Liberals’ alliance with the SDP, and broke with Steel’s drive for a merger after the 1987 election – though he soon became a Liberal Democrat himself. He was among the severest critics of  ’s efforts to develop close ties with New Labour. Ashdown described one party policy session in 1998 with Greaves at full throttle as “probably the worst meeting I have ever attended”. Greaves was convinced, from the outset, that Clegg’s coalition with David Cameron was a “bad idea”, saying no-one had had time to think the implications through. He stood for Parliament three times, but his strength was as a counterweight to Westminster. As secretary up to 1985 of the Association of Liberal Councillors, and subsequently the guru of local political activism, he was consistently suspicious of policies – and deals – hatched in London. In Colne, Greaves was respected across the party divide for his commitment to the town, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Pendle district. One fellow councillor described him as “a force of political nature”. Anthony Robert Greaves was born in Bradford on July 27 1942, the son of Geoffrey Greaves and the former Moyra Brookes. From Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, he read Geography at Hertford College, Oxford, then taught at Colne Grammar School. Greaves made his mark at the 1970 Liberal Assembly, introducing the motion that committed the party to “community politics” – campaigning on the doorstep to secure initially small improvements that mattered to local people. He served on Colne council (and its successor, Pendle) from 1971, and from 1973 to 1997 was also a county councillor. He fought Nelson & Colne at both 1974 elections, and Pendle in 1997. Editing the party magazine New Outlook, Greaves backed Steel for the leadership against John Pardoe. But he made Steel’s life uncomfortable as secretary of the Association of Liberal Councillors, then as a member of the party’s policy machinery who had started his own publishing house (he was later a second-hand book dealer). When Steel moved to merge with the SDP, Greaves was initially one of the Liberals’ negotiators – but pulled out of the team just before it concluded the infamous “dead parrot” policy document on the merger negotiations. From 2000 he brought to the Lords a whiff of social activism, and to the parliamentary party a resistance to reforms by Menzies Campbell and, subsequently, Clegg. In 2013 he aroused controversy by making light of accusations by four Lib Dem women of sexual harassment from his fellow Lib Dem Lord Rennard, writing: “We don’t know the details, but it is hardly an offence for one adult person to make fairly mild sexual advances to another. What matters is whether they are rebuffed. If the allegations as made are a matter for resignation, around a half of the male members of the Lords over 50 would probably not be seen again.” He later accused the complainants – who by then had left the party – of “a deliberate vendetta” against Rennard. Greaves was vice-president of the Local Government Association, and the Open Spaces Society. In 1988 he published, with Rachael Pitchford, Merger: the inside story. In 1968 Greaves married Heather Baxter, who survives him with their two daughters.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2021/03/24/lord-greaves-lancashire-lib-dem-fought-paddy-ashdown-way-deals/

They argue that with more than half the adult population having  , those who want to return to the office should be allowed to do so. While a detailed Government   has been published, clarity on when people will no longer be advised to work at home if possible is yet to emerge. It is being looked at as part of review of  , with changes expected to come in at June 17 at the earliest. Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs, told The Telegraph: ""If we don't end working from home then the businesses dependent on offices full of people will be in existential difficulty. That's why Boris Johnson should follow the data and get us back to the office as soon as is safe and feasible. ""With the vulnerable vaccinated and the link between hospitalisations and deaths now broken, I would have thought the Prime Minister should be exploring April 12 for a return to offices."" Another senior Tory backbencher said: ""My general view is that if the data stays good and improves then things should be accelerated. I don't take the view that people should be forced to go back to the office. I'd expect we'll have a much more hybrid arrangement. I think that people should be free to go back to the office."" Both Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, have recently indicated that they expect many people who have been working from home  . Working from home fatigue appears to be setting in, with a 20 percentage point rise in the number of people planning on returning to the office. A study by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that workers could return to offices faster than expected as a result of the success of the vaccine rollout. It found that in the three months to February 80 per cent of employees now wanted to head back once the pandemic is over, up from fewer than 60 per cent in the previous quarter. An RCS report said this change in perceptions may be attributed to ""the speed of  , with more people now seemingly expecting a faster return to normal life than previously anticipated"". Kath Fontana, the RICS president and a facilities management specialist, said: ""We've all recognised that workplaces will need to adapt as a result of Covid-19, but it's very revealing that this latest survey shows much more optimism on the return to the office. ""What we've seen is employers using this time to look forward to and plan ahead for what the 'new normal' will look like. Effective facilities management will be even more crucial as we build back from this pandemic – the positive sentiment expressed by our professionals on the ground in this survey is light at the end of this dark tunnel.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/28/boris-johnson-urged-consider-lifting-work-home-guidance-next/
181,,"School’s out … again! Cue fixed parental smiles that don’t quite reach our eyes. So great to have the kids at home. Isn’t it? Still, it gives everyone a nice break away from the outrage over cartoons and Afros and upskirting. There’s a sentence I thought I’d never write. But, then again, here’s a moral quagmire none of us thought we’d have to wade through. Forgive the air of ennui and sarcasm, but I am so very tired of feeling angry. And, make no mistake, I am furious. At all of it. When we desperately longed to get our offspring back into education, it was in the misty-eyed belief that they would be energised and eager to learn, not sexually assaulting their classmates and mounting demonstrations against the anti-black bias of the curriculum. Seriously, what the hell is going on in modern Britain? Now that the pupils are safely (and, arguably, safer) off the premises, it is surely time to take stock and learn some lessons about the appalling behaviour of children and head teachers alike. But first, let me say the heart-rending stories of primary school girls being groped and manhandled, secondary girls being bullied into giving blow jobs and all girls being humiliated with criminal disrespect, makes me want to line up every last nasty little scrote and give them a Relationship and Sex Education lesson that will make them cry and lie awake at night. Possibly forever. Yes, I do know it’s not all boys. Obviously not. But it’s a vanishingly rare boy who isn’t keenly aware of the toxic locker room sexism that is fostering an epidemic of rampant assault. It’s easy to blame the availability of stomach-churning porn. More difficult to convey that turning a blind eye is not an option. “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,” Edmund Burke famously wrote in 1770. Less famously he added: “When bad men combine, the good must associate, else they will fall, one by one.” I know now that I made the right decision to send my daughters to girls’ schools, where they can be good at physics, get sweaty playing sport and grow up away from the male gaze.  In my experience (and I attended a single-sex primary and grammar), we emerged with a sense of our own worth, not one predicated on whether the boys found us hot or a swot. We weren’t entirely immune but we were armed with enough confidence and self-esteem to question other people’s superficial value judgments. Gavin Williamson has launched his anonymous abuse hotline, and an investigation into  . I hope something useful and of practical application comes out of it. Incidentally, I’m uncomfortable with the term “rape culture”. It’s too extreme to get everyone behind efforts to tackle violence; I actually suspect it’s been adopted because it’s easier to spell than “misogyny”. Essentially, boys need to have one single message drummed into them. It is this: sexual assault isn’t about sex, it is about power. It is preying on the weak, the preserve of the inadequate and the cowardly. Nobody should want to be mates with a coward and a bully; it will tarnish them, too. Bullies and cowards come in all forms, however, as the Batley Grammar School protest has revealed. Even the headlines – “Probe into Prophet Muhammad Blasphemy Row” – gave me pause. I was born in Northern Ireland where religious rummies were par for the course, but getting exercised about the Prophet Mohammad on mainland Britain is a new one on me. who showed a cartoon to the class are appalling. He was suspended and is in hiding. This, despite the knee jerk grovelling response of the headmaster who apologised “unequivocally” for the caricature and assured the mob that the teacher had also “given their most sincere apologies”. A petition set up calling for the school to reinstate the teacher has garnered more than 70,000 signatures. He remains in fear of his life. How has it come to this? Freedom of speech is already under threat on university campuses, careers are being destroyed by social media activists. To watch a head teacher give in to the intolerance of a highly vocal militant Muslim minority shames us all. Climbdowns are never a good look, but sometimes they are necessary.   could have – should have – been avoided with a little common sense. Head teacher Daniel Smith prompted chaos after effectively banning hairstyles that “block the view of others” and insisting that hijabs must cover all the hair. For pity’s sake, battles over young people’s hair are always doomed. So why would anyone plant their flag on that particular hill? Especially when diktats can be construed as blatantly racist? Because, let’s face it, culturally sensitive they were not.  The uniform U-turn wasn’t much of a biggie – unlike Smith’s mealy-mouthed announcement that he would also be holding a review over flying the Union flag outside the school as it “evokes often intense reactions”. So what? It’s the national flag. For this nation. If anyone wants to react, intensively, that’s their business. As for the students’ online letter complaining that the “chronological history curriculum focus is on white British kings and queens”, I throw my hands up in exasperation. That’s chronology for you, kids. Have you considered reading around the subject? I’m sure I’ll be accused of “shutting down” the young. I’m not. I’m just trying to be heard in the cacophony of melodramatically hurt feelings and offence-taking. I hope in the next couple of weeks, the emotional temperature will cool down.

182,"Raise school starting age to seven, Scottish Lib Dems argue","Children in Scotland should start school at the age of seven rather than four or five, the Scottish Liberal Democrats have insisted in a “radical” new proposal. As the first full week of campaigning for the Holyrood elections began, party leader Willie Rennie said delaying the age children start school will help give youngsters a “flying start”. It comes as Nicola Sturgeon promised to   if the SNP is re-elected in May, despite failing to meet her previous pledge of closing the education attainment gap between rich and poor pupils.  Focusing on their plans for education, the Lib Dems hailed the plan as a ""historical, radical and positive change"" in Scotland's school system. They want youngsters to have a ""truly play-based education"" up to the age of seven - when more formal schooling would begin. The expanded early years education would be mandatory, they stressed, and would focus on areas such as child development, social skills and outdoor learning, as well as physical and mental health. Mr Rennie said: ""Scottish Liberal Democrats will introduce a truly play-based education until age seven, to give every child a flying start. ""By learning together through play, children develop the skills needed for trickier tasks and are better prepared to shine in areas like literacy and numeracy."" He continued: ""The UK is almost unique in Europe in expecting children as young as four or five to begin formal schooling. By the age of nine, pupils in Finland have much higher reading levels than pupils in the UK, having started at the age of seven."" Mr Rennie pledged his party would also ""immediately abolish the national testing of four- and five-year-olds introduced by the SNP and heavily criticised by teachers"". Speaking about the standardised assessments, he said that parliament voted to halt them “years ago” but was “ignored”.

Responding to the pledge, an SNP spokesperson said: ""We recognise that there is a debate to be had and agree 5 and 6 year olds should have 'play-based' education.  ""That’s what primaries do now and, given there is no consensus on increasing age, we do not currently support changing.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/29/raise-school-starting-age-seven-scottish-lib-dems-argue/
183,,"The “refreshed” Countryside Code issued by Natural England is certainly timely. Millions of people are expected to celebrate their partial escape from lockdown this Easter weekend by flocking to the country’s loveliest beauty spots – leaving a trail of litter in their wake. Perky, upbeat and with fewer of those pesky commandments to keep dogs on leads at all times and not light fires, the code even encourages visitors to “be nice, say hello, share the space” as well as “enjoy your visit, have fun, make a memory”. But is there not something a little  ? To this country-dweller at least, there is a distinct whiff of forelock-tugging rustics in the lofty exhortation to “say hello”, as though the whole of rural Britain were a gigantic Archers set where everyone is far friendlier and more welcoming than grumpy city folk. That’s true up to a point. When I first moved to London after an outdoorsy childhood in rural Warwickshire, I bounded on to the tube, greeting my fellow commuters with a cheery “Morning!” and a big smile. No response. Everyone looked horrified, retracted their heads into their collars like startled tortoises and hid behind their newspapers as though confronted by a dangerous loony. I soon learned to shun eye contact and cross the street to avoid importunate strangers. However,  . There are plenty of loners and weirdos, too – and stroppy landowners reminiscent of Viz’s Farmer Palmer with his age-old war cry: “Git Orf Moi Laarnd!” Any visitor bidding them good day having strayed even a few yards off the public footpath risks an earful of invective, if not a warning blast from a shotgun. Spotting a group of ramblers trespassing in a field where our tenant’s dressage horses were grazing, my husband suggested an Exocet strike as a deterrent. He wasn’t entirely joking. The code’s suggestion that dogs be “kept under control” seems far too mild and generalised. Our local farmers have been known to shoot much-loved pets whose owners have unwisely let them loose near fields of cattle or sheep. I have several times encountered distraught owners invariably claiming: “He was ever so friendly – he wouldn’t have hurt a fly.” Try telling that to a shepherd whose prize ewe has just miscarried thanks to the attentions of a “friendly” terrier. At least the code spells out the rules for dog mess: in the absence of public bins, take it home. But how many owners will actually carry out this unsavoury task? My daily jog through nearby woodland amid piles of McDonald’s wrappers and lager cans also involves dodging those little black plastic bags, left on the path, like votive offerings to Anubis. Most country people take a far harder line on littering than townies – even when they are outside their natural habitat. My abiding memory of the 1997 Countryside Rally was how the tweedy types automatically picked up their own and everyone else’s rubbish, leaving Hyde Park spotless and far cleaner than they had found it. So this Easter weekend, go ahead and make a memory. Just be sure it’s a good one.

184,,"Since the rise and fall of Donald Trump, it is common to attempt to smear one’s political opponents by suggesting they possess one or more of the attributes exhibited by the 44th president during his four tumultuous years in office. All colours of the political spectrum have attempted to co-opt Trump hatred for their own ends. The British Left try to convince others (and themselves) that Boris Johnson is our very own version of The Orange One. A far more convincing comparison is with Jeremy Corbyn, who upended the Labour Party in much the same way that Trump did the GOP, and put the extremists in control. There are even valid comparisons to be made between Trump and Nicola Sturgeon: her insistent demands for Scottish independence smack of the same nationalist exceptionalism that so lowered the esteem in which America was held by the rest of the world. The first minister might as well name her manifesto for the forthcoming Holyrood elections, “Make Scotland Great Again”. But you have to go further back in Trump’s career, to before he won the Republican nomination for president in 2016, to understand the special quality that Sturgeon and the former president share. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he told a receptive audience. He then went on to win the general election so he probably had a point. Trump was talking not about himself but about the loyalty of his supporters. A British example of such narcissistic political chutzpah might be, for example, if the leader of a devolved administration accepted large amounts of cash from central (UK) government that was aimed specifically at helping in the fight against covid and the pandemic, and then that politician using the cash instead to fund electoral bribes for the electorate. That would be outrageous, right? I mean, surely we haven’t gone so far down the Trumpian road where such behaviour would result in anything other than electoral humiliation and expulsion from office? Yet according to the independent think tank,  , that is exactly what Sturgeon is doing right now, in full view of the media and the public. What’s more, the consequence of this most cynical and dishonest political sleight-of-hand looks likely to be her re-election for another five-year term of office. The IFS have found that money sent northwards by the Treasury to help deal with covid will be used instead to fund free school meals for primary pupils and free bus travel for under-22-year-olds – key elements of the SNP’s manifesto. There may well be merit in these policies, but that’s not what the money was intended for. Like the rest of the country, Scotland is on its knees thanks to lockdown. Thanks to social distancing measures and travel restrictions, hospitals may have been able to weather the storm, but the rest of the economy has not fared as well.  The emergency funds supplied from the UK coffers are a vital and welcome benefit of being part of the United Kingdom, but they were always meant to be temporary fixes. If Sturgeon and the SNP use that cash to fund permanent, long-term policies, funding will have to be found from elsewhere in the Scottish budget before long (but fortunately only after the polling places have closed). Far more importantly, that money needs to be spent on ameliorating the immediate threat covid, not on anything else. Even the “generous” (not a term the health unions would use) four per cent raise for NHS staff that Sturgeon announced at the start of her re-election campaign could be partly funded from the Treasury’s covid money, according to the IFS. Scots should be outraged at this irresponsible deceit, but polls suggest they’re not too bothered. Perhaps they will be more moved by the IFS’s other major finding – that, thanks to the  , used by the Treasury to calculate the block grant to the nations and regions of the UK, Scotland receives £1.30 for every pound spent in England. This gets to the heart of what devolution is supposed to be about. Too often it is painted as no more than a division of “reserved” and “devolved” powers. It is that, of course, but more importantly it is a mechanism by which any part of the UK which needs financial support can get it through the pooling and sharing of national resources. It is this mechanism which the SNP wish to surrender. So a nationalist government that wants to end the subsidy paid to it by the rest of the UK is, in the meantime, using that same subsidy – plus the extra cash intended to fight covid – to fund electoral bribes in an attempt to persuade Scots to vote for independence and, therefore, a permanent end to high spending on services. As an outline for a political satire it requires some work. As an homage to the politician who boasted that however badly he behaved he would always remain popular, it is fascinatingly and depressingly accurate.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/arent-scots-outraged-sturgeons-irresponsible-use-emergency-funds/
185,"Jennifer Arcuri pursuing 'vendetta', say friends of Boris Johnson after latest affair claims","Jennifer Arcuri is pursuing a “vendetta” against Boris Johnson, friends of the Prime Minister alleged on Monday night, as Downing Street insisted he had done nothing wrong. Mr Johnson’s   has resurfaced after she gave a series of embarrassing interviews to a tabloid newspaper, including revealing details of text messages and even releasing a ‘selfie’ photograph taken in his kitchen. Ms Arcuri, 36, claimed she had sex with Mr Johnson, then London’s mayor, on the sofa of the family home he shared with his now   in March 2016. Ms Arcuri also claims she sent him a topless photograph, which prompted Mr Johnson to reply in a text message that it was “enough to make a bishop kick through a stained-glass window”. The affair, which began in 2012 and ended in 2016, is currently subject to an investigation by the Greater London Assembly’s oversight committee over Mr Johnson’s failure to declare the relationship. Ms Arcuri, an American entrepreneur living in London at the time, was granted access to trade mission events and received funding from London & Partners, a company funded in part by the London mayor’s office to promote the city. However, on Monday night friends of Mr Johnson questioned Ms Arcuri’s motives in telling her story to the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror four years after their affair ended. It is understood she has received a sizeable sum for an old-fashioned “kiss and tell”. An ally of the Prime Minister said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Boris is guilty of a monumental lapse in taste. At what point is the hawking of a story that is three years old cease to be news and start to look like a vendetta.” Another friend suggested the relationship was only sporadic during those four years because Mr Johnson was “too busy” to have a sustained affair while still married and working as London’s mayor.  The friend questioned Ms Arcuri’s motive in taking the ‘selfie’ in the kitchen and then keeping it, along with text messages, for years afterwards. The friend said: “Is it really credible that Boris was rushing off for an afternoon bonk with this woman for four years? It seems incredible. I don’t think it could be on the scale she is claiming. “His aides knew where he was more or less the whole time. She [Arcuri] has obviously thought how she can maximise this for her own gain. You can’t blame her, but she has saved that photo and texts for years and then just waited.” The prospect of an inquiry could push Mr Johnson into the embarrassing position of having to defend his affair at a public hearing. The Telegraph understands that the London Assembly committee will write to him, probably after the mayoral elections in May, asking why he did not declare his relationship, confidentially at least, which would have allowed him to could keep the matter secret from his wife and family. If the committee is unhappy with his written responses, it could demand that he gives evidence in public. Sources said Ms Arcuri’s latest claims, made in the newspapers, were sufficient to trigger a new stage in the investigation. Len Duvall, the chair of the oversight committee, said in a statement: ""Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position. It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said in 2020 that there would not be a criminal inquiry into whether “Mr Johnson used his position while Mayor of London to benefit and reward American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri”. The IOPC said there was no evidence that Mr Johnson had “influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri” or that he had “influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions”. But the IOPC said that under the broader  , “it would have been wise for Mr Johnson to have declared this as a conflict of interest, and a failure to do so could have constituted a breach of these broader principles”. Asked whether the Prime Minister would assist the GLA inquiry, his press secretary Allegra Stratton said: “He will engage, but this was already being looked at in detail by no less an authority than the Independent Office for Police Conduct. ""It found that these claims were untrue and unfounded. This was looked at in depth and it was found there was no case to answer. “The Prime Minister follows the Nolan Principles in conducting himself in public life.” Ms Stratton refused to say if he would give evidence in person if requested. She added: ""The work has been done, public time and money and effort has been spent looking into whether there has been any wrongdoing, and it was found that the Prime Minister, the then-London mayor, has no case to answer.""   Another friend of Mr Johnson’s added: “Given all the stuff that was written before at a moment of heightened political interest ... you would have thought they would have been able to make it stick before. Does the general public really give a toss? It’s not as though he’s ever tried to be whiter than white.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/29/jennifer-arcuri-pursuing-vendetta-say-friends-boris-johnson/

His dubious talents were fully on display today when he was interviewed by Mishal Hussein on the Today Programme about his attempted return to front line politics after spending years fighting to save his personal reputation. And it’s clear he’s now back to being the slick snake-oil salesman we remember from when he was losing referendums and making a fool himself on Vladimir Putin’s favourite television channel. It was, in my opinion, a pretty shameless but entirely typical performance but one we will have to get used to in the next five weeks as he pitches himself as the leader we’ve always wanted. Assisting him in what he sees as his glorious mission will be his army of adherents -  who will be ditched just as soon as they give Salmond some kind of presence at Holyrood; a presence, moreover, that he hopes will give him leverage, or even power, over Sturgeon. Astonishingly, to my mind, a majority of his candidates are women. For now the 32 seem mesmerised by this failed politician who’s using most of them, not on the basis of any abilities they may have, but purely to make up the numbers necessary to field four candidates in each of Scotland’s eight regions. He says he’ll win 32 seats but will happily make do with less so long as it’s enough seats to prevent Sturgeon winning an outright majority. That way he could hold the balance of power at Holyrood and would seek to bend her to his will if she wants another referendum. But long before we get to that phase, what this nationalist messiah is bent on doing through sheer denial and bluster is not so much living down his admission of ‘inappropriate’ behaviour towards women as insisting there’s nothing to live down. At his trial last year he had said the allegations against him had been “part exaggeration, part fabrication” and repeatedly insisted that “fair minded people” would accept the verdict of that jury. This was the description he returned to again and again. Pressed continuously by Ms Hussein about his record in relation to women he replied: ‘ … the most significant thing is the verdict of the jury, and I say fair minded people, you know, think that's very important.’ On the contrary, and from this vantage point, I would hope that most ‘fair minded people’ would steer well clear of Alex Salmond in this election - especially women. Sadly, however, there are many in the nationalist camp who prefer him to Sturgeon and will vote for Salmond and Alba. I know it seems incredible but I fear it’s likely to happen in this strange election. I’ve always thought nationalists preached a phoney prescription for Scotland’s ills.

On Wednesday, the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities  , which concluded that Britain is no longer a place ""where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities"". The landmark 250-page report   from Labour MPs, charities and academics, who accused the Government of ""keeping us debating about the existence of racism rather than doing anything about it"".  It has since emerged that a number of individuals thanked for their input have claimed they were unaware that they were contributing to the final report.  The revelation came as   and Doreen Lawrence, who campaigned for 18 years for justice after her son Stephen was murdered by racists, described the report as ""giving racists the green light"". On Friday, Mr Johnson conceded that more work was needed to tackle ""very serious issues"" of racism in Britain. He thanked Mr Kasumu for his ""great"" work, including on encouraging hesitant communities to take up the offer of a Covid vaccine. The departure of Mr Kasumu was ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the report, Downing Street insisted. Mr Johnson said of the report: ""I don't say the Government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider. There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address."" Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, is among the 36 individuals listed in the report as ""Appendix D: Stakeholders"" who the commission ""heard evidence from"" during its work, and for which ""it would like to thank the following for their participation"". Sir John is quoted in the report as endorsing the commission's recommendation for establishing an Office for Health Disparities. It is understood that he emailed his comments to the commission.  However, after seeing his name on the list he told The Telegraph: ""Totally news to me. I never spoke to them ... I did support this office and had a call with them, but that is not the report – it is different.""  Sara Rowbotham, a Labour councillor in Rochdale, also said she was ""a bit shocked"" to see her name on the list, adding that she had only spoken about a new chatbot product to assist children who have been sexually exploited to get better access to support services.  Ms Rowbotham, known for her role in helping to expose the child sex abuse ring in Greater Manchester, added: ""My involvement had nothing to do with whether institutional racism still exists or not."" She said it was ""a bit cheeky"" for the commission to include her name on the list. S.I. Martin, who founded 500 Years of Black London walks, was ""horrified"" to discover his name on the list of stakeholders and said: ""Thursday morning was the first I knew of being one of a number of participants thanked as a stakeholder of this review – which I am root and branch opposed to. ""Initially I felt hilarity at this stupid, cruel and boring level of discource and immorality – but then it morphed into concern that if my name was continually associated with this report, those who don't know me would imagine that I might have some sort of association with it.  ""The word 'whitewash' has been over-used, but the report is a direct insult and attack on minority communities who are working against institutionalised racist behaviour which is a fact of life for large swathes of the population. People are not making this up."" Stephen Bourne, a social historian specialising in black heritage who was also on the stakeholder list, tweeted: ""To my horror I [am] named as one of the 'academics & individuals' who was consulted by the Commission on Race & Ethnic Disparities. I wonder how many others were consulted without their knowledge?"" A spokesman for the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said: ""The commission engaged both directly and indirectly with thousands of researchers, analysts, stakeholders and members of the public to inform this comprehensive report.

188,Carrie Symonds' charity: inquiry into 'mismanagement' could question trustee Lord Goldsmith,"An investigation into potential financial mismanagement at Carrie Symonds’ wildlife charity could involve her close friend and government minister Lord Goldsmith being questioned over his role as a trustee. The Charity Commission   into the Aspinall Foundation to examine possible conflicts of interest among trustees and possible misuse of charitable resources.  Lord Goldsmith resigned as a trustee in August 2019, but the two years he spent in the position coincide with part of the period being closely examined by the commission. Any such move to question him could prove embarrassing for Lord Goldsmith, who became Environment Minister under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Ms Symonds' partner, a month before resigning as a trustee. Ms Symonds, the Conservative Party’s former head of communications,  , and is therefore unlikely to be questioned by the Charity Commission about her role. A commission source said: “The concerns we have long pre-date her appointment to the charity.” The commission opened a pre-inquiry regulatory compliance case into the charity in November, two months before Ms Symonds' appointment. It has now decided to escalate its involvement to identify any possible misconduct, mismanagement or risk to the Aspinall Foundation, which works to return captive wild animals to their native habitat, after identifying “further questions regarding the charity’s governance”. These include the administration, governance and management of the charity by its trustees “with specific regard to how conflicts of interest have been dealt with” and “whether or not there has been any unauthorised trustee benefit; and whether or not the trustees have complied with and fulfilled their duties and responsibilities under charity law”. The foundation, chaired by  , the casino owner and socialite, has been dogged by a number of serious questions over the conduct of its financial affairs. Its last set of accounts, to the end of December 2019, show that the 30-room Palladian grade II-listed Howletts mansion it owns in Kent was rented to Mr Aspinall for £2,500 a month. At the end of its last financial year, Mr Aspinall owed the foundation £113,122. According to its accounts his debt to the charity in 2018 was £88,783; in 2017 it was £58,783; in 2016 the figure £28,484. In 2015, Mr Aspinall owed £19,208 and in 2014, £47,655.  The charity has not explained the sums or whether Mr Aspinall was charged interest. During 2019, the foundation paid Mr Aspinall’s wife, Victoria, £12,500 for interior design services, on top of £50,000 paid to her the previous year. It also paid a firm called Alvarium £64,000 for accounting services in 2019. A current foundation trustee, Charles Filmer, is a director of Alvarium. The Telegraph understands Lord Goldsmith could be questioned by commission officials over why such payments were made during the period he was a trustee. A spokesperson for the Charity Commission said: “We cannot speculate on the conduct of any specific inquiry, and while an inquiry is ongoing, we do not offer comment on its handling or progress. It is open to any inquiry of the Commission to examine the actions of past trustees, as well as those currently serving a charity.” Although not questioned under oath, trustees and other individuals interviewed by the commission are “legally compelled to provide the information requested or attend a meeting as required”. The commission stresses that while the opening of an inquiry is not a finding of wrongdoing, a statutory inquiry is its most serious form of investigation, undertaken only where it is seriously concerned that a charity is at risk of wrongdoing and abuse. Neither Lord Goldsmith nor the Aspinall Foundation responded to requests for comment.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/01/carrie-symondss-friend-lord-goldsmith-could-face-questions-charity/

190,"Alex Salmond's new Alba Party will not win a single Holyrood seat, poll suggests","Alex Salmond's hopes of staging a political comeback in the Holyrood election suffered a major blow last night after a poll suggested his new Alba Party will not win a single seat. Mr Salmond has claimed the party, launched last Friday, could form a pro-independence ""super-majority"" with the SNP after May's Holyrood election but the survey found only three per cent of Scots plan to vote for it. Prof Sir John Curtice, Britain's most eminent psephologist, said the findings indicated that at best Mr Salmond may ""just"" get a seat in the North East of Scotland but none of the other Alba candidates would win election. The Survation poll for DC Thomson also said that 71 per cent of Scots view Mr Salmond unfavourably, by far the worst rating for any mainstream UK political leader.  In comparison, Boris Johnson was viewed unfavourably by 56 per cent of Scots, while 50 per cent had a favourable view of Nicola Sturgeon. More than half of those polled also held the view that Mr Salmond was “hindering the cause for Scottish independence”, compared with only 17 per cent who said his contribution was helping it. In another major boost for Ms Sturgeon, the poll indicated the SNP is on course to win a narrow majority in the May 6 Holyrood election despite her being embroiled for months in the scandal around her government's unlawful investigation of allegations against Mr Salmond. The results were published after Mr Salmond declined to show contrition for his inappropriate past conduct towards women and insisted that the Scottish public was prepared to accept his acquittal on sex assault charges and “move on”. Sir John told the Dundee Courier: “The headline is that it looks as though it’s all over for Salmond, though he might just get a seat in the north-east himself. “But this is not what he needs if he is going to get his campaign to take off."" He said that similarly low support in other polls would be the death knell to Mr Salmond's hopes of being included in any live TV debates. The results put the SNP ahead in both constituency and list votes, on 49 per cent and 37 per cent  respectively, while the Tories were on 21 per cent and 18 per cen. Support for Labour was 20 per cent and 19 per cent, for the Liberal Democrats on nine per cent and eight per cent, the Greens on 11 per cent in the list and the Alba Party trailing three per cent The figures translate to a narrow majority for the SNP on 66 MSPs out of 129, with Labour in second on 24, Tories on 21, Greens on 11 and Lib Dems on seven. An Alba Party spokesman said: ""After only three days since the launch of Scotland’s fastest growing party Alba’s scores are on the board.  “These early indications put Alba within touching distance of representation across Scotland. With five weeks still to go Alba’s support can only grow as we approach polling day.""",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/alex-salmonds-new-alba-party-will-not-win-single-holyrood-seat/
191,Sturgeon 'categorically' rules out working with Salmond in major blow to his 'supermajority' plan,"Nicola Sturgeon has “categorically” ruled out working with Alex Salmond if he is elected to Holyrood, and he suffered a second blow after a poll showed his bid to return to politics is  The First Minister said on Thursday that she would not cooperate with her former mentor if he wins seats at May's election, undermining his claim that he can secure an independence “supermajority” that would help her secure a new referendum.  The intervention is likely to see a bitter rift between the pair, and a civil war within the wider independence movement, deepen further.  Meanwhile, the first poll conducted since Mr Salmond launched his new Alba Party found support at just three per cent - well below the threshold needed to win a single seat. Ms Sturgeon had previously  to working with Mr Salmond and his new Alba party, after he launched a sensational bid to return to frontline politics last week.  However, she toughened her stance, telling Channel 4 News that she was giving a ""categorical"" pledge that she would not work with a man she has recently described as a ""conspiracy theorist"".  She said: “I won’t be seeking to work with Alex Salmond. I don’t think his new party will help the independence cause, I’m not even sure from his perspective it’s intended to do that. “I have no intentions of trying to work with Alex Salmond or a new party.” Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond have not spoken since mid-2018, when they fell out spectacularly over the Scottish Government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him. Mr Salmond would go on to accuse Ms Sturgeon’s husband, the SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, of conspiring to have him jailed, while Ms Sturgeon has questioned his fitness for public office. Mr Murrell has always denied claims he plotted against Mr Salmond.  In a separate interview earlier this week, Ms Sturgeon would not rule out relying on backing from Alba MSPs to claim a mandate for another independence referendum. She had also suggested that Mr Salmond acknowledging inappropriate conduct towards women, which he admitted in a trial which saw him cleared of criminality, was a necessary “first step” to reestablishing a relationship with him.  While Mr Salmond has previously claimed that while he would not “forgive” Ms Sturgeon over their feud, they could put their differences aside to campaign for independence. However, asked on Thursday whether she would give a ""categorical"" assurance not to work with Mr Salmond, she replied: ""I think I just did"". Mr Salmond has urged voters to back Ms Sturgeon’s SNP with their first vote, used to elect constituency MSPs under the Holyrood voting system, and his Alba Party with their second vote, used to elect regional representatives. However, Ms Sturgeon claimed this amounted to an attempt to “game” Holyrood’s electoral system, which sees regional seats allocated under a process designed to deliver a more proportional result.  She accused Mr Salmond of attempting to ""mislead"" voters by suggesting the country could “trick our way to independence.” At his own press conference yesterday afternoon, Mr Salmond revealed he would be writing to broadcasters to demand inclusion in TV election debates which would mean a live face-to-face showdown with his former protege.  He also launched an attack on Ms Sturgeon’s independence strategy, suggesting she had been wrong to set out her preferred method and timeframe for securing a new vote on leaving the UK. He also claimed the First Minister should “take direction” from a Scottish Parliament he is hoping to reenter, rather than deciding on her tactics by herself. “I don't think you should tell in advance, your negotiating opponent, what exactly you're going to do and the timescale you intend to do it on,” he said.  “Pigeonholing yourself into one route in one timescale, I think has a limitations over the advantages of taking the substantial independence supermajority in the Parliament, and taking direction from that.” Meanwhile, uncertainty has also arison over Mr Salmond’s stance on full EU membership, which Ms Sturgeon enthusiastically supports.  Kenny MacAskill, the former SNP justice secretary and Alba candidate, yesterday backed EEA or EFTA membership for an independent Scotland before “an eventual referendum” on rejoining the EU.  Mr Salmond said his party’s position would be decided at a candidates’ conference on Saturday, but did not commit to backing full EU membership. He said his party would adopt a “very friendly” attitude to its “friends and colleagues across the European continent”. Mr Salmond unveiled a slate of 32 candidates on Wednesday, and has claimed upwards of 90 of 129 MSPs could support independence after the election if his “supermajority” plan is a success. He will today unveil the number of members who have signed up to his Alba Party since its launch last week, in an effort to add weight to his push for inclusion in upcoming TV debates with other party leaders. He said that in the first BBC debate on Monday, he was mentioned several times with no right of reply, while including Alba as a sixth party would offer a balance between unionist and pro-independence speakers.  A spokesman for the BBC said it would be “looking, as we always do at this stage in an election campaign, at our future plans for coverage.” STV said it would soon be announcing “comprehensive” election coverage which would be  “in line with Ofcom guidance”.  ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/sturgeon-categorically-rules-working-salmond-major-blow-supermajority/
192,,"Early on in lockdown, No 10 officials began to notice something suspicious. Keir Starmer would start to call for minor changes in policy – which just happened to coincide with what ministers had already decided to do. If they agreed something on a Monday and planned to announce it on a Friday, Starmer would pop up to demand it on a Wednesday. He seemed to have an inside source, which is not unusual. But what was strange was to see how Starmer defines the job of Opposition. Rather than expose flaws in Government thinking, Starmer has behaved like a Tory superfan – trying to work out where Boris Johnson will go next, then rushing to get there before anyone else. On the big issues, he has been more factotum than foe. Does the Prime Minister want to   Even when there is no longer an emergency? Very good, sir. Count on my vote. Problems with rebellious Tory backbenchers? Don’t worry, Labour MPs are right behind you. If Starmer really were opposed to vaccine identity cards – or “passports”, to adopt the official euphemism – he could vote them down. There are enough Tory rebels to defeat the Government on this. But after telling this newspaper   his aides then rushed to explain that this didn’t mean he actually opposes them. His official position is that at some point, months down the road, when all adults have been vaccinated, health identity cards might seem like overkill. Now, as before, Starmer is placing his bets on what the Tories will end up doing. Now, as before, he’s probably right. Ministers are concerned about young people not getting the vaccine, given that they face a relatively low risk from the virus. So the idea is to sell vaccines as a “passport” to freedom. The new (unofficial) message will be that being vaccinated is not so much about the virus but whether you’d like to meet friends. Go on holiday. Watch a football match. Big events may soon be laid on exclusively for the vaccinated and Covid-secure, to reinforce this point. Even if this dystopia never comes to pass – would we really want to restrict access to basic liberty to those with a certain immunity status? – the controversy is useful for the Government. It associates the vaccine with freedom, which, ministers think, will encourage uptake. Michael Gove’s “consultation” on the digital identity cards is, now, no such thing. Officials working on the project have been told “the Prime Minister wants vaccine passports to happen” and that the debate is over. In his private Zoom calls with MPs, Gove talks like a man whose mind is made up. “He’s just scouting to find out arguments against, so he can defeat them,” says one he spoke to recently. Gove is also in charge of a review into the future of social distancing. Backbenchers who have asked about that have been told it’s the same as his “consultation” for vaccine passports. This is significant: it suggests that social-distancing diktats could stay for offices and pubs, to incentivise (or menace) employers or landlords who don’t want to ask colleagues and customers for their vaccine identity card. All this stems from : that, if you want people to do something, carrots and sticks will work better than legislation. You can reward good behaviour – or make life a little harder for the non-compliant. There’s no question of coercion. People are free: to choose the easy way or the hard way. It gets uglier if you think about where all this might lead and who might be excluded if vaccine passports are demanded for pubs and restaurants. The racial disparity remains huge. Among the over-60s, only 6 per cent of white people have not been vaccinated – but this is true for 34 per cent of black Brits. It’s not quite clear why there’s such a large gap, or how likely it is to narrow. But unless it does, vaccine passports would mean a disproportionate number of white faces in any establishment. Politically, and ethically, it is – to put it mildly – problematic. Voting without identity cards is allowed to protect an important principle: that citizens without photo-ID have as much right to civic life as those who do. Several million people, often with troubled lives, fall into this category. Any identity card scheme would be popular with the wealthy and the established if it speeds up the restoration of old privileges. But such a scheme would exclude from much of society an important chunk of the population to whom compassionate Conservatism is supposedly dedicated. Once, Labour was too. Vaccine passports are impractical until everyone has had the offer, which takes us to late July. Or, if it’s a second-dose requirement, much later. By which time Gove may announce that, because so many have been vaccinated, they won’t be needed for everyday life. This is certainly how many in Government imagine things will go: that the implications of segregating society along the lines of Covid status are too grim for it to actually happen. Starmer seems to be betting on this outcome too. Yet again, he’s calling for what he thinks the Tories will do. It’s all quite depressing. Starmer might think he’s rising above party political games but he does no one a service by refusing to scrutinise Government ideas or look at the bigger picture. He might ask whether lockdowns work (a recent study uses Britain as an example on why they don’t). He might ask whether Imperial College’s influential work on Covid is so addled with pro-lockdown bias that an investigation is needed (as a Stanford professor recently said). Such claims may stand or fall – but the point of Parliament is to debate and scrutinise. Decisions made now will shape society for years, perhaps decades to come. It’s hard to think of a time when there has been a greater need for rigorous Opposition. Tony Blair spoke of “triangulation” between Left and Right. Starmer’s triangulation seems to be between what the Tories are doing now and what he thinks they’ll do next. This doesn’t position him as having good judgment or a clear set of principles. Judging by the opinion polls, voters are beginning to notice.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/keir-starmer-acting-like-tory-superfan-robbing-britain-real/

194,Exclusive: Covid passport trials to begin at UK events within weeks," are set to be trialled at events in Britain within weeks, The Telegraph can reveal, as the Government pushes ahead with the idea despite a growing rebellion by MPs. New details of around a dozen pilot schemes for   will be announced in the coming days, with plans to trial Covid certification checks. The FA Cup final, an FA Cup semi-final, the League Cup final and the World Snooker Championship are taking part, with the Brit Awards also in discussions. People going to the events will be asked to take a Covid test to gain entry and another after attendance so that any spreading of the virus can be monitored. Government scientists are closely involved in designing the pilots and will watch everything from crowd flows to ventilation systems to learn lessons about running large events. Multiple government sources involved in the planning told The Telegraph it was hoped that Covid passports – producing   – will feature in some pilots. The events will run throughout April and May, and ministers want enough conclusions to be drawn for the reopening of large events to be able to happen from as early as mid-June. While events in April will require a negative Covid test to gain entry, it is hoped some of the pilots in May can trial an updated   which shows whether someone has had a jab, negative test or antibodies – what has been described a Covid passport. The announcement will be another indication that the Government is pushing ahead with possibly allowing people to  , even with no final decisions taken. However, a backlash is brewing in the Commons, with more than 70 MPs putting their names to a statement opposing the idea. They include around 40 Tories – a figure that will alarm Conservative whips, given the government majority in the Commons of roughly 80 seats – as well as around 20 Labour MPs and 10 Lib Dem MPs. The statement they backed said: ""We oppose the divisive and discriminatory use of Covid status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs."" The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, the ex-shadow chancellor, have also signed. The move comes after Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader,   he thought the ""British instinct"" would be against Covid passports once the pandemic eases. Sir Keir said there were no easy answers and he would only decide whether to oppose once detailed proposals had been published. On Thursday, Boris Johnson repeated   if they allowed for checks on jabs, negative tests and antibodies. Mr Johnson said it could help ""give maximum confidence to business and to customers here in the UK"", adding: ""Those three things working together will be useful for us as we go forward."" Using pilots for some large events   was announced in February, but new details of which events are involved and how it will work are expected within days. The Telegraph has learned that the organisers of the Brit Awards, the music awards show that takes place on May 11, are in talks about being involved, which would mean the return of an in-person audience. Talks are ongoing as all stakeholders are being consulted, and it is touch and go whether it will be included in the first pilots. A spokesman for The Brit Awards confirmed the interest, saying that ""we hope this year's show can be part of the pilot scheme"", but stressing that no final decision had been taken. The pilots will monitor all aspects of the safe reopening of large events including the use of Covid tests,   and – when the NHS app is ready for trials – Covid passports. The FA Cup semi-final between Leicester and Southampton, the League Cup final between Manchester City and Tottenham and the FA Cup final, all at Wembley Stadium, will be involved in the pilot scheme. Brent Council, the London authority covering Wembley, wrote to residents this week asking them to register interest in attending those first two games. The council said each attendee has to return a negative lateral flow Covid test 24 hours before the game and show proof to gain entry, plus take a PCR test at home afterwards. A government source stressed there was still time for changes to the pilot plan to be made before announcements from Mr Johnson on Monday.",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/exclusivecovid-passport-trials-begin-uk-events-month/
195,Alex Salmond demands TV showdown with Nicola Sturgeon before May elections,"Alex Salmond has launched a bid to secure a live TV showdown with Nicola Sturgeon, after he claimed sex assault claims against him were “part fabrication, part exaggeration”. The former First Minister, who is seeking to secure a pro-independence “super-majority” at May’s Holyrood elections  , is to write to the BBC and Scottish broadcaster STV on Friday, to demand a podium in upcoming debates with other party leaders. However, he faced criticism on Thursday after he repeatedly declined to show contrition for his inappropriate past conduct towards women, insisting that the Scottish public was prepared to accept his acquittal on sex assault charges last year and “move on”. Mr Salmond denied that his own lawyer had   and repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether his past behaviour towards women had been inappropriate, when pushed by the BBC’s Mishal Hussein on Radio 4’s  programme on Thursday. While Mr Salmond was   at a trial last year, he did admit some inappropriate conduct with female staffers, which his lawyer successfully argued was not criminal. He said the allegations against him had been “part exaggeration, part fabrication” and repeatedly insisted that “fair minded people” would accept the verdict. During his trial, he was accused of stroking a woman’s face in a car after she fell asleep during a foreign trip. On the witness stand, she claimed she felt “shocked” and “pretty icky” when she woke up to find the then-First Minster stroking her face. Mr Salmond acknowledged touching her face, but said he had done so to wake her up “in a gentle not abrupt way”. Asked about whether stroking a woman’s face while they were sleeping was appropriate by Ms Hussein, Mr Salmond said: “What I reflected on, the most significant thing is the verdict of the jury, and I say fair minded people, you know, think that's very important.” The presenter also referenced Mr Salmond’s own description of an alleged incident with a female staffer at his official Bute House residence, when he described the encounter as a   on a bed that lasted a few seconds. Mr Salmond was also challenged over alleged comments made by his lawyer, Gordon Jackson, on a train during Mr Salmond’s trial. A recording of Mr Jackson’s conversation was passed to The Sunday Times. Mr Jackson referred to his client as a “sex pest” and a “objectionable bully”, the newspaper reported. He was recorded saying: “This is hardly sexual… inappropriate, arsehole, stupid… but sexual?” Asked about the “sex pest” claim, Mr Salmond said that Mr Jackson had released a statement denying the remarks. Mr Jackson later claimed he had been the victim of a “ deliberate set up” but quit as the dean of the Faculty of Advocates following the controversy. Mr Salmond said: “Can I just point out that it’s very important that you don't repeat things which are just simply not true. “Gordon Jackson was my counsel, he said no such thing and released a statement indicating that. The BBC shouldn't really repeat things that they've read in the papers and things like that.” Ms Hessein said: “Sorry, there’s footage of him speaking on a train where he described you as a bully and a sex pest.”  Mr Salmond said: “I'm sorry, the footage doesn't show that and Gordon Jackson, who's an eminent counsel and was Dean of the Faculty of Advocates released a statement. I think we should really take the statement of somebody who was a former Faculty of Advocates dean.” He later added: ""Everything I've said at the trial stands and everything I've said previously stands, but what we're doing now is putting forward a case in the election. And for most people in Scotland, they think that these matters have been dealt with. ""My behaviour was tested as probably no behaviour has been tested before, in a trial of my peers in the High Court of judiciary in Scotland, the verdict’s in, the jury has decided and most fair minded people think that's fair enough. I go forward with the Alba party with this extraordinary list of candidates to put forward the case of independence for our country. ""Scotland, I'm certain, wants to move on from this and start talking about politics."" Mr Salmond also claimed that Nicola Sturgeon would work with him if he is elected to Holyrood, despite their extraordinary row over previous years, claiming “the cause of independence is much bigger than personalities”. However, in her own radio interview on Thursday morning, the First Minister suggested Mr Salmond was attempting to mislead voters with his new venture. Mr Salmond’s strategy is centred around persuading independence supporters to support the SNP with their first ballot, used to elect a constituency MSP, and his Alba party with their second vote, used to elect regional representatives from party lists. Under the Scottish Parliament system, parties that do well on constituencies find it far harder to win representation in regions, as regional seats are allocated under a system designed to make the overall result more proportional. Mr Salmond has claimed this means second votes for the SNP are ""wasted"" and that if large numbers of pro-independence voters back two separate parties, as many as 70 per cent of Holyrood seats could be held by MSPs who support the break up of Britain. Ms Sturgeon said: ""You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now.  ""What he said then – and he was right then – is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government. ""Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election.  ""And anybody who tries to suggest that there's a shortcut [to independence], or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence frankly is misleading people. ""It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate, but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well."" Asked about her comments that Mr Salmond is a ""gambler"", she added: “Everybody knew Alex Salmond was a gambler because he has never made any secret of it. He backs the horses on an almost daily basis.” ",Politics,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/salmond-sidesteps-questions-conduct-towards-women-insists-scotland/

I was on the road to recovery and was hoping to make a comeback on hallowed ground: the courts where Mr. Federer had trained in Switzerland on his way to winning 20 majors and becoming one of the planet’s most beloved athletes. .I’ve been a fan for more than 15 years, but my admiration reached new levels in 2017 when Mr. Federer won two majors at 35 after nearly every tennis writer had already written his tennis obituary. He could have quietly drifted off to the Alps to meditate while counting his Swiss francs, but instead he rededicated himself to the sport and turned the tables on his younger rivals. .A knee injury forced Mr. Federer to take more than a year off the ATP Tour. But he returned to competition in Doha, Qatar, a few weeks ago, where he won one match and lost another. It wasn’t a dream return but it was a promising start, and I’m relieved that he appears to be healthy and motivated. Like all fans, I’m hopeful he will have more trophies to hoist — perhaps this summer at Wimbledon or at the Olympic Games. .But I also live with the fear that he might retire soon, and so I felt a sense of urgency to make this journey before it was too late to see him play in person. .Little did I know back in October 2019 that my trip to Switzerland would be the last border I’d be crossing for a long time because of travel restrictions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The fact that I was able to walk in Mr. Federer’s footsteps, and sit in a packed arena with 10,000 unmasked fans and watch him play feels like a dream to me now. .But as I prepared for my trip, I found myself having to reassure Swiss sources I wanted to meet that I wasn’t a crazed stalker who planned to rifle through Mr. Federer’s trash cans. I assured them that I’m just a normal guy who admires his graceful strokes, his sportsmanship and his willingness to shed tears on the court. I reckoned that traveling across seven cantons to the places where Mr. Federer has lived and played tennis before watching him at the Swiss Indoors in Basel, his hometown tennis tournament, would help me understand not just the man but also Switzerland, that prosperous, heartbreakingly beautiful but enigmatic, four-language outlier in the heart of Europe. .I contemplated my journey standing on a hilltop looking down at  ., with its twin-spired, Baroque-style church and horses and mooing cows dotting the lush, green hills, before being welcomed by Abbot Federer, who greeted me like an old friend. “You know, before Roger became famous, I always used to have to spell my name,” he told me. “But now everyone knows the name Federer.” .Abbot Federer said his branch of the family tree intersected with Mr. Federer’s in the 16th century, but he said that he didn’t discuss their shared ancestry or Mr. Federer’s attendance at Mass (none of his business, he said) with the Swiss star when he visited the abbey. Abbot Federer said the Swiss aren’t comfortable with hero worship. “Roger would be equivalent to something like the royal family in the U.K., but here in Switzerland, we’ve never had a super-famous star, so we don’t know how to treat him because we don’t revere people here,” he said. .He was right — I had brought a Roger Federer hat with me, but stopped wearing it after realizing that no one else was wearing one. Just before he ducked into the cathedral to pray, Abbot Federer told me, “I really hope  . doesn’t win any more titles. I don’t want him to catch Roger.” .Abbot Federer also happened to be a relative of Antonia Federer, the wife of Jakob Federer, a vintner and consultant who invited me for lunch at their home in Berneck, a pretty country town of some 4,000 people near the Austrian border where the Federer clan originated. The German word feder, Jakob explained, means feather or quill, and in the Middle Ages, Federers were scribes. There are about 100 Federers in the village and it’s a common name in the cemetery where Roger Federer’s grandmother is buried behind the town’s ancient Catholic church. .Jakob Federer is the vice president of Berneck and he lives just a few doors from the medieval home where Roger’s father, Robert, was raised. He explained that there was a schism in the Federer clan after a fire ravaged Berneck in 1848; one branch of the family was blamed and were expelled. .We visited a wine cellar,  ., where Jakob ages his  . brand wine in giant oak barrels. After a vegetarian lunch, the village president, Bruno Seelos, stopped by for a chat. Mr. Seelos explained that the village planned to name something after Roger Federer, but they were waiting until he retired. Jakob and Antonia weren’t convinced this was necessary. “It’s like a cult of personality,” she said. .By the third day of my pilgrimage, I was itching to see if I was fit enough to return to tennis. Using intel I picked up from René Stauffer’s  . and my own research, I identified nearly a dozen tennis clubs around the country that I wanted to visit — many are clubs where Mr. Federer currently trains, others are places where he developed his game as a junior. .I found my opportunity that afternoon at  ., a posh club of well-groomed red clay courts with stunning views over Lake Zurich where Mr. Federer is known to practice. I cornered Alan, a club member who was enjoying a post-tennis coffee in the club’s cafe, and convinced him to hit with me for a few minutes. I was rusty, spraying balls around the court with little idea of where they might land. .The next day, I made my way by train and bus to the venerable  . a century-old lodge with a Turkish-style hammam nestled in the picturesque village of Lenzerheide, deep in the Swiss Alps in the canton of Graubünden. Roger and his family moved to the neighboring village of Valbella in 2012, and I wanted to understand why he had chosen to live in this out-of-the-way place, instead of one of Switzerland’s more famous winter resorts like Zermatt, Gstaad or St. Moritz. .I was hoping I might get a tryout with Toni Poltera, a gregarious morning host for the Romansch language radio service of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation and the president of  ., a club where Roger has trained on several occasions. Mr. Poltera drove us south on a snaking country road past villages perched on green hillsides below jagged peaks that would soon be full of snow toward the village of Lain. .As we got out to look at a remote playground where Mr. Poltera told me Roger Federer likes to take his family, it was easy to understand why he would want to live in such a place. “You see,” Mr. Poltera said, sweeping his right hand toward a snow-capped peak, “here Roger can have peace, he can play with his kids like a normal person.” .Turning north, we ventured into Valbella, a charming little community with a handful of businesses and Alpine-style homes perched across a hillside with views of Lake Heidsee and nearby mountains. I never asked Mr. Poltera to show me Mr. Federer’s house, but he pre-empted any potential request, explaining, “Roger lives here for privacy, that’s why we’re  .going to drive by his home.” .Tennisclub Felsberg, a half-hour drive down a zigzagging road from Valbella, is an out-of-the-way place with three courts situated along the Rhine. “We’re playing on Roger’s court,” Mr. Poltera said, pointing to a sign above Court 1 labeled “Roger Platz.” He led me to a small dressing room with a humble shower and sink. “You’ll get dressed and take your shower here, just like Roger does.” .I muffed several of my first shots but quickly found a groove and fell into a blissful tennis trance. .The next morning I woke up, stoked to finally see Mr. Federer play at the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel. I sat in an empty train carriage bathed in sunshine as it shadowed the Rhine, past crumbling medieval castles, spiky mountain peaks and hamlets spilling across carpets of green grass. .I arrived in plenty of time to watch Mr. Federer demolish the hapless Moldovan Radu Albot in his second-round match at the indoor  ., where Mr. Federer served as a ball boy as a kid. .In between matches, I explored Basel’s charming old town and visited a host of Federer sites, including ., the stately, 17th-century English manor house where Mr. Federer and his wife, Mirka, were married in 2009; the  ., where the tennis star honed his game as a child; and the “Swiss Tennis House”  . in Biel, where I met Yves Allegro, who was Mr. Federer’s roommate when they trained at the facility in 1997. .A few days later, I went to the five-star  . overlooking the Rhine, where cheeseburgers at the bar go for $48, and as I walked across the chandelier-heavy lobby, I nearly bumped into one of Mr. Federer’s twin daughters, who were joyfully bounding down a grand staircase with the tennis player’s father, Robert, trailing. .On the morning of the final, I took the tram to Münchenstein, the Basel suburb where Roger spent most of his childhood. Daniel Altermatt, a Münchenstein city councilperson, greeted me on the platform wearing a beret and dark sunglasses. He took me on an extensive tour of the town, starting with the small housing development called Wasserhaus, where Mr. Federer grew up. .His block felt narrow, too cramped for a person of his stature. Around the corner, on a small street with a canopy of trees, Mr. Altermatt explained how someone had tried to unofficially rename the street Roger Federer Allée. “We have a local regulation prohibiting us from naming anything after anyone who is still alive,” he said. “So if we want to name something after Roger, we’d have to kill him first.” .Mr. Altermatt drove me to the arena, where I bumped into Marc Dosch, who was there for the final with Abbot Federer. “I lost the abbot,” he said, and I wondered if perhaps he was giving Mr. Federer a prematch blessing. .Whatever the case, Mr. Federer was great once again, dismantling the Australian player  . a surprise finalist, to capture his record 10th Swiss Indoors title in what seemed like an anticlimactic final until Mr. Federer broke down in tears during his victory speech. He appeared in the pressroom carrying his trophy after the match, and this time he was still in his tennis gear. He had literally won the tournament without breaking a sweat. .I showed Mr. Federer a photo of him hoisting a trophy at age 10, that was given to me by Madeline Bärlocher, one of his first coaches at the Old Boys club, and asked him if the feeling of lifting trophies had changed over the years. “It’s similar,” he said, smiling. “It’s been an incredible journey, it definitely hit me hard being here in Basel. I don’t take these tournament victories as a normal thing, I take it as something quite unique and special even though it’s been a lot by now.” .And what, I asked, had triggered his tears on court. “When I stand there and look back at everything I had to go through, it really touches me,” he said. Mr. Federer said that he tends to break down depending “on the applause of the people, how warm it is, how much they feel that I’m struggling or not and how much love I get.” .As I waited for the tram, it started to rain and I remembered that I had my Roger Federer hat buried in my bag. I hadn’t worn it in more than a week, but now it was time to put my hat back on and return home — a tennis player once again.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/travel/roger-federer-switzerland.html
1,,"Life can change in an instant, as I experienced when I first laid my eyes on a tall and bizarrely striking bird known as the greater adjutant. .It was India in 2018, in the northeastern state of Assam. I’d ended up there partly because of absurd circumstances, which involved being filmed for a reality television pilot while navigating a motorized rickshaw through the Himalayas. After traversing some of the highest and most dangerous roads in the world, including the Tanglang La mountain pass, I ventured off to see a  .: Asian elephants, greater one-horned rhinos, western hoolock gibbons. .While en route to Guwahati, Assam’s capital, I saw a five-foot-tall bird towering near the roadside. I was so taken by its appearance that I asked the driver to pull over so I could have a better look. It had piercing blue eyes, an elongated electric-yellow neck, a wobbly, inflatable neck pouch, long legs that moved with a stiff military gait, and spindly black hairs atop its (mostly bald) prehistoric-looking head. Little did I know that this outlandish animal — also endangered, though not famously so — would change the course of my professional life. .Seeing how intrigued I was by the giant stork, the driver offered to take me to the site of the largest year-round population of greater adjutants in the world. .To my surprise, he led me to the sprawling Boragaon landfill, a dumpsite that borders the Deepor Beel wetland, an  . threatened by pollution and encroachment. .As we pulled into the landfill, I felt like I was entering a post-apocalyptic fever dream: Refuse was piled up higher than an East Village tenement building. I saw countless people, including young children, sorting through the garbage with their bare hands. Cows were grazing on medical waste, and feral dogs chased each other through the mountains of trash. All the while, an excavator kept pushing the trash heap taller and taller. .In the middle of this surreal scene, scavenging beside garbage-stained  ., were the spectacular greater adjutants, who were circling and stiffly marching alongside the other foragers. .After returning from India, I realized that my encounter with the greater adjutants had irrevocably changed me. Until then, I’d doggedly chased a career in New York City as a comedic ventriloquist while juggling mundane day jobs. Wildlife photography was relatively new to me; I had only considered it an enjoyable hobby. But suddenly I wanted to pursue conservation photography with every fiber of my being. .I quickly discovered the work of  ., a wildlife biologist who has dedicated her life to protecting greater adjutants. The founder of the  ., a local all-female, grass-roots volunteer conservation effort, Dr. Barman led her corps of women in protecting nesting sites, saving fallen baby birds and educating the Assamese community on the importance of these  .. .After corresponding with Dr. Barman for several months, I traveled back to Assam in February 2020. Dr. Barman invited me to stay at her home in Guwahati, where she lives with her husband, who is also a wildlife biologist, and her twin teenage daughters. .On our first visit together to the villages of Dadara, Pacharia and Singimari, on the outskirts of Guwahati, Dr. Barman continuously pointed out her car window at “hargilas,” the local word for greater adjutants that is derived from the Sanskrit word for “bone swallower.” I couldn’t believe how many of the birds were peering down at us from their huge nests and soaring on thermals high above our heads — especially since, in 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature estimated that only between 800 and 1,200 mature individuals were left in existence, with the population in decline. .Assam is the last stronghold of this endangered species, harboring more than 80 percent of the greater adjutant’s global population. (The remaining population is split between Cambodia and the Indian state of Bihar.) .In the past, Dr. Barman explained, greater adjutants were viewed as unsanitary nuisances and believed to be bad omens, resulting in many of their nesting trees being cut down. Much of the Hargila Army’s efforts are aimed at protecting such trees. .The group’s efforts are also directed at rehabilitating society’s perception of the birds — to “bring the birds into the hearts, minds and cultures of the people,” Dr. Barman said. Conservation work has long been plagued by  ., since humans generally favor  .. “The more people who see hargilas as a bad omen, disease-carrier and pest,” Dr. Barman told me, “the more I am obsessed.” .The work has paid dividends. The greater adjutant’s local population has risen to an estimated 950 birds, up from 400 birds in 2007. The number of nesting colonies in the villages of Dadara, Pacharia and Singimari has also risen during the same interval — to 220 nests, up from 28. .In recent years the Hargila Army has grown to include thousands of pledged members — people who have received some level of conservation training — and around 400 women who are actively involved in leading the movement. Most of its organizers are rural homemakers who are helping to integrate an appreciation for greater adjutants into local traditions. They  . and even throw baby showers for the birds during the breeding season. .The most distinctive awareness program I witnessed was at a local wedding that included effigies of the giant bird guarding the entrance and hargila-themed henna drawn on the hands and arms of wedding guests, myself included. .Dr. Barman’s efforts have led to a broader sense of empowerment among the women who make up the Hargila Army. Many receive tools and training — including donated hand looms and sewing machines — that can help them earn additional income. .“It seems like our life has completely changed after integrating hargila motifs into our clothes,” said a member of the Hargila Army named Jonali Rajbongshi, who, after receiving a new sewing machine, began sewing cotton bags embroidered with greater adjutants. .We also visited the house of a woman named Pratibha Malakar, who wove a red-and-white hargila gamosa — a traditional  . — with transfixing speed and expertise. .Dr. Barman told me that her community conservation model could easily be reproduced in other parts of the world. “Women are the key and the biggest change makers,” she explained. “When we educate women, when we involve women, we achieve a sustainable goal.” .Awareness programs among local schools are another of the group’s tactics, and I went along with Dr. Barman on a few such surprise visits. Her presentations, which include lively discussions, informational pamphlets, educational games and coloring pages, had the students on the edges of their seats. .Near the end of my time in Assam, I accompanied Dr. Barman and her team back to the Boragaon landfill, where she led an outreach program. Children sat among the debris, eating sweets and coloring in drawings of the eccentric storks. .In the middle of her presentation, I looked around to find our corner of the landfill filled with laughter and gaiety. It was an unexpected joyous moment: all of us brought together from such different circumstances by a remarkable woman and an endangered, if often overlooked, scavenger — the unlikely target of a spellbinding and transformative conservation campaign.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/travel/india-greater-adjutant-stork.html
2,,"For six days, Paul Theroux, the famous American travel writer, dined on hard-boiled eggs, microwaved dal and wine. .He had set out cross-country in a rented Jeep Compass on the day before Thanksgiving, driving from Cape Cod, where he has a house, to Los Angeles, where he delivered boxes of his papers to his archives at Huntington Library, and then flying on to Hawaii, his other home. .Theroux said he observed a landscape largely emptied out by the coronavirus pandemic, from deserted motels in Sallisaw, Okla., and Tucumcari, N.M., where he stopped to sleep, to a rest area in Tennessee where he had his solitary Thanksgiving meal, and the In-N-Out Burger in Kingman, Ariz., on his last day on the road. Every night, as is his habit, he wrote out in longhand all he had seen. .“It was like a panning shot of America,” he said in a video interview from the North Shore of Oahu, where he has lived off and on for over 30 years. .Theroux turns 80 in April. For a generation of backpackers now gone gray, the tattered paperback accounts of his treks through China, Africa and South America were a prod to adventure, bibles of inspiration under many a mosquito net. He has a new novel out from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in April, “Under the Wave at Waimea,” and his best-known book (and  . among them), “ .,” has been adapted into a television series starring his nephew, Justin Theroux, also set to premiere next month. .If this seems like a moment to take stock of an intrepid life and an almost extreme output of writing, Theroux does not see himself as anywhere near done. Before Covid-19 struck, he had plans to go to central Africa. He is deep into another novel and finishing up a new story collection. He himself can’t seem to keep track of the number of books he has written: “Fifty-something maybe?” (It’s actually 56.) .Travel narratives are his signature, a genre he grabbed onto in the early 1970s out of desperation when, as a young novelist with a few books under his belt, he found himself out of ideas. He decided to traverse part of the world by rail, starting from London, where he was living, through the Middle East and as far as Southeast Asia, returning on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The account that emerged from this tiring journey, “ .,” has sold over 1.5 million copies and inspired shelves upon shelves of books built on similar conceits. .In just the past decade, Theroux has written about  . (he always travels alone) in “On the Plain of Snakes” (2019); an exploration of some of the poorest regions of his own country in “ .” (2015); and a trip to Africa, “ .” (2013), in which he returned to regions he got to know as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s. .This genre — the outsider arrives and offers an assessment of the foreign — has lost ground over the years to travel memoirs like Elizabeth Gilbert’s “ .” that describe journeys of the internal terrain as much as the people encountered and places seen. Theroux, sitting at his desk scattered with artifacts of those trips — tiny Buddhas, the skull of a scrimshawed monkey he was given in Bali, wooden Polynesian weapons — defended his approach. .“It’s more necessary than ever to find the empathetic experience of meeting another person, being in another culture, to smell it, to suffer it, to put up with the hardship and the nuisances of travel, all of that matters,” Theroux said. He quoted the Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul, who at various moments in Theroux’s writing career  .: “I believe that the present, accurately seized, foretells the future.” .And Theroux agrees. “You don’t have to make forecasts,” he said. “You just write about the things that you see, the things that you hear, the things that you sense, and when you write that, you’re a prophet.” .But there is no great thirst for prophets these days, particularly of the sort who offer judgments of other cultures. Theroux seems aware of this, or at least of the notion that his way of writing about the world is fading. .His new novel tells the story of Joe Sharkey, an aging North Shore surfer who resembles characters Theroux has gotten to know on the beaches near his home. Sharkey feels acutely that he is being overtaken by younger surfers with big endorsements. For him, surfing was a way of life, an existence centered on catching waves, a commitment to the ocean. .Theroux sees surfing as a metaphor for his own life. All he ever wanted was to be able to write without interruption, without the distraction of car alarms going off outside his window or bills arriving in the mail, without the need to do anything else for money but sit day after day at his desk. In many ways, Theroux has achieved this. But like the surfer past his prime, he is not immune to feeling forgotten, to the sense that the world has become hostile to the pure joy of the waves. There’s a fear of being overlooked, unread. .“I was once a hot shot, I was once the punk,” Theroux said. “And anyone who has once been a punk, eventually you’re older, and you see the turning of the years as it is. We all feel it, every writer. They might deny it. But they do, they all feel it.” .There was no sign of Theroux’s storied grumpiness. Critiques of his books have often touched on their cruelly ironic tone, a sense of condescension toward people he meets and fictional characters he creates. Take Stephen King’s assessment in The Book Review of the lightly autobiographical “ .” from 2017, which King found to be an “exercise in self-regarding arrogance and self-pity.” .Theroux gets that readers might perceive him as cranky, but he thinks the problem might be with the readers. “You cannot be a grumpy traveler. You will not get anywhere,” he said. “You’ll be killed, you’ll be insulted, you won’t be able to travel. So you need to get along with people. I think that I’m characterized as cantankerous perhaps because if you see things the way they are, and you just describe things the way they are, you can be accused of being unkind.” .One of his oldest friends, the British  ., with whom Theroux has swapped manuscripts over the decades, thinks critics have missed an important shift in Theroux’s writing. “Compared to the tone of the earlier work, its sarcasm, its sharp observation and always being from the point of view of an absolute outsider, Paul has developed a kind of humanity in the recent books that I hadn’t seen before,” Raban said. .He pointed to a  . about a pet goose named Willy whom Theroux raised from birth and cradled in his arms as he died, the animal’s blue eyes gone gray, in a moment described with aching vulnerability. For Raban, this piece, like Theroux’s past few books, signals a move closer to the reader. “From savage sarcasm to tenderness is a pretty long journey,” Raban said. .Age has also played its role. Theroux sees advantages in it, like the older surfer whose decreased stamina forces him to search for new, smarter ways to ride his board — after all, Theroux points out, it was a man in his late 40s, Garrett McNamara, who surfed the largest recorded wave. Theroux can see how traveling as an octogenarian will have its assets. In some cultures, older people are invisible, a benefit in many situations, he said. .In other places he has visited, the elderly are treated with respect. “They either jump out of their chair and give it to you, or they just ignore you,” Theroux said. .And where might he want to go to next? “There are lots of places I’d like to go,” he said. “And there are lots of places I’ve never been. I’ve never been to Scandinavia, but I don’t have any desire to go there.” .What he most wants to do is return. There is value in making your way back to a country you visited when you were younger. It both marks time in your own life and acts as a sort of gauge for how a society is changing. .“It tells you about the direction of the world,” Theroux said. “What’s going to happen to the world? And you find that you can extrapolate that by revisiting a place that you knew well. Going back to England, going back to Malawi, going back to China, to India. It’s a fascinating thing. So if you ask me what travel I’m most looking forward to: I like going back to places.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/books/paul-theroux-under-the-wave-at-waimea.html

4,,"Over the course of the decade since I first visited, I have often imagined myself at home in New Orleans. I think of the syncopated shuffle of a snare drum, the simple pleasure of an afternoon walk with a to-go beer in hand and the candy-colored shotgun houses that sink into the ground at odd angles. And so it wasn’t a huge surprise when, at the beginning of 2021, I found myself packing up my life and moving to the Crescent City for a few months. Why not be somewhere I love at this difficult time, I thought? Why not live in my daydreams for a little while? . is above all else resilient.

In recent months, brass bands have taken to street corners in front of masked, socially distant spectators instead of packed night clubs. Strangers still chat you up about the  . from their front porches. My visions of this city may still be filtered through the fuzzy lens of a visitor, but I know I’ll be pretending I’m still there long after I’m gone. Here are a few ways you can, too. .New Orleans music is a collage of sounds: it’s the birthplace of jazz, of the frenetic dance music known as  ., popularized by superstars like  ., the call-and-response songs of  ., and so much more. For an overview of the sounds of this loud, percussive city there is no better place to start than the wonderfully eclectic  ., a community-supported radio station that has been on the air since 1980. Luckily, you can listen to it from anywhere  .. It’s only a matter of time before you start getting to know the various D.J.s and tuning in for your favorites. .“New Orleans is not a periphery music scene,” Soul Sister, who has hosted  . for more than 25 years, told me. “New Orleans is the reason for it all.” Soul Sister was one of a handful of local experts I consulted in putting together  . that will send you straight to New Orleans. Among her recommendations are  . and the music of  ., which brings her back to afternoons spent celebrating on the street: “It reminds me of the energy and freedom of being at the second line parades on Sundays, dancing through all the neighborhoods nonstop for three or four hours,” she said. .On this playlist, you will also find some classics — the rollicking piano of  ., for example, starts it off — recommended by Keith Spera who writes about music for the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate. By the end of the playlist, you will undoubtedly agree with Mr. Spera’s assessment of New Orleans music: “There is no singular style of ‘New Orleans music’ — is it jazz? Rhythm & blues? Funk? Bounce? — but you know it when you hear it.” .Just like its music, New Orleans food contains multitudes: Creole, Cajun, African, Vietnamese and other flavors collide like nowhere else. A fine place to start is with the  ., the collected recipes of  ., who died in 2019, of Dooky Chase’s Restaurant, an institution that has hosted civil rights leaders, presidents and countless regulars at its location in Treme, the neighborhood where jazz was born.

Festival and second line crowds come to her for ya-ka-mein, a salty beef noodle soup often eaten as a late-night snack or a next-morning cure (hence its “Old Sober” moniker). The dish’s origins are mysterious: a product of cultural exchange involving, depending on who you ask, Black soldiers returning from the Korean War or Chinese railroad workers arriving in the 1800s. Ms. Linda’s family recipe is also a mystery (she credits the globe-trotting chef  . for encouraging her to keep it secret). But she has shared  ., so you can try your hand at it at home. “That will get you pretty close to the real thing,” she said with a wink I could almost hear over the phone. .New Orleans is a city full of history and it can be hard to know what you are looking at without some guidance.

It’s also an often-overlooked part of New Orleans drinking culture, according to Deniseea Taylor, a cocktail enthusiast who goes by the  .. “When you find a bar with a set-up, you are truly in Nola,” Ms. Taylor said. “First time I experienced a set-up, it was paired with a $5 fish plate, a match made in heaven.” .It should come as no surprise that New Orleans, with its triumphant and tragic history, its syncretic culture and its pervasive love of fun, is a place of stories.

5,Family Travel Gets Complicated Without a Covid Vaccine for Kids,"Nearly every summer, Ada Ayala, a teacher, and her husband, Oscar Cesar Pleguezeulos, travel with their children to visit Mr. Cesar Pleguezeulos’s parents in Spain. But this year, even though they will both soon be fully vaccinated in their home state of Florida, they are changing their plans. The reason? There is still no pediatric Covid-19 vaccine available for their kids. .The travel industry, buoyed by news of vaccine rollouts, is  . after a year of devastation. But amid the chatter of travel’s long-awaited rebound, many families with children —  . — say they are largely being left out of the conversation. .In a March survey on  ., an online community for traveling families, 90 percent of respondents said that amid unclear guidelines on Covid-19 testing, they were searching for flexible bookings. The topic also comes up often on Bébé Voyage’s Facebook page, particularly among parents in the United States. “It’s the Americans in the group that are the most nervous traveling with kids,” said the Bébé Voyage chief executive, Marianne Perez de Fransius. .Ms. Ayala, 44, is among those nervous parents. “If it wasn’t for the kids, we would definitely be flying this summer,” she said. Ms. Ayala already received her shot as a teacher. Her husband, also 44, will soon receive his shots, too, because Florida recently opened vaccinations to those age 40 and up. But their children, Charlise, 6, and Oscar, 2, will have to wait many more months to be inoculated. .“My 2-year-old isn’t going to wear a mask for 10 hours on a flight, and I don’t know if I want to expose him for a 16-hour trip with layovers,” Ms. Ayala said. “I’ll feel more confident when vaccination reaches more people worldwide, or at least in the destinations we want to go.” . have now received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. But a full pediatric Covid-19 vaccine currently isn’t expected until the end of 2021 at the earliest, and while they wait, parents are struggling to figure out how they, too, can travel safely this summer, and even where their children are welcome as rules on quarantine and testing continue to shift. .“This is the elephant in the room right now,” said Cate Caruso, an adviser for Virtuoso, a network of luxury travel agencies, who also owns her own travel planning company,  .. The potential that a child could become infected with Covid-19 while abroad and not be allowed on a return flight, she said, is a major deterrent for parents. “Anywhere you go outside of the U.S. right now, you’ve got to think about how you’re going to get back in,” she said. “It’s leaving behind a whole bunch of people who are ready to go.” .In Ms. Ayala’s case, a compromise has been struck: If and when Spain — which is currently closed to American travelers — opens its borders, Mr. Cesar will travel to Spain with their daughter, Charlise, while Ms. Ayala will remain in Florida with Oscar. “She goes to school and is very good with wearing her mask, cleaning her hands and keeping distance,” Ms. Ayala said of her daughter. “So I think she can be safe. But it’s just not possible with a baby.” .But she doesn’t plan to stay home all summer. Whether or not her husband and daughter make it to Spain, Ms. Ayala is planning a family road trip at some point this summer, likely within Florida. .After a year of  .,  . and  ., many Americans are now ready to fly again: Online searches for late-summer flights are up as much as 75 percent, and hotels on both coasts are reporting that they are sold out through October. But families, more than any other travel sector, continue to play it safe. .Rovia, a membership-based global travel agency that works with both travelers and travel agents, reports that beach and camping destinations within driving distance are the most popular choices for families this summer. An exception? Disney World, which is seeing an uptick in reservations for summer from families looking to visit while capacity remains limited (and lines, as a result, remain shorter). .“The rate of couples traveling by air has increased faster, whereas families are still leaning toward travel by car and R.V. rentals,” said Jeff Gwynn, Rovia’s director of communications. .Montoya and Phil Hudson, who showcase their travels as a Black family on their popular blog,  ., are among them. “Most years we go pretty far — Spain, Italy, France, as far as we can go. This year it was about what’s reachable by car,” Ms. Hudson said. She and Mr. Hudson, who both work in the health care industry, are vaccinated, but admit they probably won’t be willing to fly with their two daughters, Leilah, 11, and Layla, 8, for several more months. .That’s because they want to wait for herd immunity to help keep their daughters safe. “The goal is to wait until the majority of the population is vaccinated, or has at least had the opportunity to become vaccinated,” Ms. Hudson said. .In addition to preferring driving over flying this summer, travel analysts say families with children will also continue to opt for rental homes over hotel rooms. .In fact, when it comes to the vacation cottage market, parents are booking faster than anyone else. “Families are the number one group expected to travel in 2021,” said Vered Schwarz, the president and chief operating officer of  ., a short-term property management platform which reports that its summer reservations are already 110 percent higher than 2020, with families comprising more than 30 percent of those booking. “For families with unvaccinated children, private rentals are appealing — they are comfortable and they avoid hotels chock-full of crowded common areas,” she said. .The question of how to treat unvaccinated children who may be traveling with their parents is also presenting a legal and ethical minefield for American travel operators. .The European Union is considering a  . that  . for those who can show proof of inoculation. In Israel, a  . has been established for those who have been vaccinated, granting holders not just the ability to cross a border but also check into a hotel or eat inside a restaurant, but children are not exempt — so parents with unvaccinated children must dine outside at restaurants and find babysitters before heading to the gym or a show. .But in the United States, such policies are unlikely to take hold, said Chuck Abbott, the general manager of the InterContinental San Diego. “Most hotels would not ask for that information, because it violates the privacy of the guest,” he said. “Even putting vaccinated guests on a different floor than other guests would likely present a legal issue.” .Compared with summer 2019, families’ plans for summer 2021 are more low-key: Travelocity reports that bookings to Mount Rushmore and Nashville are significantly up over two years ago; internationally, family bookings to London, Paris and Rome, destinations that were top family sites in 2019, but have still not reopened to U.S. travel, are way down, while Cancún, which is currently open to American travelers without quarantine requirements, is up nearly 50 percent. .Some European countries, like Iceland, have begun inching open their borders, but only to passengers who are vaccinated. That means individuals who can present proof of the Covid-19 jab can bypass quarantine when they arrive — unless they are parents traveling with children. .“Unvaccinated children would still need to quarantine for five days, and the parents, of course, must stay with the child,” said Eric Newman, who owns the travel blog  .. “Iceland’s brand-new travel regulations are not friendly to families hoping to visit with children.” .After a year of virtual schooling and working from home, parents have no desire to quarantine with their kids, said Anthony Berklich, the founder of the travel platform  .. “What these destinations are basically saying is you can come but your children can’t,” he said. .Instead, families are opting for warm-weather destinations closer to home. .When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in January that  . of all air passengers arriving in the United States, many tropical resorts — including  . — began offering not just free on-site testing, but a deeply discounted room in which to quarantine in case that test comes back positive. That move, said Rebecca Alesia, a travel consultant with  ., has been a boon for family travel business. .“What happens if the morning you’re supposed to come home, you get up and Junior has a surprise positive test?” she said. “A lot of my clients have booked this summer because of this policy.” .For parents struggling to decide how and when to return to travel, there is good news on the horizon, said Dr. Shruti Gohil, the medical director of infection prevention at the University of California, Irvine. .“The chances of a good pediatric vaccine coming soon are high,” she said, noting that both Pfizer and Moderna are already running pediatric trials on their vaccines. “There is no reason to think that the vaccine will have any untoward effects on children that we haven’t already noted in adults.” .In the meantime, she said, parents with children need to continue to be cautious. That doesn’t mean families shouldn’t travel at all, but she recommends choosing to drive rather than fly; to not allow unvaccinated children to play unmasked with children from other households; and to remain vigilant about wearing masks and regularly washing hands while on the road. .“We can’t keep saying that you can’t go anywhere,” she said. “At some point we have to have some kind of nuance around this. But this is a game we are all still playing until the virus is gone.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/travel/children-family-vaccines.html
6,Air Travel Is Already Back to Normal in Some Places. Here’s Where.,"In Florida, Key West International Airport is busier than normal, while Miami International has half as many passengers as it did before the pandemic. .In the West, big-city airports — in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle — are serving a fraction of their typical traveler volume, between 24 percent and 46 percent. But smaller regional airports, near Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Colorado ski country, have passenger volume as much as 12 percent higher than this time last year. .This pattern is typical across the country, detailed new data shows. Large hub airports have just a fraction of the travelers they did at this time last year, even as Americans are returning to flying, particularly to vacation destinations. .“You see airports in Colorado, Montana, Key West having recovered quite a lot,” said Kevin Williams, a Yale economist who studies air travel data. “And then you have a lot of major cities that are still down quite a lot.” .He has compiled granular Transportation Security Administration data that tracks how many people move through airport screening checkpoints. It shows that, with  . and states rolling back  ., Americans are returning to leisure travel in large numbers. .But airports that serve major cities are still serving far fewer travelers than they did early last year. Washington National, close to the District of Columbia, is down 70 percent in passenger volume. San Francisco International is serving a quarter of its typical volume, and Kennedy Airport in New York is at about one-third. .This may reflect in part the slower return of business travel. These hub airports also tend to have many international flights, which are expected to take longer to recover. Additionally, many urban attractions for leisure travelers — Broadway theaters in New York City, the Smithsonian museums in Washington — remain closed because of the pandemic. .A few dozen smaller airports, where travel is thriving in spite of growing coronavirus case numbers nationally, appear to fall into two categories: those especially close to outdoor vacation destinations, and those serving communities whose residents are more willing to travel amid a pandemic. .“The only thing that is different is the masks,” said Richard Strickland, airport director at Key West International, who has flown five times in the last five months. “We’re now busier than we were in 2019.” .Idaho Falls Regional Airport is about two hours from Yellowstone National Park, which attracted many visitors last year. The airport’s passenger volume is now 80 percent of what it was last year — a stronger recovery than at the state’s largest airport, in Boise, which is at roughly 60 percent of its regular travel volume. .Two other airports that serve Yellowstone, one in Wyoming and another in Montana, were fully back to prepandemic travel volume in early March. .“For late summer and through the fall, we were seeing close to the same numbers that we’d had in 2019,” said Rick Cloutier, executive director of the Idaho Falls airport. “We were fortunate recipients of the people’s desire to get to the great outdoors.” .Passenger volume has returned to normal at Canyonlands Field airport in Utah, near Arches National Park. On Florida’s Gulf Coast, airports near beaches are having a similarly good year. There were 24 percent more passengers passing through Northwest Florida Beaches airport in early March than around that time last year. .Airports in one outdoors vacation destination have remained notably empty, though: Hawaii’s airports are down between 51 percent and 84 percent in passenger volume. The state, which has had .Covid cases, requires visitors to obtain a negative test within  . or to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival, making travel there more complicated. The longer time spent on a flight may also scare away potential passengers. .Willingness to travel by airplane may also vary from one city to another. Americans have reacted differently to strategies to minimize the pandemic’s spread,  . and  .to varying levels. .“We seem to have been filling up when everybody else isn’t,” said Steve Gleason, executive director of Provo Municipal Airport. His airport is small — usually just about four or so flights a day — but busy. It’s not especially close to any national park. .Passenger traffic is down 2 percent compared with last year, while Salt Lake City International, an hour away, is still down 40 percent. Mr. Gleason says most of the rebound has to do with passengers traveling to see family through the pandemic or to students who attend Brigham Young University, which is holding in-person classes this semester. .“Most of our traffic is family traffic; they just kept flying,” he said. “It seems like everything shut down pretty solidly for two or three months, and then everybody picked back up again.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/upshot/flights-rebounding-vacations.html
7,The T List: Five Things We Recommend This Week,"visit This .Carmine Morales ran the tiny, locally beloved luncheonette Classic Coffee Shop .— one of the few remaining places in downtown New York where you could get a truly no-frills grilled cheese — on Hester Street for over 40 years before deciding to retire last .December. But he has entrusted the storefront, along with his decades-old drip coffee machine, to two new tenants: .the clothing designer  . and her partner, the furniture designer  ., who will keep it running in service to the neighborhood, if in a slightly different way. The couple have spent the past few weeks subtly reimagining the space as a hybrid coffee and tailoring shop, leaving the Styrofoam ceiling tiles in place but updating the counter at the front with vintage ’60-era teak stools from India and adding bent-metal sconces by Green River Project (the studio Aujla runs with his collaborator, Ben Bloomstein). At the back of the space, they’ve installed a bank of sewing machines, along with a plush changing area enveloped by a thick tobacco-colored velvet curtain. The flagship store of Bode’s namesake clothing brand, which offers one-of-a-kind pieces handmade from repurposed textiles such as vintage quilts and bed linens, is just next door, and she has long believed that garments should be altered and maintained over a lifetime. Offering a dedicated location for tailoring felt like an obvious next step. “I think it will open some of our clients’ eyes to the fact that it’s easy to shop in a way where there aren’t limitations based on size,” she says. But the space, which will open on Friday, is also intended as a resource for anyone with a textile conservation project or simple alteration need: “People can bring their grandmother’s saris but also their Levi’s jeans.” The Classic Coffee Shop was a family operation — it was Morales’s father who originally took over the space in 1976 — and Bode and Aujla will build on this tradition by weaving in their own personal histories: The coffee will be mixed with cardamom, just as Aujla’s grandmother served her Folgers after she moved from Punjab to Canada in the 1950s, and he eventually plans to offer Indian sweets, including jalebi and laddus. “But nothing fancy,” he says.  .book This .In the heart of central Portugal, near the Biblioteca Joanina, the University of Coimbra’s 18th-century Rococo-style library, is a new boutique hotel that will open in May from the storied Swedish bedding brand  . whose mission is to provide guests with one of the world’s best sleep experiences. Each of the 15 rooms at the Hästens Sleep Spa comes .equipped with one of the company’s triple-spring beds, which were carefully designed for optimal pressure, relief and support, while portions of its walls are adorned with decorative gold-plated marble that’s been hand-carved to resemble book spines. During a stay, guests can select an actual book from any number of shelves spread throughout the hotel to take with them when they turn in for the night. There is also an array of digital programming that helps create a soothing ambience, including relaxing soundtracks available through a mobile app and an in-room television channel called “Bed Talks,” hosted by the sleep expert Dr. Edie Perry, who shares insights on topics such as how to position one’s neck for quality rest and how best to support the lumbar spine throughout the night. To top it off, guests have access to an on-call sleep specialist for the duration of their stay and can select from a pillow menu of five options, all made from goose feathers and down and ranging from soft to extra firm.  .covet This .When Calico Wallpaper founders Rachel and Nick Cope designed their Aurora collection, consisting of 16 different multicolored ombrés, in 2013, they drew on memories of the various horizons they’d seen on their extensive travels — from seascapes in Tulum to sunsets in Tuscany. Stuck in their New York home last year, the couple found a new way to bring a global perspective to their work: They invited four international design studios to craft their own Aurora prints, each one just as personal as the originals. Launching this week, the new series — called Dawn — includes the Swiss designer  .’s cotton candy-like pink-and-teal version, inspired by .walks taken with his young daughter along the shore of Lake Neuchâtel in Romandy, and a dark blend of yellow and blue by the Shanghai-based duo Lyndon Neri and Rossana Hu of Neri & Hu that references their favorite Vermeer paintings. Milan’s Dimore Studio .chose a moody brick-red fade “that conjures the feelings of a smoke-filled lounge in the 1970s,” says Rachel, while Sabine Marcelis captured the orange-gray sky that can be seen from her studio in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, .at sundown. The couple gave their collaborators free rein, notes Rachel, and had each studio select a nonprofit organization — the U.N. Refugee Agency and the Environmental Defense Fund are among those chosen — to receive 5 percent of the proceeds from its design.  .see This .Work by the pioneering American land artist  . — perhaps best known for .“ .” (1973-76), a series of four concrete cylinders that are each 18 feet long and 9 feet in diameter, and are installed in aeternum in Utah’s desert flats — will be on display, beginning this week, at Ireland’s Lismore Castle Arts. Curated by Lisa Le Feuvre, the executive director at the Holt-Smithson Foundation, which upholds the legacies of both Holt and her husband, the artist Robert Smithson, “Light and Language” explores Holt’s output between 1966 and 1982 and includes indoor and outdoor installations, as well as photography and film. (There will also be a selection of pieces by five other artists, all of whom see their work as being in conversation with Holt’s: A.K. Burns, Matthew Day Jackson, Dennis McNulty, Charlotte Moth and Katie Paterson.) For Le Feuvre, the exhibition’s setting will be crucial to how it’s experienced: It’s “like going to see ‘Tunnels,’” she says, in that “you get a sense of slowness, quietness and localness.” But Lismore Castle, a winding hour-and-a-half drive from Cork, sits in stark .contrast to the empty vistas of the American West. The property dates back to 1185, and some believe its gardens — which will frame several outdoor works by Holt, including “Locator P.S.1.” (1971), a kind of prototype for “Tunnels” — to be the country’s oldest. Also on view will be “Electrical System” (1982), a constellation of 80-plus light bulbs powered by a continuous network of interlocking steel arches that the artist once described as a “fountain of electricity,” and “Boomerang” (1974), a video made in collaboration with the artist Richard Serra, and originally broadcast on live TV. The clip stars a young Nancy Holt, who at one point says, “My mind goes out into the world and then comes back.”  .wear This .At some point during these last few months, I began to despise what I wore every day so much that I fantasized about burning my clothes the moment we all emerge — like butterflies from our cocoons — from lockdown. Instead, I found Baserange, a Parisian brand of basic wear that is a little more elevated and stylish than my old gym clothes and pajamas, but doesn’t sacrifice the comfort and practicality my more hermetic existence now demands. The line .launched in 2012 with foundation garments, including bras without underwire. “We did not want to dictate a certain shape for breasts,” said the co-founders Blandine de Verdelhan and Marie-Louise Mogensen over email. “We felt women were placed in a very limited frame, a frame where there was little movement.” Since then, Baserange has grown to include similarly elegant ready-to-wear pieces, such as dresses, tops, bottoms and much more. All of its clothes are made with natural fibers, including bamboo and organic cotton, as both sustainability and equality are important to the company. The recently launched  . is offered in a new palette of browns and tans intended to echo the diversity of human complexions. And small touches on its classic items, like the wide ribbing on a pair of sweatpants or an artful seam on a turtleneck, have allowed me to venture to an art gallery or an outdoor dinner at a nice restaurant without panicking that I’ve lost all sense of my sartorial self.  .From T’s Instagram",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/t-magazine/calico-wallpaper-portugal-hotel.html
8,"For Korea’s Golfers Eyeing the Olympics, More Than Four Is a Crowd","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — So Yeon Ryu is a two-time major winner and a former world No. 1 who entered this week’s ANA Inspiration, the first L.P.G.A. major of the year, as a top 20 player. Ryu’s credentials for the Tokyo Olympics this summer are solid gold. .Her passport is her problem. .Ryu is from South Korea, where champion women golfers are an abundant natural resource. With three months until the team rosters for the delayed Summer Games in Tokyo are finalized, Ryu is No. 16 in the world but No. 7 in her homeland. .The Olympic qualification standards dictate that every player in the top 15 is eligible to compete but that no country can have more than four representatives in the 60-player field. Led by Jin Young Ko, Koreans hold the top three spots. .“I don’t know that there’s a harder team in sport to make right now,” said Mike Whan, the departing L.P.G.A. commissioner. .In 2016, when golf returned to the Olympics as a medal sport for the first time since 1904, Ryu missed a berth on the South Korean team despite a top-12 world ranking. .“It’s tougher to make the team from my country than to win the gold medal,” said Ryu, who opened with an even-par 72 Thursday at Mission Hills. Patty Tavatanakit of Thailand shot a six-under-par 66 to lead the field. .South Korean champions have been plentiful over the past decade, capturing 23 of the 47 L.P.G.A. majors contested. They occupy 14 of the top 35 spots in  .. For players desiring to distinguish themselves, making the Olympic team is a priority. .“So many players are playing so well from Korea that I want to say people back home are less appreciative to see what we’re doing on the tour,” said Ryu, 30, whose major titles came at the 2011 United States Women’s Open and the 2017 ANA Inspiration, both in playoffs. “They’re more keen to see the Olympics because they know it’s really, really tough to make the team.” .Inbee Park, Ryu’s best friend and compatriot, won the women’s competition at the Rio Olympics, by five strokes over New Zealand’s Lydia Ko, then the top-ranked player. With the country’s  ., Korean officials were confident of at least one medal in the women’s competition. Park overcame a wrist injury that had slowed her progress all year and delivered on the expectations. .No stranger to the spotlight, she took the golf world on a thrilling ride in 2013 when she  . in a bid to become the first professional, male or female, to win four in the same year. But never, Park said, had she felt more pressure. After arriving in Brazil, Park absorbed the sense of urgency radiated by the archers, the swimmers, the taekwondo athletes and the handball players representing Korea who have one chance every four years to craft their legacies. .“You get so much attention from the people and the country and from everyone pretty much,” Park, now 32 and a seven-time major champion, said this week. “I think it’s double, triple, probably 10 times more pressure than I ever felt in a major championship.” .Whan said the telecast of Park’s final round drew a 27.1 rating in South Korea. To put that in context, he said,  . at the 2013 Women’s British Open — she finished 14 strokes behind the winner, Stacy Lewis — got an 8, which was roughly the same as the rating for Tiger Woods’s victorious final round at the 2019 Masters. .“So imagine Tiger at Augusta times three,” Whan said. “She went from being a really noteworthy golfer to being one of the most famous people in Korea in one weekend.” .Ryu didn’t plan to watch any of the 2016 Olympics coverage. “I was so close to making the team that it definitely hurt for me,” Ryu said. “I wanted to avoid it as much as I can.” .She added, “But when you know your best friend is rocking it in Rio, you have to watch.” .Ryu was glad she saw Park clinch the gold. She credits Park’s performance in the Olympics with her own victory at Mission Hills and ascent to No. 1 the following year. .“Before Rio I was maybe so afraid, ‘What is going to happen if I miss the Olympics?’” Ryu said. “So I almost just wanted to believe winning a major is better than the Olympics.” .She added: “After Inbee won the gold medal, I was definitely jealous — not of her but because I felt she did something that was big for the whole golf industry. Maybe that motivation really helped me to play well in 2017.” .In 2018, South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In a nod to her new stature, Park was chosen as one of the final torch bearers. As she ran with the flame into the Olympic Stadium, slowly to avoid tripping in conditions so cold she could hardly feel her feet, her friend Ryu sat awe-struck in the crowd of 35,000. .After being so near the top 10 and still so far from qualifying for the 2016 Olympics, Ryu recognized it might be her only chance to experience an Olympics up close.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/golf/golf-olympics-women-lpga.html

11,Frontier Airlines I.P.O. Signals a Travel Industry Recovery,"The pandemic is far from over, but some airlines believe the travel business is already on an upswing. .On Thursday, Frontier Airlines, a budget carrier that is based in Denver and known for putting images of wild animal on its planes, became the second airline this year to list its shares on a stock exchange. Before trading began, Frontier said it expected to raise $266 million by selling 15 million shares at $19 each on Nasdaq under the symbol ULCC, a nod to its strategy as an “ultra-low-cost carrier.” Another 15 million shares will be sold by Frontier’s existing stockholders. .The industry may be struggling through one of the worst crises in its history, but travel is starting to recover and carriers like Frontier and Sun Country Airlines, which finished an initial public offering in mid-March, say they are well positioned for the rebound. Unlike the largest airlines, budget carriers don’t rely on corporate or international travel, which are not expected to bounce back any time soon. Frontier and Sun Country offer domestic flights to passengers visiting family or friends or going on leisure trips, the kind who have been leading the recovery. .“The time is now,” Barry Biffle, the airline’s president and chief executive, said in an interview. “If you look, the vaccine is unlocking the demand, and you’re seeing it everywhere. You’re seeing it in restaurants, you’re seeing it in hotels.” .Many investors seem to agree. Sun Country’s stock price jumped more than 40 percent when it hit the market a couple of weeks ago. Shares of established airlines have also rallied in recent months. Shares in Frontier, which has a $4 billion market capitalization, closed down less than 1 percent on Thursday. .Some optimism may be warranted. For three weeks now, well over one million people have been screened each day at airport checkpoints, according to Transportation Security Administration data, a sign that travel is rebounding. .“We can see that light at the end of the tunnel,” Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines,  .. “Domestic leisure demand has almost entirely recovered. It tells you something about the pent-up desire for travel, the pent-up desire to remake those connections with people.” .Frontier, the last of the nation’s 10 largest airlines to go public, said it planned to use the money it raised to buy equipment, invest in sales and marketing, repay debt and shore up its cash reserves. The offering is expected to close on April 6. .The airline’s business model may be well suited for a recovery, but risks abound. The recovery could be derailed if the Covid-19 vaccines prove ineffective at providing long-term protection or if they fail to shield people from new coronavirus variants. .A spike in jet fuel prices, which account for about a quarter of Frontier’s costs, could hinder its ability to keep fares low. And competition will probably be fierce in the years ahead. Discount companies will be up against one another as well as the four big airlines — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United and Southwest Airlines, which have vast resources and are eager to make up lost revenue. .Still, the initial public offering marks an impressive turnaround for Frontier, which sought bankruptcy protection in 2008 during the financial crisis. The airline had struggled with high fuel costs and intense competition from United and Southwest at the Denver airport. Frontier emerged from restructuring a year later and was acquired in 2013 by an affiliate of Indigo Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in ultra-low-cost airlines. Indigo has previously invested in and advised Spirit Airlines, Tigerair in Singapore, Volaris in Mexico and Wizz Air in Europe. .Like those companies, Frontier focuses intently on keeping costs low and passing those savings onto customers, sometimes offering fares so cheap that they can attract customers who weren’t otherwise planning to travel. .“They’re not in the same business as American, Delta and United,” said Michael Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, an aviation consulting and forecasting firm in Evergreen, Colo. “When they go into a market, their main competitor is Home Depot. They’re after getting savings out of the bank account.” .Under Indigo’s ownership, Frontier installed a new management team, including Mr. Biffle, and sharply cut costs by renegotiating contracts and outsourcing its call center, lost baggage services, catering and other functions. The airline found ways to use its planes on more flights and switched to bigger planes with seats packed closer together. The airline has 104 Airbus A320 planes in its relatively young fleet, and plans to add 156 more by the end of 2028. .In a securities filing, Frontier said it believed that it could lure millions of passengers over the coming decade. The airline expects demand to rise for short domestic trips as more people choose to work remotely. It believes it could profitably add as many as 518 routes between airports that it already uses but that are not currently served by an ultra-low-cost carrier. .“We just believe we’ve got more embedded growth, we’ve also got lower costs, and we believe we’ve got a great brand that positions us well in the low-fare space,” Mr. Biffle said. .The airline claims it is unique among low-cost airlines. While Spirit tends to serve more-crowded markets and Allegiant Air less-crowded ones, Frontier is more evenly distributed. The airline said it kept planes moving for more hours every day than most other major airlines and offers some flights only a few days a week, allowing it to serve smaller cities. In addition to Denver, Frontier has a big presence in Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas. .Frontier also claims to be more fuel-efficient than its peers, which it hopes will appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. .The airline earned $251 million in 2019 before losing nearly as much last year. It has about $1 billion in cash or cash equivalents and employs about 5,000 people. .Deregulation of the U.S. airline industry in 1978 paved the way for the growth of low-cost carriers, which tend to operate direct, point-to-point flights, often to secondary airports in major cities — an approach pioneered by Southwest. That strategy makes it easier to put planes and crews to efficient use, allowing the airlines to offer relatively low fares. The more traditional hub-and-spoke model used by American, United and Delta is more expensive to maintain but easier to grow once established. .The ultra-low-cost model is a more recent creation, one that Europe’s Ryanair is often credited with popularizing. Companies that use it are much more aggressive about keeping costs low and maximizing revenue. These airlines tend to use their planes an hour or two more each day than other airlines and tend to cram more and smaller seats into planes. They also charge for lots of services that even many conventional discount airlines include in the ticket price, such as seat selection or printed boarding passes. .But larger airlines are unlikely to easily cede ground to Frontier and its ilk. In March, for example, United, which operates the most flights at the Denver airport, announced plans to add dozens of nonstop flights between small Midwestern cities and a handful of tourist destinations. Even before the pandemic, United and other large airlines were copying ultra-low-cost companies by offering lower fares and charging for more services.",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/business/frontier-airlines-ipo.html

13,House Hunting in England: Nestled in a London Viaduct for $1.3 Million,"This arched two-bedroom, two-bath house is built below and beside an active 19th-century railway viaduct in South London. The open-plan home, covering 1,600 square feet, is wrapped in a rust-colored steel shell and brings in light through a slender three-story atrium. .The front door, clad in palm wood and topped with a square window, sits in an underpass below the viaduct. A two-door entrance hall acts as a physical and acoustic buffer between inside and outside, said Didier Ryan, the architect, who designed the home for his brother, completing it in 2012. .“When you come through the second door, it opens up into the vast, cavernous space of the arch,” Mr. Ryan said. “It’s such a big scale change that it’s an amazing surprise for people to come through that space.” .He added, “London a good percentage of the time has very gray skies, but in that space it’s perpetually very softly well lit.” .To prevent noise and vibrations from the passing trains above, the house was set on an elevated rubber foundation and constructed with layered materials — including its industrial steel shell — and cavities that act as sound buffers, much like double-pane windows. .Both ends of the ground floor — which is large enough for several groupings of furniture, including two long kitchen tables — are framed by a wide arch. On one side, near the entrance, a staircase leads to a small mezzanine with a built-in bookcase and enough room for a children’s playroom or office. Beneath it, behind a door, is the laundry room. .On the opposite side, where the ceiling opens up into the soaring atrium, is the kitchen, with an island and cabinetry that curves with the wall. Countertops, like the built-in bookshelf and the mezzanine stairs across the way, are reclaimed iroko wood. A tall wood-framed kitchen window looks out to some planted greenery. .A bedroom is to one side of the kitchen, and a bathroom with a cavelike, mosaic-tiled shower is on the other. A spiral staircase leads up to another mezzanine with the second bedroom on one end and a bathroom on the other. In between, a white staircase ascends to the top level, which has been used as a study and offers skylight views. .The home is situated in London’s Walworth neighborhood, steps from the 140-acre Burgess Park and from the South Bank area, home to several arts venues and a riverside walkway. Two London Underground stations are within a mile of the house. Heathrow Airport is about an hour by car, or 75 minutes by public transit. .Britain’s housing market had a surprisingly robust 2020 despite the country’s  .. Even with a slight slowdown in January owing largely to a winter surge of coronavirus infections, the momentum has continued in 2021 thanks to low interest rates, the extension of government housing and job support, and the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, not to mention continued demand for larger homes and more outdoor space. .“I think the light at the end of the tunnel is certainly a great driver at the moment, and that’s another reason I think that the market is going to be very busy past Easter,” said James Klonaris, head of appraisals at The Modern House brokerage, which has this listing. “I think it’s all a question of staving off joblessness. If we can do that, I think the market will continue. And the pandemic has taught us that our living environments are hugely important.” .The Modern House ended 2020 with “probably the busiest market since 2015,” Mr. Klonaris said. A sales adviser at the brokerage, Jack Blythman, noted that the company has seen a 150 percent increase in website users since the start of 2021, compared with the same period in 2020. .After an eight-week pause during Britain’s first lockdown last spring, the market picked up quickly and barreled into Christmas. .“I don’t think any of us expected to come out the other side with such a strong market,” said Jonathan Hewlett, head of London residential at Savills. The global property firm reported a 10 percent growth in its British residential revenues from midyear 2020. .According to a  . (ONS), Britain saw its largest rate of annual house price growth since October 2014, with average house prices rising by 8.5 percent during the year and settling at a record high of 252,000 pounds ($347,000). The office’s  . showed the average at 249,000 pounds ($343,000), with prices also up in Wales (+9.6 percent), Scotland (+6.9 percent) and Northern Ireland (+5.3 percent). .London remained the most expensive area in Britain, with an average home price of 501,000 pounds ($691,000). .The December ONS report noted a “range of factors” for the increases, including reduced inventory, pent-up demand, shifting housing preferences amid the pandemic, and changes made to property transaction taxes. In July, the government placed the stamp duty land tax, a transaction tax paid on property purchases, on “holiday” through March 31, 2021. It has since been extended through June. .“We saw, obviously, the fairly well-established pattern now of people searching for more greenery and more space after the lockdown,” said Tom Bill, head of U.K. residential research at the property firm Knight Frank. “That certainly drove demand and drove activity to outer areas of London, the suburbs and also into the country.” .In prime central London, Savills also reported robust activity at the “absolute top end” of the market, Mr. Hewlett said. .Agents agreed that the greatest demand has been for large family houses with offices and outdoor space. However, travel restrictions prolonged by Britain’s spike in Covid-19 infections over the winter have forced foreign buyers out of the picture for the most part. .“Even with travel restrictions and very, very few international purchasers being in London, some international investors are certainly looking at buying off-plan units in new schemes,” Mr. Hewlett said, noting that the looming introduction of a 2 percent surcharge for overseas buyers on purchases of residential property is hastening activity. .Still, uncertainty over when foreign buyers will return to London is tamping down optimism for 2021, Mr. Bill said. “It might take a period of time to adjust,” he said, “so we’ve just reduced our forecast down for this year. We actually bumped it up a little bit for next year. We think demand is going to be probably displaced more into 2022.” .The hope is that the country is “on the verge of a sort of return to normality,” he said. “I think because the Covid cases are falling, because the vaccine program in the U.K. has been, relatively speaking, a success, because there is the prospect of summer holidays, I think what is happening now, we are starting to see supply come back in. And I think supply and demand are both, frankly, just getting stronger and stronger.” .Travel restrictions have altered the market’s demographics in Britain. “Usually we have quite a lot of American or European buyers, but that’s been less the case, unless they are domiciled,” Mr. Klonaris said. .In 2020, French buyers were the most prominent foreign presence in the central London market, “because they could get here more easily,” Mr. Bill said, noting that “Italians were fairly active as well.” .Before the pandemic, Chinese buyers dominated in prime Central London, followed by buyers from the U.S., Russia, India, Hong Kong and the Middle East. .There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in England. Buyers and sellers use their own lawyers, and the seller pays the agent’s commissions, which is 2 to 3 percent. .If the property is a second home, a 3 percent surcharge is added. This is in addition to the 2 percent stamp duty surcharge for overseas buyers, which is slated to be introduced April 1. .“We believe there are still plenty of international purchasers out there wanting to live/invest in London, and many genuinely believe that they are buying as close to the bottom of the market as you can,” Mr. Hewlett said. “Especially as buyers are getting a discount of circa 20 percent from the peak in 2014.” .This property is for sale on a leasehold.

14,Tiger Woods Update: Sheriff Says Crash Investigation Is Done,"The investigation into Tiger Woods’s single-vehicle crash in February is finished, but the results cannot be released publicly until Woods gives permission, the Los Angeles County sheriff said in a Facebook Livestream on Wednesday. .“A cause has been determined,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva said, adding: “We have all the contents of the black box. We’ve got everything completed, signed, sealed and delivered. However, we can’t release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision.” .Woods, 45, sustained severe injuries to his right leg on Feb. 23, requiring at least two operations after the S.U.V. he was driving crashed onto a hillside along a tricky stretch of road in Los Angeles County. No one but Woods, the pre-eminent figure in golf over the past quarter-century, was involved, according to the authorities. .The sheriff has maintained that the crash was an accident, saying that he and his deputies did not detect signs of impairment at the scene that day. However, he said about a week later that investigators had gotten a search warrant for the event data recorder, also known as a black box, in Woods’s S.U.V. to help clarify the cause of the crash. .“It’s still an accident,” he said Wednesday. “You have an accident, and you have deliberate acts. It’s an accident, OK. We’re reaching out to Tiger Woods to be able to release the report itself, and nothing has changed from what we know and what we learned throughout the course of the investigation. And everything we did turned out to be accurate.” .Woods’s longtime agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. .Here is what we know as of Wednesday night. .Woods was released last month from a Los Angeles hospital where he was treated after the crash, according to a post to his Twitter account on March 16 that said he was at home. .“I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day,” the Twitter post on Tuesday read. .Woods’s only known residence is in Jupiter Island, Fla., where he lives in a mansion — sometimes with his two children, custody of whom he shares with his ex-wife. .The post did not contain updates on his condition, and Steinberg, Woods’s agent, said in an email that he could not offer any further information on his client’s location or condition. .Woods was taken to Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles on the day of the crash and underwent emergency surgery to repair serious injuries to his right leg. .He was  . Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of Feb. 25. .The morning after Woods’s arrival at Cedars-Sinai, he received “follow-up procedures on his injuries,” which were deemed successful, according to a statement from Woods’s Twitter account. .Dr. Anish Mahajan, the acting chief executive of Harbor-U.C.L.A., said  . the night after the crash that both bones in Woods’s lower right leg, the tibia and the fibula, had been broken in multiple places and were “open fractures,” meaning the bones had pierced his skin. .Dr. Mahajan said doctors had “stabilized” the breaks by placing a rod in the tibia. He said that additional bones in Woods’s ankle and foot had also been injured and that they had been “stabilized with a combination of screws and pins.” .The statement did not describe any injuries to Woods’s left leg, though Daryl L. Osby, the Los Angeles County fire chief, had said earlier that Woods had “serious injuries” to both legs. The chief did not explain further and said he was not sure what other injuries Woods might have sustained. .Doctors not involved in Woods’s care have predicted an  . from his injuries. .The warrant to inspect the black box’s data was executed on March 1 as part of a “routine procedure,” a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department said last month. .When asked why the department had not sought a warrant for blood samples from the hospital, which would indicate whether Woods had alcohol or drugs in his system, Sheriff Villanueva said in a livestream on March 3 that there was no evidence of impairment. .“Absent the evidence of impairment, you know, you’re not going to get a search warrant,” the sheriff said. “Period. It’s not getting assigned by the judge.” .Though the investigation continued, Sheriff Villanueva was quite clear at a news conference on Feb. 24 that he believed the crash was accidental. “We don’t contemplate any charges whatsoever in this crash,” he said. “This remains an accident, and an accident is not a crime.” .Drug recognition experts — police officers trained to identify people suspected of being impaired — were not dispatched to either the site of the crash or the hospital, Sheriff Villanueva added. .Although Woods appeared “lucid and calm” immediately after the accident and was able to answer questions from Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, the first emergency responder to arrive at the scene, he “had no recollection of the crash itself” when asked at the hospital, Villanueva said in a Feb. 24  .. .Forensic experts from across the country who are not involved in the investigation told USA Today, for an  . published on March 13, that it appeared to be either a case of falling asleep at the wheel or of impaired or distracted driving. .The crash occurred on Hawthorne Boulevard near Rancho Palos Verdes, a coastal city of about 42,000 people in Los Angeles County. .According to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department, there were 13 accidents, four with injuries, from Jan. 3, 2020, to Feb. 23 of this year within a 1.35-mile stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard that includes the site where Woods crashed, according to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department. .Only one of those accidents was officially determined to have involved a person under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to the data, and none involved someone using a phone. Two of the 13 accidents were single-vehicle crashes, and the data indicated that neither driver in those cases had been driving under the influence. .The speed limit there is 45 miles per hour, but Deputy Gonzalez said he had sometimes seen vehicles going more than 80 miles per hour. Sheriff Villanueva said it appeared that Woods had been driving at a “greater speed than normal” on the day of the accident. .Officers arrived at the scene six minutes after receiving a 911 call and found Woods trapped in an S.U.V. that had rolled over, Sheriff Villanueva said on the day of the crash. .The vehicle Woods was driving hit the median strip, traveled several hundred feet and rolled several times before stopping in the brush on the other side of the road, Sheriff Villanueva said. There were no skid or swerve marks, indicating that Woods had made no attempt to brake, the sheriff said. The bumper and the front end of the car were “destroyed,” but the interior cabin of the vehicle was “more or less intact,” he added. .There was no evidence that Woods was being followed or looking at his phone, the sheriff said at the time of the crash. Weather was also not a factor in the crash, he said. Woods was wearing his seatbelt, and airbags in the car deployed, Deputy Gonzalez said. .Woods was in Southern California to host, but not to compete in, the Genesis Invitational at the Riviera Country Club in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles the weekend before the crash. Genesis Motor is a luxury vehicle division of Hyundai. Woods was in a 2021 Genesis GV80 S.U.V., which was provided to him during the tournament; he is  . in a courtesy car at tournaments. .Woods stayed after the weekend to do  ., and when the crash happened, according to ESPN, he was on his way to a photo shoot with the N.F.L. quarterbacks Drew Brees and Justin Herbert. .Rory McIlroy, 31, in an  .” with Jimmy Fallon on March 9, said that he had spoken with Woods and that he expected him to be able to recover at home with his family soon. .“He’s doing better — and I think all of us are wishing him a speedy recovery at this point,” McIlroy said of himself and unspecified fellow golfers in the interview, which he did from the Players Championship. .Several PGA Tour players  ., on the final day of the Workday Championship on Feb. 28.

On Sunday, he said he was “feeling fine, a little bit stiff,” and was awaiting another magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate his progress. .In the meantime, he said, he was “still doing the mundane stuff that you have to do for rehab, the little things before you can start gravitating toward something a little more.” .Woods tied for 38th place in the 2020 Masters, which was played in November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

15,The T List: Five Things We Recommend This Week,"visit This .Friday will see the opening of a new kind of general store in downtown New York, one informed by nostalgia and empathy as much as function. The fashion stylist Beverly Nguyen’s first foray into retail, the two-month pop-up shop Beverly’s NYC, will offer a tightly edited, affordable selection of household essentials — including the perfect martini glass, pepper mill and cast-iron pan, as well as olive oil she produced in collaboration with a family-owned company in Santa Ynez, Calif. — in a Chinatown space that conjures the same feelings of warmth and intimacy as the dinner parties that, before the pandemic, she threw regularly at her Manhattan apartment. The interior was a collaboration between Nguyen and two of her close friends, the architect Louis Rambert, known for his work with the firm  ., and the film producer Kelly McGee (Nguyen’s partner in the project), and .features floral wallpaper by the New York-based  ., as well as a custom kidney-shaped ceramic cash wrap by Fefo Studio in Brooklyn. But Nguyen’s biggest influence was perhaps her grandmother, who owned a hardware store in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, in the 1960s; it was only after praying to her spirit, when a previous location fell through, that Nguyen secured the venue. Her family is also represented in a line of simple, supersoft towels and table linens that Nguyen developed with her parents, Vietnamese immigrants who began manufacturing apparel after arriving in the States as refugees in the 1980s. She hopes the space, which was previously a Chinese temple, will feel equally welcoming to her Chinese neighbors, many of whom have lived in the neighborhood for decades, and to newcomers to the city looking to make a home here. As she sees it, “the shop is really for anyone who wants to build their own conversation and their own community.”  .eat This .For anyone wanting .to eat more sustainably and mindfully, the discovery of Pyscis, a gourmet tinned-fish company from Vienna, will be a welcome .one. Created by Marwan Saba, the .owner of Hans Reh, a local grocer that specializes in fish conserves, and his daughter, Song-I Saba, Pyscis sells seasonal pelagic fish responsibly sourced from Spanish waters and packaged in limited quantities. Its .offerings include blue mussels, bullet tuna and two types of sardines, each tinned in a high-quality olive oil specifically chosen to pair well .with the fish. “None of the subspecies we use have been overfished,” Song-I explains of the brand’s sustainability efforts. “These fish, like with the bullet tuna, .are lesser known in the industry, but they’re actually healthier: Because they’re younger, they don’t accumulate as many toxins.” Each tin comes wrapped in white parchment paper adorned with a drawing of the fish inside and held together by a natural-rubber band. While methods of preserving nonrefrigerated foods have remained largely unchanged since 1809, when Napoleon awarded .Nicolas Appert — known as the Father of Canning — 12,000 francs for winning a contest to find the best method of storing rations for his troops, Pyscis’s subtle touches are what make each tin .uniquely delicious. On a recent cold .night, I rolled back the lids on the sardines, the hand-shucked mussels and the tuna. I made a quick salad, softened some butter and ripped apart some good bread. I wasn’t feeding an army, but as I assembled tartine after tartine, I felt my resolve .return — at least for the evening.  .see This .In the folklore of suburban girlhood, the mall persists as a symbol of freedom and fantasy. Or so believes the multimedia artist  ., whose latest installation, “Daytime Sparkles,” debuts at  . this week in partnership with the Whitney .Museum’s emerging artists program. Lee, who grew up visiting her mother after school at the New Jersey department store where she worked, describes her time in these spaces as being dominated by pop music, ever-changing displays and shop-specific fragrances. For her installation, she drew on those memories, as well as her own Y2K .girl-power style and the 1996 .DJ Screw mixtape “Ballin in da Mall,” to create a piece that speaks to .teenage self-discovery and independence. Located on the fifth floor of Nordstrom’s New York flagship, on West 57th Street, the work includes two rust-colored couches that frame a low table, within which Lee has stored a range of Nordstrom merchandise, and atop which sit two analog televisions playing D.I.Y.-style commercials .that the artist filmed herself. The high white walls that surround the scene are adorned with sparkling shapes, colorful LED-lit windows, “No Loitering” signs and a massive projection of a candelabra dripping in necklaces, while a custom pop song that Lee created in collaboration with the composer and artist Stefan Tcherepnin .plays in the background. Shoppers are meant to engage with the installation — to recline on the sofas, bop their heads to the music — becoming one with the artwork and .showcasing precisely what Lee is nostalgic for: a public gathering place, where the younger versions of ourselves can run free.  .wear This .Born in the Mexican state of Jalisco, the artist  . left for California in 1925 to work on the railroads and in the mines. When the Great Depression hit, Ramírez, who didn’t speak English, found himself without a job or housing, and was picked up by the police and admitted against his will to a state hospital; he was eventually diagnosed with .catatonic schizophrenia. He would spend the last 30 years of his life in psychiatric facilities, where he kept to himself but produced a body of drawings that incorporated images of Catholic saints, cowboys and train tracks, as well as complex geometries. Since his death in 1963, he’s been widely recognized as a self-taught master and has been made the subject of various major museum shows. Now, he’s being celebrated by the French fashion label Lemaire, which, having partnered with the artist’s estate, sent cotton-linen, dry silk and cotton voile garments printed with Ramírez’s work down the (virtual) runway last fall. Sarah-Linh Tran, the co-creative director of the house, says that the artist’s tragic story resonates with our time, but it isn’t what she sees first: “What’s striking is that he had the power to transcend isolation and create an intimate topography.” And surely the works’ earthy tones and precise draftsmanship were a natural fit for Lemaire’s aesthetic. The brand honored the latter by eschewing a copy-and-paste approach and instead allowing Ramírez’s vivid line work to inform the silhouette of each piece, as with a shirt with an askew button that seems to create a step for the subjects of “Horse and Rider” (1953), heightening the sense that they are on the move. Tran’s favorite design is a parachute dress emblazoned with a Mexican Madonna. “It’s as though she’s playing hide-and-seek around the wearer’s body,” she says.  .Try This ., a Philadelphia-based creative studio founded in 2012 by Paul Farber and Ken Lum to facilitate the community’s engagement with public art through exhibitions and research initiatives, recently launched a free augmented reality app: OverTime. Developed in collaboration with the production company .Dream Syndicate and supported by the Knight Foundation, the software allows users to embark on free historical tours of the city. The app’s inaugural journey begins on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and is led by the local poet and activist Ursula Rucker. Scan the ground with your smart device and Rucker appears onscreen, welcoming you to Philadelphia. From there, users choose from three different tour options: There’s the virtual Living Timeline, which moves users from 10,000 years before the Common Era to 2021; City Sightlines, which maps Philadelphia’s development from an early “green country town” to a thriving city; and Statue Stories, which delves into the history of the Rocky Balboa statue and other memorialized figures. Each route enables participants to explore the hidden narratives underfoot, like the fact that the museum’s steps — and part of the building itself — were designed by the African-American architect Julian Abele in the early 20th century, or that before the arrival of William Penn in 1682, the land was inhabited by the Lenape, the Indigenous people of the area. Throughout the tour, Rucker asks users to answer three questions: “What has happened here? What can you see from here? What does this statue mean to you?” Submitted through the app, the responses become, according to Farber and Lum, part of the city’s collective memory. It’s a gesture Rucker herself agrees with: “Should we even call them monuments anymore?” she says of public statues and institutions. “All of our memories matter. We are our own monuments.”  .From T’s Instagram",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/t-magazine/maggie-lee-nordstrom.html
16,,"A year into the pandemic, it’s easy to find yourself reminiscing about the past: bustling restaurants, sweaty spin classes, grocery shopping unburdened by face masks and cascades of adrenaline. You may even miss things you never thought you would, like your annoying co-workers or your long commute. .Yes, this is the definition of “taking things for granted” — so perhaps it’s not surprising that we’re all suddenly appreciating what’s no longer available. But it’s also evidence of a cognitive tendency we share to selectively remember the past as better than it was, especially when the present doesn’t feel so good. .As we look back on “the good old days,” we need to ask ourselves: Was the past actually as great as we remember it? And what can we learn from all these walks down memory lane? .Not exactly. But there’s a common misconception that memories are accurate records of the past, pristinely preserved in a mental filing cabinet. .“Memory doesn’t really work like that,” said Anne Wilson, a professor of psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University whose research broadly focuses on memory, time and identity. “We reconstruct what happened in the past on the basis of little bits and pieces of memory. We’re acting like archaeologists — picking up the pieces and putting them back together.” .This doesn’t mean we consciously distort or embellish our memories. But the process of retrieving memories is “highly reconstructive and prone to various biases,” said Daniel Schacter, a professor of psychology at Harvard University and the author of “The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers.” .For instance, researchers have observed that memories associated with negative emotions fade more quickly than those associated with positive emotions. This phenomenon is known as fading affect bias. .“It’s a coping mechanism,” said Felipe de Brigard, a professor of philosophy, psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, who studies the intersection of memory and imagination. “You have to carry your past with you. If a memory hurt every time that you recalled it as much as when you experienced it, that would be unbearable.” . found a correlation between fading affect bias and perseverance, suggesting that diminished negativity allows people “to put positive and negative events into the proper emotional perspective.” .Then there’s the simple fact that most of us prefer reminiscing about positive experiences, which gives us “preferential access” to those memories, Dr. Schacter explained. In other words, aspects of the past that we enjoy thinking about tend to stick with us over time, while elements we don’t think about fade away. Researchers call this  .. “This may contribute to a positive memory bias because we tend not to rehearse, rehash and retrieve negative experiences,” Dr. Schacter added. Traumatic memories, which are often intrusive and persistent, are the notable exception. .Our general tendency to recall positive memories over negative ones is especially pronounced when we feel discomfort in the present. That’s because the process of recalling the past is always dictated by “the perspective that we’re coming in with and the questions we’re asking about the past,” Dr. Wilson said. She called this our “current lens.” .Your current lens acts as a kind of filter, determining what details you dredge up and what you make of them. Living amid a deadly pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we’re all primed with some degree of collective nostalgia as a baseline. “If we start out with the hypothesis that things were better in the past, then we’ll pull out memories to confirm that,” Dr. Wilson said. .Part of this has to do with what researchers call “mood repair” — doing what we can to lift ourselves up when we’re feeling down. “Memory isn’t just there to help us remember where the car is parked,” Dr. de Brigard said. “It also plays other roles, and one of them is to help us feel better.” .None of this is incidental — autobiographical memory has evolved this way for good reason. .In her  ., Dr. Wilson found that we manipulate our personal memories to create a coherent identity and favorable sense of self over time. .This may mean embellishing our memories with imaginative elements, or omitting details we’d rather not dwell on. “We know that memory and imagination interact enormously,” Dr. de Brigard said. “We often imagine ways in which the past could’ve happened. Then our imagination penetrates the original memory and modifies the content.” .While the malleable quality of our memory makes it vulnerable to manipulation, and error, it’s also a real adaptation of the human mind. “Recalling past positive events is an adaptive way to regulate emotion in the present and enhance optimism about the future,” Dr. Schacter said. .In fact,  . has shown that, on both neural and cognitive levels, the same regions of the brain come online when we remember the past as when we imagine the future. .It makes sense. To plan for the future, we have to look to the past. In less-than-ideal times, we may recruit positive memories in order to envision the future with greater hope, motivation and resilience. .No, chatting by the water cooler with colleagues may not have felt that extraordinary at the time. But glorifying experiences like these in our current moment may actually serve a purpose. Who among us doesn’t need a boost these days? .Just because memories  . change when we reconstruct them doesn’t necessarily mean all of them  . changed significantly. But it does mean that they are still all shaped by various cognitive processes, including those meaningful moments, like holiday gatherings or trips. .We’ve all felt it: The family vacation was full of arguments, sunburns and hangovers, but somehow you remember only the quality time, gorgeous weather and delicious meals. ., two psychology researchers, Terence Mitchell and Leigh Thompson, sought to offer and test a theoretical model for this phenomenon, which they called “rosy retrospection.” In their paper, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Thompson explained rosy retrospection as one of three ways our mind creates the effect of “rose-colored glasses.” First is rosy projection — the “great, positive anticipation” that often leads to “overblown expectations,” said Dr. Thompson, a professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. .Second, the researchers said, is the “dampening” of pleasure in the present: “We are hard-wired to give negative stimuli a lot more cognitive attention in the present,” Dr. Thompson said. But these details “disappear by the wayside in our memories.” The result? Rosy retrospection: recalling the past more fondly than we experienced it at the time. .Multiple studies document rosy retrospection in action. A  . found that visitors to Disneyland reported significantly more positive recollections of their trips than the details they reported during the trips themselves (like crying children or long lines). “We are hard-wired to give negative stimuli a lot more cognitive attention in the present,” Dr. Thompson said. ., Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Thompson found similar results when they put their theory of rosy retrospection to work, examining participants’ anticipation of, experiences in and recollections of a trip to Europe, a Thanksgiving vacation and a three-week cycling trip in California. Across the board, reported recollections were far more positive than experiences recorded in the present. .Put simply, we’ll always grab onto the details that confirm our current lens (“What a great vacation that was!”) and stitch together our memories accordingly. .“Part of this is driven by self-enhancement: ‘I want to think of myself as a lucky, fortunate, probably somewhat talented, capable person,’” .said Dr. Thompson. “We construct a story after the fact and selectively choose the things that were romantic.” .There is no glaring problem with romanticizing the past. As long as we’re aware how memory works, we can keep ourselves accountable, try to learn from the past and live more fully in the present. .But particularly during challenging moments of life, there are real benefits to taking a step back from whatever is going on in the present. .“We have the ability to get some space from our own experiences, which can be really useful for helping us think about them more objectively,” said Ethan Kross, a psychologist and the director of the University of Michigan Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory. .Dr. Kross has dedicated much of his research to studying what he’s called “self-distancing” — “the ability to step outside yourself and view yourself from a more distanced perspective, similar to how we might think of another person.” .He added: “There are lots of ways you can gain distance from your experiences. The act of thinking about the past is one way.” .Looking back at the past, romanticized or not, “allows us to get a broader sense of perspective, which can help people make sense of their experience,” he said. .A  . found that “temporal distancing” (or, thinking about ourselves in the past or future) enhances our ability to cope with negative events by helping us realize their impermanence: “This too shall pass,” an idea we’re better prepared to believe when we see the proverbial bigger picture. .Self-distancing has also been shown to  . and  ., support  ., and  . and  ., among other benefits. .Spending time with glorified memories in particular may also have  .. .“Nostalgia is an important psychological resource,” Dr. Wilson said. “People can dip into the past, especially when the present is not sustaining them.” . backs this up. Reaching for nostalgia has been shown to  . and  .. Research by Xinyue Zhou of Sun Yat-Sen University in southern China has shown that nostalgia not only has psychological benefits, but potentially also physiological ones. In  ., Dr. Zhou found that people experienced nostalgia more readily on cold days or in cold rooms; in addition, participants who engaged with nostalgic memories reported feeling warmer. .If nostalgia “warms” not only our hearts but also our bodies in the face of difficult conditions, then thinking fondly about the past may have evolutionary utility beyond emotional comfort. .The question, then, isn’t how do we appreciate the past less — but how do we learn to appreciate the present more? .Because of the pandemic, we now have evidence that we get nostalgic about even the most boring aspects of life. So, flip your mind’s own logic on its head, and consider what elements of your present situation, however dull and repetitive, you’ll reminisce about once all this is over. .Maybe it’s the bread you learned to make — and the ritual of making it. Perhaps it’s spending more time at home with your children. Allow yourself to really notice the details about these experiences in order to give more texture to your future memories. “Try to become nostalgic for the present,” Dr. de Brigard said. “Help your future self by making the present more memorable. Embellish the dullness.” .It may help to snap a few photos and make your seemingly mundane moments into memories worth keeping and revisiting. By thinking about your present experience in terms of its memory-potential, you may even find yourself paying more attention to the rosier moments rather than those “dampening” distractions. “I guarantee you won’t photograph your dog who keeps soiling the carpet, but you will photograph the perfect croque-madame that you have perfected during lockdown,” Dr. Thompson said. .It seems as if everywhere we look, we’re told to “be present.” It’s valid advice: Doing things like meditating or going for a walk can help us connect more directly to our experience and let go of mental chatter. .But immersing ourselves in the present isn’t the only way to appreciate life more. In fact, embracing our capacity to think about the past and future can help us develop a healthier perspective and find more meaning in the present. .“We’re constantly trying to make meaning out of our experiences, and our mind is flexibly constructed to help us do so,” Dr. Kross said. “I wouldn’t want to give up this ability to go back in time to make sense of what I’m experiencing and then create a story that propels me forward.” .So, take a step back from the nitty-gritty details of your life right now and consider how this period might fit into your “life story.” It will feel cliché, but giving yourself a bit of distance from the day-to-day will help you see yourself more clearly — and with greater compassion. Imagine yourself in the future thinking back on this time. What’s the story you will tell? What did you learn? How did you grow? .Before the pandemic, we gathered with friends, went to bars, saw live music and didn’t think anything of it. Now, you might notice yourself savoring small pleasures a bit more, especially if those things weren’t available during the earlier months of the pandemic. .It’s not a coincidence:  . have shown that when we have less, we savor more. “It’s an economic principle,” said Jordi Quoidbach, a psychologist and an associate professor of people management and organization at the Escuela Superior de Administración y Dirección de Empresas in Spain. “What is rare tends to be cherished more than what is readily available.” .Even when life returns to normal and the simple pleasure of eating out at a restaurant, for example, becomes available, we can “deprive ourselves of the overabundance of pleasure,” Dr. Quoidbach said. “To prolong the excitement of going back to restaurants even when life gets back to normal, we can make it a treat and decide actively that we’re not going to eat out three times a week, but make Thursday a special night, or even the third Thursday of every month.” .When all else fails, consider the fact that this period of time, like any other, will be susceptible to the infinite distortions of memory. Your hair may be gray and your anxiety may be through the roof, but you can imagine the story you’ll rewrite when it comes time to romanticize the past once again.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/smarter-living/why-we-romanticize-the-past.html

Urban and rural communities, red and blue states, the coasts and the middle of the country: All are confronting weak and faltering infrastructure. .“It’s a dire need,” said Greg DiLoreto, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, which publishes an extensive report card on the subject every four years. .The 2020 report gave the country a grade of C-minus, a slight improvement after two decades of Ds. Far more needs to be done, Mr. DiLoreto said: “It’s a terrible report card to take home to your folks.” .Roadways and bridges are still in use decades after the end of their projected life spans. Sewer and water systems are aged and decaying. And a changing climate threatens to worsen old vulnerabilities and expose new ones. .In the broad contours of the plan released by the Biden administration, specific proposals and figures are given for some of these infrastructure needs. The plan, for instance, proposes an extra $115 billion to modernize bridges, highways and roads that are in “most critical need of repair.” But other projects, such as levee systems, are not explicitly mentioned, and it is unclear how they might factor into the proposal. .We took a look at seven examples of urgent infrastructure vulnerabilities across the country, ranging from specific projects to broader problems. .Connecting New York City to New Jersey .The 111-year-old tunnels used by commuter trains and Amtrak have deteriorated rapidly since Hurricane Sandy flooded them with salt water in 2012. .Officials in New York and New Jersey have beseeched federal officials for years to help build new tunnels, arguing that the failure of one could have a devastating economic impact far beyond the region. The Trump administration resisted their appeals. Riders have been  ., with similar problems affecting railways along the Northeast Corridor. .Passenger railways across the country have struggled with a lack of federal funding, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers report card, creating a repair backlog of $45.2 billion. The Biden administration says its plan would replace buses and rail cars and expand transit and rail into new communities; it is unclear how the Hudson River tunnels might be involved. .Crossing the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Ky. .President Barack Obama stood at the base of this bridge in 2011, describing legislation that would help improve it. In 2016, President Donald J. Trump also made assurances to replace the structure. .Yet the  .. Rusty and creaky, it has been listed as “functionally obsolete” in the federal bridge inventory since the 1990s, and it has a history of bottlenecks and crashes. .There is a $2.5 billion plan to fix the bridge and build a new one alongside it, but in Covington, Ky., some have expressed worries about the proposal. The mayor  . that it was an “existential threat,” citing the size of the proposed bridge (some traffic would still cross over the old one, as well). .Mr. Biden’s plan vows to fix the nation’s 10 most economically significant bridges but has not specified which ones those are. “If there is any project eligible, this would be it,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader,  . at a news conference on Wednesday. “Hopefully somewhere in the bowels of this multitrillion bill, there’s a solution.” .Puerto Rico .While children around the world have been going to school remotely since the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, many students in Puerto Rico had been out of class months earlier. That was because a school in southern Puerto Rico had crashed to pieces after  .. .The collapse brought attention to the more than 600 schools on the island that shared a “short column” architectural design, which makes them vulnerable to tremors. Teachers and parents were wary of reopening, and the schools with that design risk remain closed. Children who had gone to them are still learning remotely. .In addition, nearly 60 schools were closed after inspections following the earthquakes showed structural deficiencies. About 25 had “persistent” problems that predated the earthquake and its aftershocks, Puerto Rico’s education secretary told The New York Times last year. .Government officials recently acknowledged that in the year the schools were closed for the pandemic, no repairs had been made on any of the hundreds of vulnerable schools. .Across the country .Major bridges that carry tens of thousands of cars and eighteen-wheelers are not the only ones showing their age. So are smaller bridges in rural areas, which have much less traffic but are no less vital to a community’s ability to function. (In Mississippi alone, officials list 355 bridges that have been closed because of their age or dilapidation.) .Under the president’s infrastructure plan, 10,000 of these bridges would be fixed. .Of the nation’s bridges, 71 percent are rural. They make up 79 percent of the bridges rated as poor or structurally unsound, according to Trip, a transportation research nonprofit group. .Advocates for rural communities say the problems with bridges are indicative of a wider lack of connectivity — by roadways and through broadband internet. (The president’s plan also says it will deliver access to reliable high-speed internet to the 35 percent of residents of rural communities without it.) .Rural roads and bridges have a $211 billion backlog in improvements. Some of these projects, such as adding guardrails and widening lanes, could make it safer to drive on rural, noninterstate roads, which account for a disproportionately high number of the country’s traffic deaths. .Jackson, Miss. .Many vulnerabilities in infrastructure were exposed when a powerful winter storm swept through Texas and into the Southeast in February. One of them was the water system in Jackson, Miss., the state capital, where  .. .The water crisis inflamed enduring tensions in Jackson, ones that grip many communities where white residents have fled and tax bases have evaporated. The city has old and broken pipes. It does not have the funding to repair them. City officials estimated that modernizing Jackson’s water infrastructure could cost $2 billion. .The storm also caused power failures for millions of people across Texas, which has prompted lawmakers there to weigh an overhaul of the state’s electric infrastructure. At least  . as a result of the storm, according to state officials, and it also caused widespread property damage and left some residents to face huge electric bills. .Under Mr. Biden’s plan, lead pipes and service lines would be eliminated, and more transmission lines for electricity would be installed. .Michigan and many other states .When Michigan state officials investigated what had led to the collapse of the Edenville and Sanford dams last year, which caused thousands to evacuate and inundated hundreds of homes and businesses, the  .: A historic flooding event had caught up with years of underfunding and neglect. .The country has roughly 91,000 dams, a majority of which are more than 50 years old, and many are an exceptional rainfall away from potential disaster. As dams have aged, the weather  ., rendering old building standards outdated and creating conditions that few considered when many of the dams were built. .Residential development has also steadily spread into once rural areas that lie downstream from the weakening infrastructure. According to the  ., about 15,600 dams in the country would most likely cause death and extensive property damage if they failed. Of those, more than 2,330 are considered deficient, the group said. .While the Biden plan mentions “dam safety,” it gives no details. .Across the country .The country has tens of thousands of miles of levees, which safeguard millions of people and trillions of dollars’ worth of property. .The United States Army Corps of Engineers operates a small fraction of the nation’s levees, while the rest are maintained by a patchwork of levee districts, local governments and private owners. .But floodwaters care little about who is in charge of maintenance, as the catastrophic 2019 floods in the Midwest showed. When record-breaking rains fell, levees were breached or overtopped across the region, drenching farmland, inundating homes and causing billions of dollars in damage. .The rainfall  ., given new weather patterns driven by climate change. And some of the officials whose towns and cities were most affected by the 2019 floods are adamant: Simply refurbishing levees is not going to work anymore. .“Levees aren’t going to do it,” said Colin Wellenkamp, the executive director of Mississippi River Cities & Towns Initiative, an association of 100 mayors along the Mississippi River. His group presented a plan to the White House last month detailing a “systemic solution” to flooding. It includes replacing wetlands, reconnecting backwaters to the main river and opening up areas for natural flooding. .A plan that simply replaces infrastructure, rather than rethinking what it encompasses, will be ineffective and ultimately unaffordable, Mr. Wellenkamp said. He is not sure whether his group’s proposals have been folded into the Biden plan. But he sees little choice. .“This is a losing game unless we incorporate other, larger solutions,” he said. .Campbell Robertson . and  .Frances Robles . contributed reporting.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/infrastructure-projects-joe-biden.html
18,An Argument for Investing Where the Return Is Social Change,"Advocates for impact investments have long made the case that investments can do social good without sacrificing returns. .And then there are the wealthy philanthropists who give money to nonprofit organizations trying to bring about social change without expecting any financial return. .But there is a middle ground for investors — a little more impact for a little less return. It has been the third rail of socially responsible investing, though, mainly because impact investors fear that such an approach could embolden critics who have long warned that investors will get lower returns if they want to push for change. .Now, a new study by the Bridgespan Group, the philanthropic consulting arm of Bain & Company, argues that this is the moment to put more money, time and energy into a middle ground, which it calls impact-first investing. The  ., “Back to the Frontier: Investing That Puts Impact First,” focuses on investments that consider positive impact first and financial return second. It makes the case for how such investments can boost emerging technologies faster than grants or traditional impact investments. These investments, the report says, can help create new markets. .“It doesn’t have to be just return-seeking or just philanthropy,” said Michael Etzel, co-head of the impact investing practice at Bridgespan and the lead author of the report. “You can use that tool that sits in the middle.” .Mr. Etzel said he saw this approach as a way to speed up getting to a solution by backing new technologies or creating markets that could later support more traditional impact investments. .“Success is about the social and environmental impact you care about and getting to it faster rather than looking at your overall portfolio and net worth,.” he said. .One example of how this would work is the investment strategy of Ceniarth, which is focusing on using its funds to bring about major changes. Ceniarth, with $450 million, was set up by Diane Isenberg, whose wealth derives from Nabors Industries, the oil and gas drilling company created by her father, Eugene. Its impact-first investments are considered high risk without the commensurate rate of return for the risk being taken, though they are still likely to pay back something. .“Our segment is working on livelihoods in marginalized and vulnerable communities globally,” said Greg Neichin, the director of Ceniarth. “We’re trying to improve economic livelihoods by addressing issues of poverty around the world.” .One investment it made was in the One Acre Fund, which provides loans so small farmers in Africa can buy better seed and fertilizer and get agronomic training. .“When we think about the things for us that are successful, it’s a combination of delivering economic benefit to recipients and having the capacity to scale an idea,” Mr. Neichin said. .Credit for devising this middle ground often goes to the Omidyar Network, which the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, created as both a foundation and an impact investment firm. Matt Bannick, its former managing partner, said Mr. Omidyar had been hesitant at first to blur the lines. .Instead, Mr. Bannick said, they focused on creating new markets. One example was d.light, which provided solar-powered lanterns to replace more dangerous kerosene lanterns in Africa. .“We found when we loosened the constraint of financial returns, then the focus became even more about impact,” said Mr. Bannick, who is a co-author of the Bridgespan report. “If you’re getting 5 percent less on the return, then what are you going to get on the impact? Let’s be more explicit about the intended impact here.” .The middle-ground approach is not without critics. .One issue is that while the wealthy can take such risks for a low return, most investors cannot. Nor would investors in many of the typical impact funds be willing to accept lower returns for riskier investments. .Getting a market-rate return is something impact investors are comfortable with, but a lower return makes it harder to attract enough investors, said Trenton Allen, managing director and chief executive of Sustainable Capital Advisors. “It’s not impossible,” he said. “But you’re narrowing the number of investors you have access to.” .Traditional impact investors also argue that accepting different returns for different investments is already happening. Consider bondlike returns for fixed-income types of risk. .“Impact investing is a big tent and should be a big tent,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner at DBL Partners, an impact venture capital fund. “The challenge is, we shouldn’t muddy the waters and think impact-first is the only kind of investment. We also don’t want to step backward and deal with biases about returns that we have spent at least 10 years fighting.” .Even those who have taken the approach agree that it is a luxury. .“If the organizing priority is impact, that’s a privilege, but you have to have a deep tolerance for risk,” said Margot Kane, chief investment officer of Spring Point Partners, which is a social venture fund created by the Berwind family of Philadelphia, whose wealth dates to 19th-century coal mining. .For anyone considering taking the middle ground, here are the two key questions: How do you determine if an investment qualifies as impact first? And since impact, not return, is the primary motivation, how do you measure it? .Let’s start with selection. .“One of the things we ask ourselves when we’re doing due diligence on one of these projects is, ‘Is this a really great catalytic investment or a very bad market-rate investment?’” said Liesel Pritzker Simmons, co-founder and principal of Blue Haven Initiative and a member of the family whose wealth derives from Hyatt hotels. .“Honestly, it tends to come down to what is the problem they’re trying to solve and is the nature of that solution super-scalable or not?” she said. .Members of the Berwind family invested through Spring Point in a convertible bond from Greenprint Partners, which improves storm water drainage in low-income communities. .“They’re off to the races now, with more established lending partners now,” Ms. Kane said. “They graduated away from needing our support.” .That type of success is one measure of effectiveness. But it’s not always easy to measure the impact. .On climate issues, the accepted measurement is a ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent, said Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation Investment Management, the impact-investing fund that former Vice President Al Gore co-founded. .“With climate, you can measure how much is removed from the environment each year,” he said. “Beyond climate, the units of measurement aren’t as well accepted. How do you measure a unit of biodiversity? No one knows that. Something like education or poverty alleviation — there isn’t an accepted measurement.” .At family foundations, the measurement can be something the family determines before making the investment. “We take a fairly light touch,” Ms. Pritzker Simmons said. “We want to know what the return is and what are the top three impact key performance indicators. One extra dimension is we look at with a catalytic investment is: Did it do what it said it was going to do, and did it scale?” .Sometimes that is fairly apparent. An example: Pula is an organization that connects small farmers all over Africa with crop insurance and uses data to evaluate the yields from small farms so that crop insurers will write policies. .It’s now working with 1.7 million farmers across 13 countries on the continent; those farmers have insurance for $600 million in agricultural investments, like the purchase of seeds and fertilizers. .Rose Goslinga, co-chief executive and founder of Pula, said impact-first investment was what made the business possible. “Last year, we balanced the books,” she said. “Coming from a more traditional development background, I was happy we didn’t make a loss.”",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/your-money/impact-investing-social-change.html
19,,"Tesla said on Friday that it more than doubled the number of cars it delivered in the first quarter, bouncing back after the pandemic slowed sales in the same period a year ago. .The electric carmaker said it sold 184,8000 vehicles in the first three months of the year, up from 88,500 a year ago. It produced 180,338 vehicles, compared with 102,672 in the first quarter of 2020. .The company’s sales numbers, which cover the entire world, come a day after General Motors and Ford Motor  .. Tesla does not break out its sales by region and a lot of its recent growth has been in China, where electric cars make up a much larger share of the auto market than in the United States. .Tesla was helped by the arrival of the Model Y, a roomier version of its Model 3 sedan. Those two cars accounted for almost all of its deliveries in the first quarter. It reported just 2,020 deliveries of its high-end cars — the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle. .Tesla has halted production of the Model S and Model X while preparing its plant in Fremont, Calif., to build updated versions of the cars. The company said in a statement that it was “in the early stages of ramping production” of the new models, which generate much more profit than the Model 3 and Model Y. .The first-quarter sales numbers could lift Tesla shares, which have lost more than a quarter of their value since January when they hit a high of about $900. The impact won’t be known until next week, however, because the stock market is closed in observance of Good Friday. On Thursday, Tesla’s stock fell about 1 percent, closing at $661.75. .Analysts were surprised by the jump in sales.

20,Why the Markets Need a Strong Government Hand,"Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate, is said to have joked that if the federal government were put in charge of the Sahara, in five years there would be a shortage of sand. .That antigovernment attitude has been embraced by countless free-market enthusiasts. President Ronald Reagan  . it clearly in his first Inaugural Address: “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” For decades, this perspective has gained influence in American political discourse. .The resulting hostility to government has been costly. It helped spawn not just the recent Texas electric grid meltdown but also a long string of similar failures, including responses to Hurricane Katrina, the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis. .None of these challenges came without warning. A similar cold-induced grid failure had occurred in Texas in 2011, prompting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to warn that unless the state took steps to weatherproof its infrastructure, even more serious failures would be inevitable. Yet Texas not only failed to take those steps, it acted to  . from connecting to the national power grid, exempting them from federal regulation. .More serious challenges are in store. Referring to the lessons of the pandemic year, the novelist Ian McEwan  ., “Covid is our mass tutorial, our dress rehearsal for all the depredations as well as tragedies that the climate emergency could bring.” As David Wallace-Wells described in his  ., “The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming,” .the storms, droughts and wildfires of recent years offer only a hint of much bigger threats ahead. .The antigovernment movement is easily the biggest obstacle to society’s ability to parry those threats. It is therefore an opportune moment to scrutinize the economic arguments of government opponents in their own terms. .Many cite the Invisible Hand theory of the economist Adam Smith in support of their claim that unregulated markets harness the interests of self-interested individuals in the service of society as a whole. This is a remarkable claim, and Smith’s contribution was to identify conditions under which it might be expected to hold. But as Smith also understood clearly, individual and collective interests often diverge sharply. .That’s why most modern economists believe that societies function best when resources are allocated in part by private market forces and in part by collective guidance from government. But at one edge of the opinion spectrum lies an influential group of economists, many of them inspired by Mr. Friedman, who are hostile to almost any form of government involvement in economic life. .Many of their arguments appear rooted in a belief that government is inherently inefficient. There are bridges to nowhere and other vivid examples of government waste, to be sure. Yet detailed examination of local, state and federal government budgets reveals that the bulk of public spending goes for services that most citizens value. .More to the point, there is also substantial waste in the private sector, much of it caused by individual purchase decisions that impose costs on others. .Suppose, for example, that everyone owned a car weighing less than 2,500 pounds and someone then bought one that weighed 5,000 pounds. That person would face less risk of injury and death than before, while all others would face more. Their best response may be to buy 5,000-pound cars themselves, in which case everyone’s risk would be higher than when all were driving smaller cars. .Similarly, at crowded gatherings in enclosed spaces (remember them, before the pandemic?), when all speak more loudly to hear better, they don’t hear as well as they would have if all had spoken more softly. .In these cases, individually rational behavior is collectively irrational. Buying 5,000-pound cars when 2,500-pound cars would be better for almost everyone is waste, pure and simple. .Taxing vehicles by weight would be a relatively unintrusive remedy. But opponents of government might object, saying such measures are social engineering. Yes, but so are speed limits and traffic lights. Policies that try to bring individual and collective interests into closer alignment exist in all countries, for good reason. And as long as we have to tax something, why not tax activities that cause harm to others? Every dollar raised from such levies can be a dollar less from the many taxes currently imposed on beneficial activities. .Former President George W. Bush once said, “We don’t believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of Americans.” Yet that’s exactly what all societies entrust government bureaucrats to do, again for good reason: Even if people are just as rational and markets just as competitive as Mr. Friedman believed, individually rational actions often yield demonstrably bad outcomes.  .The government requires catalytic converters on cars, for instance, because each individual’s decision to install one would be costly and yield no measurable impact on air quality. Yet when everyone installs a catalytic converter, the benefit of the improvement in air quality far outweighs the corresponding cost. .Many in the antigovernment movement have objected that people’s liberties are unjustly curtailed by evidence-based public health regulations, as when state and local jurisdictions have imposed mask ordinances. .Measures to limit travel or attendance at sporting events, universities or workplaces to people who have been  . against the coronavirus arouse similarly intense pushback. But these steps, too, are grounded on the disjuncture between individual and collective interests: Avoiding vaccines and masks affects not just the individual but the multitude of others placed at greater risk of infection. .As John Stuart Mill, the celebrated champion of individual liberty,  ., “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” Without a preposterous claim that easily preventable deaths don’t constitute harm to others, it’s hard to argue that the pandemic restrictions fail Mill’s test. .Conflicts between individual and collective interests also motivate government interventions against both climate and financial instability. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions entails steps that may be costly to an individual but whose benefits accrue to billions of others. Similarly, a poorly justified loan may entail only small costs to the bank that issues it, but the collective consequences of such loans can be years of economic recession. .Free-market enthusiasts often insist, plausibly, that people spend their own money more carefully than any bureaucrat would. But that observation misses the larger point that individual and collective interests often fail to coincide. .Spending that promotes individual interests is, in fact, directly responsible for many of the greatest threats now facing society. And by a wide margin, the most formidable barrier to the collective action necessary to meet those threats is the belief that government is our biggest problem. .Robert H.

21,,"For months, Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, arguably the most powerful individual in the oil business, has urged his fellow producers to keep a tight rein on output, fearing additional crude could flood the world’s markets and cause prices to drop. At the same time, some producers, notably Russia, have been chafing to open the spigot a bit more. .On Thursday, the prince seemed to relent, as the group called OPEC Plus — the members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia — agreed to modest output increases over the next three months. .Analysts said the prince, who is the chair of OPEC Plus, appeared to be calculating that by appeasing other producers who want to produce more oil, he can remain in control over the longer term. .The prince repeated his go-slow message on Thursday, arguing that the global economic recovery from the pandemic remained fragile, and so his willingness to sign off on an increase came as something of a surprise. But the decision seemed to be an acknowledgment of the diversity of opinions within OPEC Plus, and that he must take the views of other key producers like Russia and the United Arab Emirates into account to maintain leadership and to keep them from going their own way. .“It is not my decision, it is everybody’s decision,” he said at a news conference after Thursday’s OPEC Plus meeting. .So far traders have signaled their approval by pushing up prices in what had been a weak market. On Friday, Brent crude, the international benchmark was up about 3.4 percent to $64.86 a barrel. .Under the deal agreed to on Thursday, OPEC Plus will gradually increase production by 350,000 barrels a day in May and June and 441,000 barrels a day in July. Over the same period, the Saudis will also relax the one million barrels a day they have been voluntarily keeping off the market, bringing the total increase to about 2.1 million barrels a day by July. .The plan “points to a still cautious and orderly ramp-up from OPEC Plus, still allowing for a tight oil market,” rather than a flood, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. .OPEC Plus also retain the option of adjusting output at monthly meetings. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, can also take unilateral decisions to trim supplies. .This ability to quickly backtrack “provides the prince with comfort that he is exercising a fairly low-risk option,” Helima Croft, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/saudi-arabia-opec-oil-prices.html
22,"China Puts Limits on Foreign Banks, Worrying Businesses","SHANGHAI — To defend against accusations by Washington and others that it doesn’t play fair on trade, Beijing could point to the banks. Chinese leaders have been  . they had erected around the country’s vast financial system, giving Wall Street and European lenders a greater shot at winning business in the world’s second-largest economy. .Now the walls are going up again. .New Chinese rules have sharply limited the ability of foreign banks to do business there, making them less competitive against local rivals, according to three people with knowledge of the directives. One set of rules enacted in December and January restricts how much money foreign banks can transfer into China from overseas. Another that took effect on Wednesday required many foreign banks to make fewer loans and sell off bonds and other investments, two of the people said. .The new rules have caused a stir among the global bank executives and foreign companies in China that depend on those lenders for money, the people said. Among other concerns, they worry that the rules could make foreign-owned businesses more dependent on China’s state-run banking system for the money they need to grow. That dependence could give Beijing another potential pressure point to use as it squares off against Washington and others over trade, human rights, geopolitics and other sticky issues. .Banks and trade groups have been reluctant to speak publicly for fear of triggering further regulatory measures. But in a January letter to China’s central bank that was reviewed by The New York Times, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China raised concerns about the money transfer limits. .“In some cases, the risk brought about by this major structural change may fundamentally overturn the strategic development direction of E.U. banks” in China, the letter said. .The new rules could complicate already thorny political issues, such as  ., a pending investment agreement between  . and long-simmering tensions over how Beijing  . of the Chinese currency. President Biden has  . in letting up on the trade demands pressed by his predecessor, Donald J. Trump. The two sides are also clashing over human rights, particularly Beijing’s  . in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang and its  .. .International companies have been caught in the middle. Over the past two weeks, Chinese state media and the country’s online community have  . like H&M, the Swedish retailer, and Nike, the American athletic brand, after they vowed not to use cotton made by forced labor in Xinjiang. .The reasons behind China’s new banking rules aren’t clear, though they appear to have little to do with the tense political environment. They seem to be aimed instead at stemming big, potentially disruptive flows of money into the country. .“I can understand how this is about protecting financial stability,” said Mark Sobel, a former United States Treasury official. “I can also understand how you could argue this is discriminating against foreign banks.” .The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank and the issuer of the rules, didn’t respond to requests for comment. .China, which keeps tight control over money flows in and out of the country, may be worried that a surge of funds into the country could lead to nasty surprises like inflation. Money poured into the country in the second half of last year as the Chinese economy threw off its pandemic doldrums while activity in much of the rest of the world shrank. .Measuring flows is difficult, but foreign investors last year increased their holdings of Chinese bonds by about $150 billion. China also  . by taking in $163 billion worth of direct investments in factories, office buildings, companies and other assets. .Big money flows into a country can also make its currency rise in value — and China appears to working hard to counter that. .China’s currency, the renminbi, rose sharply in value against the U.S. dollar in the second half of last year. In May, $1 was worth about 7.15 renminbi. By year’s end, $1 bought about 6.5 renminbi. That rise was bad news for China’s exporters because it made their goods less competitive overseas. .But since the Chinese government enacted its new banking rules, the currency has begun to weaken. It now stands at about 6.6 renminbi to the dollar. .The new rules alone aren’t likely significant enough to account for the sudden halt to the renminbi’s rise. But they join other moves made by the Chinese government in recent months that have made moving money into China slightly harder and moving it out slightly easier. Combined, they could put pressure on the renminbi to weaken. .“This has started since last October, and they are all on the same side,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University. .Outside factors have likely contributed to the renminbi’s shift, including the resurgence of the U.S. economy, which could lead investors to steer their money there instead. .Chinese officials have stressed in recent months that their country is open to foreign investment, particularly banking. .“The inflow of foreign capital is inevitable, but so far, the scale and speed are still within our control,” Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, which has worked closely with the central bank on the new policies, said during a news conference on March 2. “We continue to encourage foreign financial institutions to enter China for shared development.” .In an unsuccessful attempt to head off a trade war with the Trump administration, China gradually relaxed or removed limits on foreign banks, insurers and money management firms. Big banks responded by expanding their mainland operations, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. .The global financial environment has encouraged money flows into China. With near zero interest rates elsewhere, international banks borrowed cheaply abroad. Until the new rules kicked in, they could send that money to China and lend or invest it there, reaping higher returns. .The first of the new rules, issued in a memo to banks in December, appeared to be aimed at that trend. That rule limited the ability of global banks to raise money overseas and move it into China. The rule is being phased in through November but was written in a way that has already had a big effect on financial contracts involving bets on the renminbi’s direction, said the people familiar with the notice. .Another measure communicated directly by Chinese regulators to foreign banks three weeks ago concerned the size of bank balance sheets, two of the people said. .Concerned about the rapid growth of credit in the Chinese economy, regulators ordered domestic and foreign banks to limit their balance sheets by Wednesday night to show only slight growth from last year. Because China has recently loosened limits on foreign purchases of bonds, many foreign banks had been buying more bonds for sale to foreign customers, expanding their balance sheets. .The full impact of the new rules will depend on how long they stay in place. Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, predicted that China would eventually resume opening up to foreign financial institutions. .“They don’t want to scare off foreign investors in the medium to long term,” he said.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/china-foreign-banks.html
23,Pandemic Helps Stir Interest in Teaching Financial Literacy,"Two dozen state legislatures are considering bills on financial literacy education, an unusually high number, proponents say. .They attribute the interest to concern about the burden of student debt, as well as heightened awareness about income and economic inequality as a result of the pandemic. .“There’s a recognition that folks are being left behind,” said Tim Ranzetta, founder of Next Gen Personal Finance, a nonprofit group that creates free courses and funds training for high school teachers. Next Gen compiled  . of bills submitted for consideration in 25 states. It’s unclear how many will pass, Mr. Ranzetta said. .As of early 2020, high school students in 21 states were required to take a personal finance course to graduate, according to the  ., which promotes economic and personal finance education for students in kindergarten through high school. That was a net gain of four states since the council’s previous count two years earlier. .“We are making progress,” said Billy J. Hensley, president and chief executive of the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group that promotes effective financial education. .“I do think the pandemic is bringing more attention to the topic,” he said, noting that after the financial crisis more than a decade ago there was also a flurry of financial literacy proposals in state legislatures. .An increasing number of studies support the effectiveness of financial literacy education when taught by well-trained teachers, said Nan J.

And more teachers now say they feel confident teaching the material.  . released in March by researchers at the University of Wisconsin and Montana State University found significant increases in teacher participation in professional development. .Still, the rigor of high school financial education varies. Just six states require high school students to complete a semester-long, stand-alone personal finance course, the council’s 2020 report found. Some states permit shorter courses or include the content as part of another class. .In states that don’t require financial instruction, some schools opt to teach it and do an excellent job, but others ignore the subject completely — and they tend to be schools in less affluent districts, Mr. Hensley said. .In the latest round of legislative proposals, some states are merely encouraging the teaching of financial skills while a few would make the subject a graduation requirement. Ohio, for instance, is considering a proposal that would require high school students to pass a half-credit class in personal finance in order to graduate. The class must be taught by a teacher trained in the subject matter. .The bill would also create a fund to help pay for training to teach the subject, said State Senator Steve Wilson, a Republican and former banking executive who co-sponsored the bill. He said he was hopeful that the bill would be voted out of committee this month. .“Kids come out of school having no clue about financial literacy,” Senator Wilson said. “You go out into the world greatly disadvantaged.” .Many financial literacy advocates consider a full-semester course the gold standard for personal finance instruction. Rebecca Maxcy, director of the Financial Education Initiative at the University of Chicago, said many courses focused mainly on skills, like writing a check or filing taxes. While those lessons can be helpful, she said, it’s important for courses to include discussions of how personal values and attitudes about money influence behavior, as well as an examination of the financial systems and potential barriers that students will encounter in the world of money. .Questions like “Who benefits when you open a bank account?” can prompt meaningful discussions, she said. .Some curriculum options, however, offer more condensed, basic instruction. .Everfi, a digital instructional company, offers a free seven-session program for high school financial literacy. Students take interactive, self-guided lessons in topics like banking, budgeting and college financing. .Sidney Strause, a freshman at Marshall University in West Virginia, said she had taken Everfi’s course as a junior in high school. The lessons were assigned as part of another course she was taking, and typically took 45 minutes to an hour to complete. .“It taught me how to budget and save,” she said. “It’s crucial to adulthood.” Sometimes she would do the lessons at home and discuss them with her mother, she said, which led her mother to create a budget and set financial goals. .Several groups, including the Council on Economic Education, provide guidance on quality educational materials. The council publishes  . and benchmarks, the University of Chicago’s Financial Education Initiative has created  .of characteristics for “high quality” financial education, and the  ., a nonprofit group, maintains a list of educational programs. .Here are some questions and answers about financial literacy: .While results vary, recent studies suggest that “well-implemented” state education mandates lead to a “clear improvement in financial behaviors,” according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  . from the National Endowment for Financial Education, for instance, found that required financial education could help students make smarter decisions about paying for college. .Ms. Maxcy of the Financial Education Initiative said that talking with a parent or trusted adult about money issues could be a powerful learning tool for students, but that it was often difficult for parents to start conversations. The program’s research led to the creation of a deck of 105 “Talking Cents” cards that pose simple questions to start a discussion.

24,,"ENFIELD, Conn. — The bones of Brooks Brothers stores are scattered across 100,000 square feet here in a warehouse near the Massachusetts border, mixed in with a sea of cardboard boxes and junk. .There are legions of mannequins, empty circular tables that once displayed neckties, posters of horseback-riding gentlemen from a bygone era. There is a whole section of Christmas trees and countless gold-painted ornaments of sheep suspended by ribbon — a  . since 1850 known as the Golden Fleece. Blank order forms for tailors are strewn about. A neon sign that apparently still works. There is no apparel, but there are rows of heavy sewing machines that most likely came from one of the brand’s recently shuttered factories. And in the bathroom, a welcome carpet with Brooks Brothers written in cursive sits next to a toilet. .The whole mass was abandoned here in the fallout of Brooks Brothers’ bankruptcy filing and sale last year, the scraps of a retailer that made nearly $1 billion in sales in 2019. Ever since, the couple that owns the warehouse, Chip and Rosanna LaBonte, has been scrambling to figure out how to get rid of it all. Junk removal companies have told them it will cost at least $240,000 to clear the space, which Brooks Brothers had rented through November. In order to pay the bill, the LaBontes are going to have to sell their home. .The couple’s plight illustrates the far-reaching consequences of  ., which cascaded during the pandemic and affected everyone from factory workers to executives. Smaller vendors and landlords have often been left holding the  .during lengthy byzantine bankruptcy proceedings, particularly with limits on what they can spend on legal bills compared with larger corporations. And once bankrupt brands are sold, people like the LaBontes are typically left in the dust. .“It is a very sad situation that unfortunately does happen quite a bit because it is just part of the bankruptcy situation as the statute is drafted,” said James Van Horn, partner and retail bankruptcy specialist at Barnes & Thornburg. “Unfortunately, creditors can become victims, and sometimes they have little or no options to recover what is owed them.” .Retailers like Brooks Brothers were prominent among the more than 600  . in the United States last year, which had the highest number of filings in a decade, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. .The LaBontes, who are in their 60s, have been working with a liquidator to sell what they can of the Brooks Brothers detritus, and are about to list their home in Sherborn, Mass. While they have filed a claim in bankruptcy court, they are anticipating receiving less than 5 percent of what they are owed, if that — and confessed that the proceedings are hopelessly confusing. Most of all, they are angry and incredulous about the situation, especially as Brooks Brothers continues to operate under wealthy new owners. .“We understand going out of business and the bankruptcy, but to dump their problem on us and walk away from it and make us incur this cleanup cost?” Mr. LaBonte said in an interview in Enfield. “Nobody would anticipate an expense like this — we don’t have rainy day money to deal with it.” .The couple bought the warehouse in 2010. They said that it was their first foray into commercial real estate and that they worked on residential projects before that. They have other tenants and a self-storage section, but are frustrated about the mess and the fact they can’t use the space for anything else until it is cleared. .Brooks Brothers, which was founded in 1818 and is the oldest continuously operated apparel brand in the United States, began renting the warehouse in Enfield in 2011, most recently at a rate of roughly $20,000 a month. (Brooks Brothers also has a corporate office and distribution center in Enfield.) The building, which spans about 375,000 square feet, is held by the LaBontes through KBRC Realty. It’s the firm’s sole holding and the couple’s main source of income. .The office attire segment of retailing as a whole was battered last year as many Americans worked remotely, ditching  .. J. Crew and the owners of Ann Taylor and Men’s Wearhouse also filed for bankruptcy, while sales nose-dived at chains like Banana Republic. Temporary store closures added to the distress, along with the cancellations of special occasions like proms, graduations, weddings and other events. .All that led up to Brooks Brothers’  . one of the most significant retail collapses of 2020. Brooks Brothers had dressed all but four U.S. presidents at the time of its filing, and prided itself on its American factories, which were also forced to close. .But investors saw value in the brand, and the retailer was quickly purchased for $325 million by Simon Property Group, the biggest U.S. mall operator, and Authentic Brands Group, a licensing firm. .The firms have been buying up a string of bankrupt mall retailers through a joint venture called ., including Lucky Brand denim and Forever 21, leveraging the combination of Authentic Brands’ expertise in licensing famous brand names in various lucrative and creative (and some say equity-destructive) ways and Simon’s real estate portfolio. .At the time of the Brooks Brothers purchase, SPARC committed to keep operating at least 125 Brooks Brothers retail locations, compared with 424 retail and outlet stores globally before the pandemic. .Under the new owners, Brooks Brothers switched to wire transfers instead of checks, but kept paying rent on the warehouse through November, sending even more goods there as it closed dozens of stores and shuttered its ., Mr. and Ms. LaBonte said. But after Thanksgiving, it sent a letter to the couple rejecting the lease as well as the contents of the warehouse. According to a person with knowledge of the deal, the warehouse and its contents had not been part of SPARC’s purchase of Brooks Brothers. As a result, said Mr. Van Horn said, the new owner most likely has no legal responsibility to the LaBontes. .A representative for SPARC stopped returning requests for comment. .“They used it for all of their store fixtures, so tables, props, fishing poles, canoes, everything you would see that would go in and out of a store to decorate it,” Mr. LaBonte said. “There’s probably 20,000 square feet of Christmas trees — everything except the actual merchandise.” .As to who would want it now: Customers have included local clothing makers looking for mannequins and a set designer from an upcoming HBO series called “The Gilded Age.” Last Monday, an older couple wandered through the space, looking at the Christmas decorations and empty gift boxes. Habitat for Humanity has been looking at the haul for several days and is taking some of the goods. Still, Mr. LaBonte estimated that somewhere around 30 percent of the leftovers have been sold. .The liquidator paid the LaBontes approximately $20,000 to sell what they can through mid-April or so. The couple will not receive a cut, and will deal with what’s left. When junk removal specialists assessed the cost of clearing the space in December, one quote was around $243,000 while the other was closer to $290,000. .“We’re just another Covid casualty to them, we get that,” Ms. LaBonte said of Brooks Brothers. “But I also don’t think they realized how much stuff was there.” .The junk removal firms, which confirmed the prices with The New York Times, said that it was expensive to remove the volume of goods. The costs included labor, multiple trips to dumps, donation and recycling centers, and the use of specialized equipment such as a forklift, large dumpsters and an 18-foot box truck. .“I’ve been doing this for seven years and I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Rick McDonald Jr., the owner of EastSide Junk, which provided the $243,000 quote to the couple. “They left an astronomical amount of stuff.” .When Authentic Brands, the licensing firm, announced the purchase of Brooks Brothers out of bankruptcy last year, Jamie Salter, the company’s chief executive, spoke about the retailer’s legacy and its “incredible history.” .The LaBontes, confronting a warehouse full of some of that history, were unhappy to see those comments. .They put out a statement recently asking: “What kind of heritage can they claim when they operate like low-rent, fly-by-night bullies?” .Contact Sapna Maheshwari at sapna@nytimes.com or Vanessa Friedman at vanessa.friedman@nytimes.com.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/brooks-brothers-retail-bankruptcy.html
25,,"WASHINGTON — Kimberly Vasquez, a high school senior in Baltimore, faced a tough problem when the pandemic began. She had no fast internet service in her home, but all her classes were online. .Marigold Lewi, a sophomore at the same school, was regularly booted off Zoom classes because of her slow home connection. .Ms. Lewi spent a lot of time explaining Zoom absences to teachers. Ms. Vasquez sat outside local libraries to use their internet access and at times used her phone. The two of them helped push a successful public campaign for better and free service to low-income families in the city. .“It was very chaotic,” Ms. Vasquez said. “We had to do this because no one else was going to change things.” .A year after the pandemic turned the nation’s digital divide into an education emergency, President Biden, inheriting the problem, is making affordable broadband a top priority, comparing it to the effort to spread electricity across the country.  ., announced on Wednesday, includes $100 billion to extend fast internet access to every home. .The money is meant to improve the economy by enabling all Americans to work, get medical care and take classes from wherever they live. Although the government has spent billions on the digital divide in the past, the efforts have failed to close it partly because people in different areas have different problems. Affordability is the main culprit in urban and suburban areas. In many rural areas, internet service isn’t available at all because of the high costs of installation. .“We’ll make sure every single American has access to high-quality, affordable, high speed internet,” Mr. Biden said in a speech on Wednesday. “And when I say affordable, I mean it. Americans pay too much for internet. We will drive down the price for families who have service now. We will make it easier for families who don’t have affordable service to be able to get it now.” .Longtime advocates of universal broadband say the plan, which requires congressional approval, may finally come close to fixing the digital divide, a stubborn problem first identified and named by regulators during the Clinton administration. The plight of unconnected students during the pandemic added urgency. .“This is a vision document that says every American needs access and should have access to affordable broadband,” said Blair Levin, who directed the 2010 National Broadband Plan at the Federal Communications Commission. “And I haven’t heard that before from a White House to date.” .Some advocates for expanded broadband access cautioned that Mr. Biden’s plan might not entirely solve the divide between the digital haves and have-nots. .The plan promises to give priority to municipal and nonprofit broadband providers but would still rely on private companies to install cables and erect cell towers to far reaches of the country. One concern is that the companies won’t consider the effort worth their time, even with all the money earmarked for those projects. During the electrification boom of the 1920s, private providers were reluctant to install poles and string lines hundreds of miles into sparsely populated areas. .There are also many questions about how the administration plans to address affordability. It is one thing to extend service to homes; it is another to make it inexpensive enough for people once it gets there. The White House was scant on details on Wednesday, though it stressed that subsidies alone were not a long-term solution. .In addition, the money would arrive more than a year after the pandemic closed schools and as many were starting to reopen their doors. As a result, many students without good internet connections have already fallen a full year behind. .About 25 percent of students don’t have adequate broadband at home, with Native American, Black and Latino children hardest hit, said Becky Pringle, the president the National Education Association, the teachers’ union. .Mr. Biden’s plan would be tested in places like Chinle, a school district in the Navajo Nation in northeast Arizona. As with electrification, the most remote homes — particularly on Native land — got service last. Today, many homes in that isolated corner of the state have no access to broadband or speeds that are so slow even one device on a Zoom conference takes up most of the bandwidth. Cellular phone service is nonexistent or spotty in many parts. .School is slowly beginning to return to the classroom. But until last week, 31 buses were sent out daily with packets of printouts for homework and flash drives with videos of lessons for math, science, history and English. The graduation rate is expected to be near 60 percent this year, down from 77 percent last year, said Quincy Natay, the superintendent of the Chinle Unified School District. .“It has been a tough and challenging year,” Mr. Natay said. “A lot of learning loss has occurred for this group.” .Congress has approved more than $10 billion in the past few months to help make broadband more affordable and to put more laptops and other devices in students’ hands. Of those funds, the F.C.C. is working to figure out how to distribute $7.2 billion for broadband service, devices, and potentially routers and other equipment for households with school-age children. .In February, the  . for low-income families from $3.2 billion granted by Congress in December for emergency digital divide funding. Both programs involve one-time emergency funding to address broadband access problems exacerbated by the pandemic. .The administration’s $100 billion plan aims to connect even the most isolated residents: the 35 percent of rural homes without access. In those areas, the White House said, it would focus on “future-proof” technology, which analysts take to mean fiber and other high-bandwidth technology. The administration highlighted its support for networks run and owned by municipalities, nonprofits and rural electrical cooperatives. Several states have banned municipal broadband networks, and the F.C.C. failed in its attempts to overturn those bans in court during the Obama administration. .The Biden infrastructure plan faces a tough path in Congress. Republicans have pushed back on the cost. They even argue about definitions of broadband. Republicans balk at some proposals to require faster broadband standards — such as 25 megabits for downloads and as much as 25 megabits for uploads, which they say is a bar too high for providers in rural areas. Those speeds would allow multiple family members to be on videoconferencing, for example. .“I believe that this would make it harder to serve those communities that don’t have broadband today,” Michael O’Rielly, a former F.C.C. commissioner, told the House commerce committee last month. .Educators lobbied Congress throughout the pandemic to extend broadband in the country. When little relief was in sight, some took matters into their own hands. .Last April and through the summer, administrators at the Brockton School District in Massachusetts bought more than 4,000 hot spots with their own funding and a federal loan. They were able to reduce the percentage of students without high-speed internet or a device to about 5 to 10 percent, from about 30 percent. .Superintendent Mike Thomas said the district was starting to go back to classrooms and would most likely be fully in person by the fall. But he plans to retain many aspects of distance learning, he said, particularly after-school tutoring. .In Baltimore, where an estimated 40 percent of households lack high-speed internet, students and community activists fought to raise awareness of their circumstances. Ms. Vasquez and Ms. Lewi held protests against Comcast, the dominant provider, for better speeds and lower costs for its much-publicized low-income program. Their group .Students Organizing a Multicultural and Open Society, also lobbied the Maryland legislature and the city to put a priority on affordable broadband for low-income households. .“We didn’t have options, and we deserved better,” Ms. Vasquez said. .Adam Bouhmad and some community activists began to install antenna “mesh” networks tapping into the hot spots of closed Baltimore schools to connect surrounding homes. Through a jury-rigged system of antennas and routers, Mr. Bouhmad’s group, Waves, got cheap or free internet service to 120 low-income families. .Mr. Biden’s promise to support alternative broadband providers could include projects like the one led by Mr. Bouhmad, who said the past year had shown how scant broadband options had left residents in Baltimore in the lurch. .“Investment upfront to build out infrastructure and support internet providers is fantastic,” Mr. Bouhmad said. He added that residents in places like Baltimore would continue to need federal subsidies and that the administration should focus on the costs of broadband as a major hurdle. .“Availability doesn’t equal accessibility in terms of price and user experience,” he said.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/technology/digital-divide-rural-wifi.html

I understand why you’re trying to raise awareness of D.E.I. and make your employer establish a structured plan.

The U.S. economy lost 1.7 million jobs in March 2020 and more than 20 million in April, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 15 percent. .The job market bounced back quickly at first, but progress began to slow as virus cases surged and states reimposed restrictions on businesses. Over the winter, the recovery stalled out, with employers cutting more than 300,000 jobs in December. .Economists said the latest data marked a turning point.

Mr. Biden is now in a complicated situation: He’s taking a victory lap while pumping the brakes. .“It’s a mixed message,” said Lee Miringoff, the director of polling at Marist College. “There’s an eagerness to pop the champagne cork on one hand, and on the other hand to say, ‘Danger may lurk right around the corner.’ It’s a mixed message, which is hard, and it’s being communicated to a Covid-fatigued country.” .Marist’s most recent poll, for  .,” found that just 25 percent of American adults said they wouldn’t get the vaccine when it became available — a lower degree of reluctance than in any prior Marist poll, driven in part by a thawing of opposition among supporters of former President Donald Trump. .But with only 36 percent of respondents saying they had been vaccinated, there is a variety of experiences to contend with. “You have some people who are opening up because they feel they’re vaccinated, and others who still want to see how this plays out,” Mr. Miringoff said. “So there’s lots of categories now, and that makes political messaging more complicated.” .Even as the president announced this week that 90 percent of adults should be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine by April 19, he said that states should pause their plans to reopen businesses. He called for mask mandates to remain in place, warning that the country might be in danger of “giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains” if governors abandoned them. .Mr. Biden told ESPN yesterday that it would be “a mistake” for the Texas Rangers baseball team to allow a full-capacity crowd to attend Opening Day next week, as the team has said it plans to do. “I think it’s not responsible,” he said. .His comments appeared to be at least partly directed at Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who lifted the state’s mask mandate last month and declared that all businesses could reopen. .Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned this week of “impending doom” if a new surge in cases were allowed to continue unabated. In an interview on Thursday with “CBS This Morning,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and a leader of Biden’s virus response team, echoed Dr. Walensky’s concerns. “Please be careful,” he said. “Don’t declare victory prematurely.” .Air travel  . at small, regional airports and vacation destinations, although those in major cities are still serving only about a quarter to a half of their usual volume. .Some locales, cruise lines and venues are requiring incoming travelers to show vaccination cards proving that they have been inoculated. But the Biden administration has not instituted a policy, leaving it up to the private sector instead. .While hospitalizations and deaths remain far lower than they were during the pandemic’s peak in January, case counts have risen in recent weeks — sometimes drastically — particularly in the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. .Michigan, the site of a pitched debate over virus restrictions last year, leads the country in cases per capita: As of yesterday, seven of the 10 most heavily infected counties in the country are in Michigan. The New York tristate area has also seen a marked rise in cases. .Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative at the Columbia University Earth Institute, said that the decline in cases this winter had understandably created a false sense of security. .“The fact is that we are in a very precarious point, in that where we go from here is not at all clear,” he said in an interview. “On some level, yes, we did drop the daily infection rates and fatality rates, but we dropped them to a level that’s not exactly comforting.” .Dr. Redlener said he supported the administration’s emphasis on delivering vaccinations as quickly as possible, and its insistence on keeping mask mandates in place. .“It’s become somewhat of a cliché, but we are running a race between the vaccine and the variants,” he said. “The more time that it takes to get people vaccinated up to a herd immunity level, which people think is about 80 percent, the longer we’re going to see these outbreaks of Covid-19 that will inevitably create more mutations, more variants.”",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/politics/biden-covid-numbers.html
29,Biden Tax Plan Challenges G.O.P. Formula for Economic Growth,"President Biden’s ambitious plan to increase  . does more than just reverse much of the overhaul pushed through by his predecessor. It also offers a profoundly different vision of how to make the United States more competitive and how to foot the bill. .When President Donald J. Trump and a Republican Congress  ., most of the benefits went to the wealthiest Americans, with lower rates on businesses and on profits from investments. The guiding principle, proponents argued, was that cutting taxes on corporations and investors would encourage businesses to expand, creating more jobs and generating more wealth for everyone. .By contrast, the animating idea behind the tax plan put forward by the Biden administration on Wednesday is that the best way to increase America’s competitiveness and foster economic growth is to raise corporate taxes to finance huge investments in transportation, broadband, utilities and more. .The Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers all welcomed the idea of pumping money into repairing and building the nation’s infrastructure, but recoiled at raising corporate taxes to do so. .“We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally — the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” the chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley,  .. .The biggest and most eye-catching proposal is to trim the sizable reduction in the corporate tax rate enacted under Mr. Trump. In 2017, Republicans shrank the rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Biden wants to nudge the rate part of the way back — to 28 percent. .The increase will “ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” and fund critical investments “to maintain the competitiveness of the United States and grow the economy,” the White House stated in outlining the plan. .The other provisions are primarily intended to ensure that multinational corporations cannot avoid taxes on profits generated overseas. The hope is that this will reduce the temptation to set up operations or offices in foreign tax havens. .The plan, which still lacks detailed provisions, is “both an undoing and a pushing in new directions,” said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School. “The more novel aspects relate to how it changes the way we think about foreign operations and global income.” .Through a series of complex and arcane provisions, the Biden administration would essentially treat profits earned abroad more like those earned at home — raising rates and requiring that taxes be paid on time rather than pushed far into the future. It would also establish what would in effect be a minimum tax on foreign income. .The proposals hew closely to what Mr. Biden promised on the campaign trail, and the immediate reactions mostly fell along predictable lines. Republicans, business groups and conservative economists said they worried that the rate increases would discourage investment. Progressive groups and liberal economists hailed the announcement, saying it would fix some glaring loopholes. . since the presidential election and has hoped that gridlock in Washington would moderate Mr. Biden’s agenda. On Wednesday, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, believed that “the corporate tax rate for companies in the U.S. has to be competitive globally, which it is now.” .Supporters countered that the changes would do much more to promote growth and go a long way in curbing excesses of the 2017 tax legislation. Democrats have argued that the low-tax approach has failed to deliver broad economic gains, with only those at the very top benefiting. Targeted government spending on workers, students and infrastructure, they argue, would offer much more bang for the buck. What’s more, businesses base their decisions on a range of factors besides tax rates. .Even economists favoring low rates on business acknowledge that the 2017 tax cuts did not produce much of an increase in investment. Gross domestic product grew at a rate of  . in the two years leading up to the law and 2.4 percent in the two years after it passed. .“There’s essentially no evidence that the tax change boosted investment,” said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He argued that investment went up in 2018 only because oil prices rose. And while the tax law favored investments in equipment and structures, it turned out that the biggest investments were not in those areas but in intellectual capital. .Supporters also argue that the proposed changes are much fairer. .“The cut in the rate was overdue but may well have been overdone,” Mr. Gale said of the Trump tax cuts. “It gave massive windfall gains to corporations,” rewarding them for investment decisions made in the past instead of providing new incentives to plow money back into their businesses, he said. .Debates about the tax code are really debates about who should bear the burden of paying for what society deems important — highways and bridges, clean water and high-speed broadband, basic research and development. .By shifting the tax burden, the Biden administration is saying corporations — among the biggest winners the last time around — should pick up more of the tab this time. .“We have pressing infrastructure needs, and the fairest way to fund those is to claw back some of the giveaways” to corporations and shareholders contained in the 2017 law, said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. .Mr. Rosenthal also pointed out that a large chunk of the increased tax payments would fall on foreigners, who own 40 percent of stocks. .The advertised tax rate — whether on corporations or individuals — is often much higher than what many actually pay. .The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has long criticized American businesses for managing to avoid paying what they owe, conducted a study of Fortune 500 companies that were profitable and that provided enough information to calculate effective tax rates. The institute found that those companies on average paid  .income. .And 91 of those companies, including Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton and IBM, paid no federal income tax that year. .Existing exemptions and deductions are not evenly distributed. Industrial machinery, gas, oil, electric and chemical companies tend to have the lowest effective rates, often less than 5 percent. .Economists have debated who actually bears the cost of higher corporate taxes — shareholders and owners or workers. Research by the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department and the Brookings Institution has concluded that those who own the business generally pay about three-quarters of a tax increase, with workers picking up the rest. .Mr. Desai at Harvard applauded the infrastructure investment but was put off by the impact of the tax increase on workers. “In a populist moment, it’s good politics but bad economics,” he said. He would prefer taxing individuals’ capital income. He also pointed out that the laserlike focus on corporations — as opposed to other businesses that may be organized differently — tended to penalize large successful companies. .It is still unclear how much would be paid by other groups favored by the current tax code, including the richest Americans and businesses that  .. (They pay taxes at the ordinary rate on their individual returns.) .The Biden administration has indicated that  . will help fund the second phase of the infrastructure plan, which is expected to be announced next month and will focus on priorities like education, health care and paid leave. .Gillian Friedman . and  .Lauren Hirsch . contributed reporting.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-tax-plan.html
30,,"When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, it’s fair to say he wasn’t focused on how to articulate the company’s position on the issue of voting rights. Instead, Mr. Quincey, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and has spent most of his career outside the United States, was consumed with the usual C.E.O. fare — expanding the business, keeping the share price up and not damaging the brand. .But in a measure of just how much politics has permeated big business these days, Mr. Quincey is now embroiled in a fierce debate over a wave of Republican legislation that would effectively make it harder for people to vote, including many Black voters, in some states. .As one such law made its way through the Georgia legislature in recent weeks, activists began to call on Coca-Cola, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, to publicly oppose the proposed law. Though the company doesn’t have a history of weighing in on voting rights one way or another, big companies have become increasingly drawn into social and political conversations in recent years. As a vote on the law drew near, Mr. Quincey was under pressure to pick a side. .Coca-Cola ultimately issued  . saying that “voting is a foundational right in America” and pledging to “work to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country.” But it didn’t publicly weigh in on the legislation before Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it into law last Thursday. .The company’s cautious response drew protests and calls for a boycott from activists, who wanted Coca-Cola, along with other major Georgia companies like Delta Air Lines, to speak out against the new law. More than  . called on corporations to do more to protect voting rights. .Hours after the Black executives made their statement, Mr. Quincey forcefully came out against the Georgia law for the first time. “I want to be crystal clear,”  .. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.” .The statement was welcomed by activists, though many said it was too little, too late. Yet at the same time, Mr. Quincey’s words drew the ire of prominent conservatives, with Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Stephen Miller, an adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, attacking the company on Twitter. .Laws similar to the one just passed in Georgia have been proposed in nearly every state, and, in part to combat that, Congress is working on a sweeping bill that would reform voting rights nationwide. Already, activists dissatisfied with the company’s response in Georgia are pressing the company to do more around the country, while conservatives call on Coca-Cola, and Mr. Quincey, to stay out of politics. .It was another illustration, as if one was needed, of how the political polarization straining the country is creating fault lines in corporate America, with big brands caught in the middle. .The following was condensed and edited from two conversations, the second of which took place six days after the Georgia law was passed. .What changed is the legislation passed. The process was curtailed, was rushed, was not profound enough, and the resulting legislation is unacceptable, and it needs to be corrected. Work needs to be done to make this a step forward, not a step backward, in terms of broader access to voting, and that’s what we’re going to continue to advocate for as we go into this next phase. .Whatever we were doing before was not getting through. People are misconstruing, by honest error or willfully, what we have stood for and what we’re trying to do. Obviously they could disagree whether you should do more or less in private and public. But there’s enough stories out there saying the opposite of what we’ve actually said and believe in. We have to go and correct that at the very minimum, and most importantly, we need to generate some clarity that we’re going to continue to advocate against this bill. .No one in the legislature was under any illusion as to our views on the various drafts or even the final law. They knew. Would it have made any difference if we had said anything publicly? We’ll never know. If we could have done something in retrospect to have made a different outcome, of course, we would have preferred to have done it. Because we don’t like the outcome. .We’re a Georgia-based company. That’s going to be certainly our starting point. I don’t see us having the wherewithal to understand every nuance in every other state. I think there will be energy directed at the federal level. If you go back historically, federal oversight of changing the voting processes in the states has been an important process to make sure that things move forward, not backward. .It’s not that the corporate community was not involved. We were perhaps not as public as some people wish we had been, or perhaps would have made more difference. .You’ve got this tension of getting companies involved — the tension of dragging, or having companies pulled, into politics. When do I get involved? You can’t possibly be involved in every issue. So getting clear on what are the most important things to your company is what we go back to. .We’re very clear on the importance of diversity and inclusion to the Coca-Cola Company, which aspires to be a brand for everyone, and particularly in the South, given its history. We stand for diversity and inclusion in Georgia above all else, and that’s why we came to the table on this issue. We tried to affect change. It didn’t work. But we have not given up by any stretch of the imagination. .When you become C.E.O. you think you’ve got this organizational pyramid and you’ve come at the apex, and now everyone works for you. But then you find out there’s another pyramid, but it’s upside down, and you’re the one person at the bottom. .There’s a huge number of stakeholders who want to tell you what to do, and many of them don’t work in the business. So you deal with the board, the media, the investors, the analysts, the NGOs, the government. You have this whole galaxy of people you need to deal with in a way that was never true for any of the other jobs. If you haven’t gotten really clear on what are the few things that I want to tell people about and prioritize things this, it can be quite destabilizing. .The first step is to realize that something’s going wrong. When you’re a famous brand and a famous company, issues get brought to your door every day. If you want to get attention to something, calling it Coke’s fault, or thinking that Coke could help us get this fixed, is much easier than doing that with Acme, Inc., who no one’s heard of. .That doesn’t mean we should bury our heads in the sand. We need to look at them and work out, whether we agree it’s a real problem, and what are we in favor of as part of the solution? We can’t solve everything. .The starting point is: What does the consumer really want? They want great tasting drinks. And what’s the consequence of some of that? The total food and beverage diet is delivering too many calories and too much sugar. You can get that answer from any health professional. OK. So are we going to tell the consumers what to drink? Are we going to restrict them? We still want to grow our business. But what’s our role in a problem where people are consuming too many calories and too much sugar? We need to get our sugar footprint, for want of a better expression, to go down. .We need the business to grow because if we just sign up to a shrinking business, there’ll be a shareholder revolt. We have to sign up to a growing business with a shrinking sugar footprint. What does that require? Well, it requires us to drive the zero calorie products. It requires us to drive into smaller package sizes. And we need to innovate in drinks that are inherently lower calorie or lower sugar. If we do that, we can actually grow the business and reduce the sugar footprint. .Half our business is away from home. So with the cinemas were closed, the airlines, the hotels, you can see how much it’s down. But what did grow, because people were obliged effectively to spend more time at home, was a resurgence in breakfast. We used to all get up and rush out of apartments to go to work, and many people skip breakfast. Well, now they have more time for it. So juice sales were up.",Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/james-quincey-coca-cola-corner-office.html
31,Biden Seeks to Use Infrastructure Plan to Address Racial Inequities,"WASHINGTON — America’s most celebrated infrastructure initiative, the interstate highway system, rammed an elevated freeway through the center of  . in the late 1960s. .It claimed dozens of Black-owned businesses, along with oak trees and azalea bushes that had shaded Black children playing in the large neutral ground in the middle of the street,  . whose residents fought in vain to stop the construction. .More than a half-century later, President Biden’s $2 trillion plan to rebuild aging roads, bridges, rail lines and other foundations of the economy comes with a new twist: hundreds of billions of dollars that administration officials say will help reverse long-running racial disparities in how the government builds, repairs and locates a wide range of physical infrastructure. .That includes $20 billion to “reconnect” communities of color to economic opportunity, like the Black residents still living in the interstate’s shadow along Claiborne. .Mr. Biden’s plan, which he  ., is the first step in a two-part agenda to remake the American economy. The president and his advisers have pitched that agenda — whose total cost could reach $4 trillion — in the grand terms of economic competitiveness and the granular language of shortened commute times. .But they have also stressed its potential to advance racial equity and bridge gaps in economic outcomes. .In addition to dedicated funding for neighborhoods split or splintered by past infrastructure projects, the proposal also includes money for the replacement of lead water pipes that have harmed Black children in cities like Flint, Mich.; the cleanup of environmental hazards that have plagued Hispanic neighborhoods and tribal communities; worker training that would target underserved groups; and funds for home health aides, who are largely women of color. .More traditional efforts to close racial opportunity gaps, like universal pre-K and more affordable higher education, are coming in the next phase of Mr. Biden’s plans. The exact mix of components is likely to change as Mr. Biden tries to push the plans through Congress. .Given the thin Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate, the  . is likely to be intense and highly partisan, with no assurance the White House will prevail. .Republicans have objected to the  . to fund this phase of his agenda, and they have accused the president of using the popular banner of “infrastructure” to sell what they call unrelated liberal priorities — including many of the programs White House officials say will advance economic opportunity for disadvantaged people and areas. .But liberal economists say the spending on transportation, housing and other areas of Mr. Biden’s initial plan could help advance racial equity, if done correctly. .“This is a promising start,” said Trevon Logan, an economist at Ohio State University whose work includes studies of how government spending projects, like the one that built the interstate highway system, have excluded or hurt Americans who are not white.  .The biggest single piece of the plan’s racial equity efforts is not a transportation or environmental project, but a $400 billion investment in in-home care for older and disabled Americans. It would lift the wages of care workers, who are predominantly low-paid, female and not white. .“It’s the first jobs program that is focused primarily on work done by women of color,” said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union. “It’s going to transform Black, brown and Asian lives, and entire communities.” .White House officials say the $100 billion the plan allocates to improve and build out broadband internet will disproportionately help Black and Latino families, who have less access to affordable broadband than white families do. .Half of the $40 billion the plan would spend to upgrade research labs across the country would be reserved for colleges and universities that historically serve Black and other students of color. .Republicans have complained that much of the bill does not fund what they call traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. “Biden’s plan includes hundreds of billions of spending on left-wing policies and blue-state priorities,” the Republican National Committee wrote in a news release, including “$400 billion for an ‘unrelated’ program for home care that ‘was a top demand of some union groups.’” .Mr. Biden has said he wants bipartisan support for the bill but has angered conservatives and businesses with his calls to fund it by raising taxes on corporations. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that Mr. Biden was open to discussing a narrower infrastructure bill with Republicans, although she said the White House has not received a proposal from them. .She declined to say what provisions Mr. Biden might be willing to drop. .“The administration designed this bill with an effort to meet the moment and to do it in a way that ensures we are looking at addressing challenges in our country through a lens of equity,” Ms. Psaki said. .Administration officials say concerns over racial inequality are an animating force of the infrastructure push. They peppered a 25-page explanation of the jobs plan this week with references to racial equity, and they included two specific examples of the sort of communities they hope to lift with the $20 billion for economic revitalization: the Black neighborhood in Syracuse  . to make way for Interstate 81, and the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans. .Government infrastructure spending is meant to make the economy work more efficiently. Freeways and rail lines speed goods from factories to market. Roads and transit systems carry workers from their homes to their jobs. .But for some communities of color, those projects devastated existing economies, leveling commercial corridors, cutting Black neighborhoods off from downtowns and accelerating suburbanization trends that exacerbated segregation. .“A lot of previous government investment in infrastructure purposely excluded these communities,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a deputy director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council. “So if you look at where we need to invest in infrastructure now, a lot of it is concentrated in these communities.” .Past projects were often built in communities that did not have the political capital or resources to successfully protest. .“When it comes time to build an interstate through a city, a pattern emerges: The areas that are displaced by that interstate will overwhelmingly be the areas occupied by African-Americans,” Dr. Logan said. Often, he added, lawmakers choose to build “in the places that have the least political power to make sure this doesn’t happen in their neighborhood.” .Eric Avila, an urban historian at the University of California, Los Angeles, said a consensus during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration on the need to invest in highways that would connect neighborhoods to cities led to the exclusion of minority communities. .The federal government also used “urban renewal” or “slum clearance” redevelopment programs that often led to the clearing of the way for giant infrastructure projects like highways. .“These highways were essentially built as conduits for wealth,” Mr. Avila said. “Primarily white wealth, jobs, people, markets. The highways were built to promote the connectivity between suburbs and cities. The people that were left out were urban minorities. African-Americans, immigrants, Latinos.” .Mr. Avila pointed to how plans for the Inner Belt highway in Cambridge, Mass., were halted after protests by faculty members at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. .And in New Orleans, Mr. Avila said, plans for a highway called the Riverfront Expressway were canceled after officials faced pressure from protesters in the French Quarter. But Black protesters were not able to spare Treme, one of the nation’s oldest communities of free Black residents, from the construction of an elevated six-lane stretch of Interstate 10 along Claiborne Avenue. .Amy Stelly is reminded of that freeway each morning when the truck traffic causes her home to shudder. The emissions from the interstate a block away have turned jewelry that she placed near her window jet black. .“Anyone who lives near an urban highway knows what we’re breathing in every day,” said Ms. Stelly, an urban designer and activist against the project. “There’s a layer of silt that sticks on our properties and houses.” .It is unclear from Mr. Biden’s plan, and conversations with White House officials, what the administration envisions for Claiborne Avenue. If the funding survives in any bill Mr. Biden might sign into law, those details will matter, said Deborah Archer, a director of the Center on Race, Inequality and the Law at New York University School of Law. .“I think it’s wonderful to be able to say and have the goal that this historic investment will advance racial equity,” Ms. Archer said. “It’s another thing to distribute these funds in a way that has impact.”",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/politics/biden-infrastructure-racial-equity.html
32,"No Federal Taxes for Dozens of Big, Profitable Companies","Just as the Biden administration is pushing to  . on corporations, a new study finds that at least  . last year on billions of dollars in profits. .The  . passed in 2017 by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Donald J. Trump reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. But dozens of Fortune 500 companies were able to further shrink their tax bill — sometimes to zero — thanks to a range of legal deductions and exemptions that have become staples of the tax code, according to the analysis. .Salesforce, Archer-Daniels-Midland and Consolidated Edison were among those named in the report, which was done by the  ., a left-leaning research group in Washington. .Twenty-six of the companies listed, including FedEx, Duke Energy and Nike, were able to avoid paying any federal income tax for the last three years even though they reported a combined income of $77 billion. Many also received millions of dollars in tax rebates. .Companies’ tax returns are private, but publicly traded corporations are required to file  . that include federal income tax expense. The institute used that data along with other information supplied by each company on its pretax income. .Catherine Butler, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, responded in an email that the company “fully complies with federal and state tax laws as part of our efforts to make investments that will benefit our customers and communities.” .She pointed out that the bonus depreciation, intended to encourage investment in areas like renewable energy, “caused Duke’s cash tax obligations to be deferred to future periods, but it did not eliminate them.” According to a filing at the end of 2020, Duke has a deferred federal tax balance of $9 billion that will be paid in the future. .DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility that was also found to have paid no federal taxes for three years, said major investments in modernizing aging infrastructure and new solar and wind technologies were the primary reasons last year. “For utilities, the benefit of these federal tax savings are passed on to utility customers in the form of lower utility bills,” it said in a statement. .A provision in the 2017 tax bill allowed businesses to immediately write off the cost of any new equipment and machinery. .The $2.2 trillion CARES Act, passed last year to help businesses and families survive the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus, also contained a provision that temporarily allowed businesses to use losses in 2020 to offset profits earned in previous years, according to the institute. .DTE used that provision to get an accelerated refund of credits representing $220 million of previously paid alternative minimum taxes, the company said. .FedEx, too, took advantage of provisions in the CARES Act, using losses in 2020 to reduce tax bills from previous years when the tax rate was higher.  .The report is the latest fodder in a debate over whether and how to revise the tax code. Policymakers, business leaders and tax experts argue that many deductions and credits are there for good reason — to encourage research and development, to promote expansion and to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle, taking a longer view of profit and loss than can be calculated in a single year. .“The fact that a lot of companies aren’t paying taxes says there are a lot of provisions and preferences out there,” said Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. “It doesn’t tell you whether they’re good or bad or indifferent. At most it’s a starting point, certainly not an ending point.” .He pointed out that the Biden administration itself supported tax credits for green energy investments. .The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has been issuing a form of its report on corporate taxes for decades. During the 2020 presidential campaign, its findings grabbed center stage, with  . citing it to argue the tax code was deeply flawed. .Tax avoidance strategies include a mix of old standards and new innovations. Companies, for example, saved billions by allowing top executives to buy discounted stock options in the future and then deducting their value as a loss. .The Biden administration announced this week that it planned to  . to 28 percent, and establish a kind of minimum tax that would limit the number of zero-payers. The White House estimated that the revisions would raise $2 trillion over 15 years, which will be used to fund the president’s ambitious  .. .Supporters say that in addition to yielding revenue, the rewrite would help make the tax code more equitable, requiring individuals and companies at the top of the income ladder to pay more. But  . that the tax increases in the Biden proposal — which Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, called “massive” — will preclude bipartisan support. .Referring to the proposed revisions, Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the taxation institute, said, “If I were going to make a list of the things I would want the corporate tax reform to do, this outline tackles all these issues.” .Deductions and exemptions wouldn’t disappear, but other changes like the minimum tax would reduce their value, he said.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/business/economy/zero-corporate-tax.html

34,,"Go page by page through Georgia’s new voting law, and one takeaway stands above all others: The Republican legislature and governor have made  ., making absentee voting harder and creating restrictions and complications in the wake of narrow losses to Democrats. .The New York Times has examined and annotated the law, identifying 16 provisions that hamper the right to vote for some Georgians or strip power from state and local elections officials and give it to legislators. .Republicans passed and signed the  . last week following the first Democratic victories in presidential and Senate elections in Georgia in a generation. President Biden won the state by  . out of nearly five million cast. The new law will, in particular, curtail ballot access for voters in booming urban and suburban counties, home to many Democrats. Another provision makes it a crime to offer water to voters waiting in lines, which tend to be longer in densely populated communities. .Below is The Times’s analysis of the law, including the specific provisions and some struck-through language from the state’s previous voting legislation. .Georgia has cut by more than half the period during which voters may request an absentee ballot, from nearly six months before an election to less than three. .This will almost certainly reduce the number of people who seek absentee ballots and the number of people who vote.  ., 1.3 million Georgians — about 26 percent of the state’s electorate — voted with absentee ballots. Of those who returned absentee ballots in 2020, 65 percent voted for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 34 percent chose Donald J. Trump. .The shorter window will also limit opportunities for get-out-the-vote efforts and could put greater strain on local election boards, which will have less time to process ballot requests. .Previously, Georgia law required voters to simply sign their absentee ballot applications. Now they will have to provide the number from a driver’s license or an equivalent state-issued identification. This is virtually certain to limit access to absentee voting. .The law also creates pitfalls for voters: If they fail to follow all the new steps, like printing a date of birth or in some cases including partial Social Security numbers, their ballots could be tossed out. Mr. Trump’s lawyers and allies urged judges and Republican officials last year to invalidate some ballots that were out of compliance. Stringent voter-ID laws in other states have depressed voting mostly among people of color. .When the coronavirus pandemic hit last year, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, mailed absentee ballot applications to every registered voter in the state ahead of its June primary election. This led to absentee voting by record numbers of Georgians. .When Mr. Raffensperger didn’t mail applications again for the general election, several local government agencies did so, particularly in Georgia’s large urban counties — a move that the state has now made illegal. With the loss of automatically mailed applications, some voters will invariably not request ballots, since the applications also served as a reminder to people that they were eligible to vote. .The new law also forbids third-party groups to prefill applications for voters, which made applying for an absentee ballot easier for many voters. .For the 2020 election, there were 94 drop boxes across the four counties that make up the core of metropolitan Atlanta: Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett. The new law limits the same four counties to a total of, at most, 23 drop boxes, based on  .. The number could be lower depending on how many early-voting sites the counties provide. .There won’t just be fewer drop boxes. Instead of 24-hour access outdoors, the boxes must be placed indoors at government buildings and early-voting sites and will thus be unavailable for voters to drop off their ballots during evenings and other nonbusiness hours. .The measure is likely to have the effect of pushing absentee voters to return ballots through the mail, which in 2020  . as in the past because of cuts to the Postal Service. .Last year, Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, had  . during the early voting periods, effectively bringing polling sites to people at churches, parks and public libraries. In the November election, more than 11,200 people voted at the two vehicles in Fulton County. .Georgia has now outlawed this practice, unless the governor declares a state of emergency to allow it — something that Mr. Kemp, a Republican, is unlikely to do given that it could increase voter turnout in Atlanta. .These new strict rules on early voting hours are likely to curtail voting access for Georgians who work daytime hours or have less flexible schedules and who may be unable to return an absentee ballot. .The provision requires counties to hold early voting during weekday working hours — 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — and says it may be held for longer but may not take place before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on those days. The early voting period will begin four weeks before an election. The previous iteration of the law called only for early voting during “normal business hours” and left it up to counties to determine those hours. .The provision also adds a second required Saturday of early voting (the previous law required only one), which will increase access to early voting in most of the state’s rural counties, where election administrators have often been short-staffed and have offered fewer hours of early voting. Most larger counties in the state already offered multiple weekend days of early voting. .The law doesn’t require the availability of early voting on Sundays, which means that counties can choose whether to open for early voting on up to two Sundays before an election. .Counties that choose not to open on Sundays would be limiting ballot access for parishioners at Black churches that have  . after Sunday services. .Perhaps no provision in the Georgia law has received more attention than this one, which effectively bars third-party groups or anyone else who is not an election worker from providing food and water to voters waiting in line. Republicans defended the provision, saying it is enforceable only within a 150-foot radius of polling places. Civil rights groups note that it also prevents assistance “within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place.” .Long lines for voting in Georgia are an unfortunate reality, and are often found in the poorer, densely populated communities that tend to vote Democratic. During the primary election last June, when temperatures hovered above 80 degrees with high humidity, multiple voting locations across the state  .. .Numerous studies have shown that long lines deter people from voting. According to  ., an independent research group, over 560,000 voters did not cast ballots in 2016 “because of problems related to polling place management, including long lines.” In 2014, Stephen Pettigrew, then a Ph.D. candidate in Harvard’s department of government,  . found that more than 200,000 voters did not vote in the midterm elections that year because they had faced long lines during the 2012 election. .The new law does make it clear that it is legal for voters to drink from a water fountain, if one exists along the line to vote and provided they get the water themselves. .From 2012 to 2018, Georgia shuttered more than 214 voting precincts around the state, according to  .. Those changes, many of which followed the Supreme Court’s  . in 2013, confused many voters, who upon showing up to the wrong precinct had to vote with provisional ballots. .This provision removes even that remedy for voters who arrive at the wrong precinct before 5 p.m., requiring them to instead travel to the correct precinct or risk being disenfranchised. .Casting a provisional ballot after showing up at the wrong precinct was by far the most common reason for voting provisionally in the 2020 election in Georgia; roughly 44 percent of provisional ballots in the state were from “out of precinct voters,”  .. And in Fulton County,  . were from “out of precinct” voters. .Of the  . that were counted in the 2020 presidential election, Mr. Biden won 64 percent and Mr. Trump took 34 percent. .This is a small change, but it could have a significant impact on whether voting hours can be extended in the event of a problem. .Previously, a judge could order that a precinct stay open for as long as necessary based on a problem that had hindered voting (for example, if power went out for 30 minutes, the judge could add an hour of balloting at the end of the day). The new provision requires any relief period to match exactly the amount of time that people were unable to vote. .Georgia is no stranger to Election Day mishaps and problems. Its primary last June was marred by hourslong lines caused by malfunctioning machines. Some precincts had no choice but to ask every voter to file a provisional ballot. Other precincts stayed open later into the night. .Under the new law, if similar election problems were to occur, voters who had to leave would have less time to come back later. .One key factor in how widely Mr. Trump and his allies were able to spread falsehoods about the 2020 election was that it took more than two weeks for news outlets to declare that President Biden had won Georgia. With such a long delay, Republicans successfully sowed doubts about the election’s validity by baselessly arguing that fraud must have taken place. .Georgia Republicans’ new voting law does allow the absentee ballot counting process to begin much earlier, with local clerks allowed to open and inspect absentee ballots three weeks before an election. .Still, no ballots can be counted until the polls close, meaning the process of tabulating and reporting vote totals is likely to be lengthy for high-turnout contests. That could lead future candidates to follow Mr. Trump’s lead in trying to contest the results of a legitimate election. .Last year, as election officials faced countless challenges trying to hold voting during a pandemic, funding for the November general election became tied up in  . over the second stimulus package. .Many local election jurisdictions in Georgia and other states, particularly those in poorer urban areas, turned to outside philanthropic groups like the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit organization funded by Mark Zuckerberg that helped counties pay for their elections in 2020. Now Georgia has eliminated that option. .Conspiracy theories in right-wing circles have long focused on the specter of nefarious outsiders swaying election operations with donations; the theories often involve anti-Semitic falsehoods about George Soros, the billionaire liberal donor, who is also Jewish. .Complaints about possible voter intimidation and fraud had previously been run through a web of county election officials and the secretary of state before reaching the state attorney general, but this provision centralizes them and deputizes the attorney general to handle them. .Placing that responsibility within the attorney general’s office may help remove partisan influence to actions that are taken in response to complaints, but voting rights groups say it could serve as an intimidation tactic. And attorneys general themselves could bring their own partisan influence. .This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role. .The law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general. .The provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions. .But it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims. .This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board. .Viewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud. .Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement. .Now the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election. .The law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections. .In the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement. .Georgia has had its fair share of runoff elections recently; both of its newly seated Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, prevailed in such contests. The shortening of the runoff election window, which Republicans say was meant to help election administrators, could also end up overburdening them, forcing a quick turnaround to hold a runoff election even as officials are still working to certify and ratify the initial general election vote. .Shortening the runoff time will also affect both early voting and military and overseas voters. While the bill states that early voting for a runoff should begin “as early as possible,” it does not specifically require weekend voting. .Additionally, federal election law states that ballots for military and overseas voters must be mailed out 45 days before an election, so those voters will now receive ranked-choice general-election ballots rather than second, separate ballots for the runoff.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/georgia-voting-law-annotated.html
35,"The Pandemic Hit the Working Class Hard. The Colleges That Serve Them Are Hurting, Too.","The coronavirus pandemic has been uniquely hard on America’s working class, causing  . among people without college degrees and eliminating low-wage jobs by the millions. Now, the education system created to help those very workers also is in jeopardy. .Colleges of all types are struggling under the shadow of the  ., but the nation’s community college system has been disproportionately hurt, with tens of thousands of students being forced to delay school or drop out because of the pandemic and the economic crisis it has created. .Enrollment is down by 9.5 percent at the more than 1,000 two-year colleges in the United States compared with numbers from last spring, according to figures from the  ., a nonprofit organization that found a similar drop last fall. That is more than double the loss experienced by four-year schools. .Community college enrollment among Black and Hispanic students has declined even more sharply, with a 19 percent drop from fall 2019 to fall 2020 among Black students and a 16 percent drop among Hispanic students. Of the nation’s five million students enrolled at community colleges, about 40 percent are Black or Latino and nearly half are low-income, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. .“Many of our students come to college with challenges,” said Tracy D. Hall, president of Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis. “Now you add a pandemic to that, it just exacerbates it.” .Community colleges, a vast majority of which are state-run schools, have historically provided a low-cost alternative for students who lack financial backing from their parents or academic preparation for four-year colleges. They also are a critical training ground for students seeking jobs in local businesses, from auto mechanics and welders to dental hygienists. About 27 percent of the nation’s more than 17 million college students are enrolled in two-year programs. .President Biden, whose wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is a professor at a community college, has cited the importance of community colleges to educational equity. In the coming weeks, he is expected to propose making  . as part of the  . that he  .. .By arranging free tuition for many, though possibly not all, students, the Biden plan would also free up other forms of federal aid to low-income students, such as Pell Grants, to pay for things like housing, food or books, according to congressional aides who have been briefed on aspects of the proposal.  . are often cited as major reasons for low-income students to drop out of college. .Over all, community colleges in Tennessee have lost about 10 percent of their total enrollment, mirroring the national figures. Southwest, a two-year public school with seven locations in the western part of the state, has lost 19 percent of its enrollment in the past year, making it one of the most profoundly affected of Tennessee’s 13 community colleges. .At Southwest, about 800 Black men have paused their studies. Now there is concern that the pandemic will permanently derail their educational paths, along with low-income and minority students across the country — potentially deepening educational inequities with white students. .“It’s depressing,” said Russ Deaton, executive vice chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, which oversees community colleges in the state. “A lot of the students we’ve lost were loosely tethered to higher education anyway. It didn’t take much to push them out of the education path.” .Many community college students are adults — the average age is 28 — and even before the pandemic, they struggled to stay in school, juggling academic work with financial pressures, child care needs and even homelessness.  . showed that at least 40 percent of students at community colleges left school before earning a certificate or degree. .For these students, the pandemic upset an already difficult balancing act, leaving many just plain exhausted. For Corey Ray Baranowski — a 33-year-old father of five children, age 5 months to 11 years old — the breaking point came last year. .Before the health crisis, Mr. Baranowski and his wife juggled their large family, several jobs and studies at Jackson State Community College, another school that was hit hard by the pandemic, in Jackson, Tenn., 90 miles northeast of Memphis. .The dominoes started tumbling last spring, when the pandemic reached his small community of Lexington, Tenn. .First, the school system where both Mr. Baranowski and his wife, a photographer, had worked as substitute teachers shut down. Then, that same day, their three school-age children were sent home to learn remotely. Their community college also suspended in-person classes. .“It was unsettling,” Mr. Baranowski recalled. He and his wife, then expecting their fifth child, struggled to keep up their own schoolwork while making sure the children did theirs, overloading the family’s home computer capacity — and their multitasking skills. .“There were some bologna sandwiches and peanut butter and jelly going on, trying to manage money,” Mr. Baranowski said. Overwhelmed, he dropped two classes last spring and decided not to re-enroll this year. .But in August, Mr. Baranowski found a job at a juvenile correctional center. The couple hopes to return to college next fall. .“My goal is to graduate and become a teacher,” he said. .As George Pimentel, the president of Jackson State, puts it, “Many of our students have just hit the pause button.” .Community colleges normally lose students during boom times when jobs are plentiful, then see enrollment increase during economic downturns as unemployed people seek training for new careers — as happened after the recession of 2009. .So why is there currently an enrollment bust during a downturn? One theory is that the relief packages enacted by Congress, combined with the hope that jobs will return swiftly once the pandemic is over, have made those who are unemployed less apt to enroll in community colleges to retrain for new careers. .“There’s always been a sense that jobs are going to come back as soon as the numbers go down, so why would you start a degree program?” said Doug Shapiro, executive research director for the National Student Clearinghouse. .Another theory is that many of the skills taught at community colleges do not transfer well to online teaching formats. Rushton W. Johnson, vice president of student affairs at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., which has had a 15 percent enrollment decline since last spring, says the pandemic was a “perfect storm” for community colleges. .“It’s impossible to learn to weld, drive a truck, cook, draw blood, wire a network online, without handling the equipment and tools,” Mr. Johnson said. .While many low-income students in Tennessee can attend community college tuition-free by using federal and state grants, job disruptions have made it difficult for many to pay for basic living expenses. .Last spring, Katie Dollar, 25, could no longer afford rent when the game arcade where she was working closed because of the pandemic. She packed up and returned home to live with her father, with plans to continue her studies at Pellissippi online. .But the balky satellite internet service at her father’s rural Tennessee farm made it impossible for her to participate in remote classes. “Livestreaming classes was not an option,” Ms. Dollar, a theater student, said. .She decided not to enroll in the fall, but she is back in school this semester after landing a job at a Trader Joe’s and a new apartment. .Enrollment declines have been particularly steep among first-year students who have never attended college at all, including high school graduates of 2020. Freshmen enrollment dropped by 19 percent at community colleges in Tennessee. .The pandemic has also blown a hole in community college budgets, forcing layoffs in some cases. The financial hit to community colleges has been exacerbated by state funding cuts aimed disproportionately at two-year colleges, according to  . by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association. Southwest is facing a budget shortfall — more than $10 million — and is hoping to be rescued with funds from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package signed this month by Mr. Biden. .Of the nearly $40 billion that is allocated for colleges in the bill, an estimated $12.7 billion will go to community colleges, according to the American Association of Community Colleges. .With its main campuses in Memphis, a predominantly Black city, Southwest is expected to receive about $12 million from the stimulus package. .Dr. Deaton, of the Tennessee Board of Regents, said that aggressive outreach to students could be the key to encouraging many of them to re-enroll. Community colleges throughout the state are already working to lure back the students who had their education disrupted by the pandemic. .Southwest has begun such outreach, convincing 80 Black male students to return. It also purchased 3,500 laptops for students, installed wireless internet coverage in a parking lot and provided hot spots in some homes to encourage students to stay enrolled. .But Southwest has yet to persuade Charles Moore to come back. .A year ago, Mr. Moore, 20, was supporting himself by waiting tables while studying criminal justice at Southwest. Then the coronavirus spread to the United States and his plans for a college degree fell apart. .First his employer, the Olive Garden, laid him off. When his campus shut down and shifted to remote classes, he struggled to adapt to learning online. He was able to get a new job in security, but it required him to commute into Mississippi, leaving him little time to do his schoolwork. In May, he dropped out. .Mr. Moore says he wants to be a sheriff’s deputy, a job that does not require a college degree. So amid the uncertainty and unpredictability of the pandemic, he has made no immediate plans to return to school. .But he still thinks about campus life, about being exposed to new people and ideas, about getting “that college experience.” .“It felt like I was headed toward something,” he said.",Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/us/politics/covid-19-colleges.html
36,‘Here We Go Baby’: Francisco Lindor Truly Commits to the Mets,"WASHINGTON — Unable to contain his jubilation, Francisco Lindor unleashed a short celebratory scream in his hotel room late Wednesday when his agent informed him that the Mets had agreed to give him a franchise record 10-year, $341 million contract extension. .Shortly after, as Lindor told his father about his brief outburst and suggested he wanted to yell even more, Miguel Lindor urged his son to practice decorum and not to make a racket in the hotel. .No chance of that. And the only way Francisco Lindor, 27, could make his father understand how impossible it would have been to remain quiet at such a moment was to make a comparison an average person might be able to grasp. .“You know when you drive down the highway and you see a billboard for the Powerball that says $300 million?” Lindor, the Mets’ gifted shortstop, told reporters on a video conference call on Thursday. “Imagine you getting that right now. You are going to tell me you aren’t going to scream? I am going to scream. I want to scream. I’ve been working for years my whole entire life.” .After several days of high-stakes negotiations, Lindor hit baseball’s lottery when team owner Steven Cohen agreed to sign Lindor to the largest contract the Mets have ever given to a player, a deal worth $1 million more than the 14-year contract San Diego Padres shortstop Fernando Tatis, 22, agreed to in February. .Lindor’s extension, which includes a limited no-trade clause, kicks in after this season. He was already set to earn $22.3 million this season, and this extension commits him to the Mets through 2031. .“I’m humbled by this opportunity to be in this organization for the next 11 years,” said Lindor, who was drafted by Cleveland in 2011. “It’s an honor, it’s a privilege to wear blue and orange.” .But for a couple of days it felt as if it might not happen. Lindor, whom the Mets acquired from Cleveland in  ., and the Mets reached the agreement less than 24 hours before a Thursday deadline that Lindor had set at the time of the trade. Missing that deadline of opening day would ostensibly have halted negotiations until after the season, when Lindor would have entertained offers from any of the other 29 teams. .But with the deal in place, Lindor enters a new season without the pressure to perform well enough to earn over a third of a billion dollars in free agency. He also avoids the possibility of being thrown into a glutted shortstop market with several other excellent players, like Houston’s Carlos Correa, the Chicago Cubs’ Javier Baez, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Corey Seager and Colorado’s Trevor Story, each of whom will potentially hit free agency at the same time. .For some players, the pressure of producing a strong statistical year ahead of free agency can result in a substandard season. But Lindor said he always felt the pressure to perform, regardless of his contract status. .“The need to put up great numbers? That’s there every year,” he said, “Whether it was rookie season, sophomore season, third year, fourth and so on. I want to put up good numbers to win. I want to win. If I put up good numbers I give my team a chance to win.” .Indeed, Lindor had already put up some of the best numbers in baseball at any position in his six seasons with Cleveland, and the contract demonstrated that the Mets see him as a foundational player for the next decade, ready to take his place among  .. .Not only is he a brilliant defensive shortstop, but he hit at least 32 home runs and 40 doubles in each of the three full seasons before the pandemic and he scored at least 99 runs in each of his last four full seasons. He also has more home runs (111) and extra base hits (258) than any other shortstop over the last four seasons. .Although he has not yet played a real game for the Mets — Thursday’s scheduled season opener  . because the Washington Nationals had a coronavirus outbreak — Lindor said he felt comfortable enough with the team during spring training to commit to them, and feels the Mets have a core group of players that are good enough to compete for a championship, especially with the Mets now able to rely on Cohen’s financial resources backing the operation. .Lindor added that he was not bothered by any of Cohen’s comments on his Twitter account during the final days of negotiations, especially when the talks appeared to have stalled. Cohen had written that he would crowdsource suggestions for how much to pay Lindor, and later said that he hoped Lindor would sign on with the Mets for what at that time appeared to be the team’s final offer of $325 million. .“The crowdsource one, that was funny, that was a funny one,” Lindor said. “I told them at dinner. The other ones, at that point I already shut down my phone and everything on social media. So, I didn’t really care too much for it, because at that point it was like, ‘All right, we’re either going to get this done or not.’” .After the deal was finalized, Lindor said he spent the rest of the night alone in his room, calling his fiancée — whom he described as “nervous” about moving to a big city like New York — his close friends in and out of the game, and family members, especially his father, who helped teach Lindor how to play baseball with grueling drills when the son was a kid. .Lindor is very close to his father and said that no matter how much money he makes, his father’s stern example and high standards will ensure that Lindor will always work as hard as he can. .“It is possible that a little kid from Puerto Rico, that wasn’t the best in school, that wasn’t the most fluent talking, that came to the States not knowing the language, that stayed in a hotel with his stepmom, his dad his stepsister and his little sister in one hotel room with just a microwave. Look where I am today.” .When Lindor was asked if he had any messages for supporters of the Mets now that the deal was completed, he flashed that signature smile that has earned him the nickname, Mr. Smile. .“Here we go, baby,” he said. “We have 11 years together.” .For Mets fans who have waited over a decade for their team to sign a huge contract for a marquee superstar, those words could be enough to make some of them scream out, too.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/francisco-lindor-mets-extension.html
37,,"Saul Malek grew up surrounded by sports. .He played soccer and Little League, and shot hoops at the neighborhood court. He was obsessed with the Houston Astros. When they won, he was ecstatic. Once when they lost, he whipped a belt at a wall so hard he chipped the paint. .Mr. Malek joined a fantasy baseball league while in middle school. In college, an acquaintance connected him with a bookie. Winning his first bet — $10 that the Royals would beat the Blue Jays — made him feel “like a big shot,” he said. .But he soon found that he needed “nonstop action.” He would find an online sports book and maybe win enough to pay a former bookie back. More often, though, he’d lose. Then he would block the bookie’s number, find a new sports book and repeat. .His parents bailed him out for hundreds of dollars several times, but he didn’t seek help until he “felt physically uncomfortable” one night after not placing a bet in time. He realized he didn’t have any close relationships left. .Mr. Malek, now 23 and living in Houston, said he had never considered that sports betting could escalate to an addiction that would lead him to lie, cheat and manipulate people for money. And yet he has come to have plenty of company as policy shifts and technological advances have made it easier than ever to wager money on sports. .Analysts and recovery advocates worry that efforts to research the long-term implications of legal sports betting and warn participants about the risks for addiction are falling short, particularly for people in their late teens and early 20s who are most vulnerable. .“We’re now in a phase where the nation has an appetite for sports betting,” said Dr. Timothy Fong, a professor of psychiatry with specialty in addiction at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s created this new form of entertainment that society has approved, but that form of entertainment does have a potential for addiction.” .Long restricted to Nevada, sports betting expanded rapidly after the Supreme Court overturned federal prohibitions against it in 2018. It is now  . In many states, people can legally and conveniently wager money using their smartphones, betting on point spreads or results, or placing so-called proposition bets on events like the coin toss or which color of Gatorade will be dumped on the winning coach. .Americans wagered $13 billion on sports with legal operators in 2019, according to the  ., the industry’s trade group, with popular events like the Super Bowl whipping bettors into a frenzy. The Gaming Association expects  ., which reach a climax with the Final Four stage for the women on Friday and the men on Saturday. .Most adults who bet on sports do so without major negative consequences. But about 1 percent of American adults have a gambling disorder, in which the core symptom is continuing to gamble despite harmful consequences, said Dr. Fong, who is a director of the Gambling Studies Program at U.C.L.A.  .A vast majority of those with a serious gambling problem never seek or gain access to treatment, he said. . that sports bettors are typically male, under 35, single, educated and employed or preparing for a career. According to a new survey commissioned by the National Council on Problem Gambling, sports bettors showed significantly higher levels of problematic gambling than other gamblers. The risk of addiction is higher for young adults — specifically sports bettors — than for those of any other age, the survey found. .According to  ., a subgroup of the International Center for Responsible Gaming, 6 percent of college students in the United States have a serious gambling problem that can lead to psychological difficulties, unmanageable debt and failing grades. .Young adults are at particular risk for developing a gambling problem, especially if there is a family history of gambling or if they are introduced to it at a young age, Dr. Fong said. The increased accessibility of online gambling may accelerate the development of problems, he said — a phenomenon known as  .. .As sports betting has grown — household names like FanDuel and DraftKings now offer legal avenues — the need for recovery programs and dedicated treatment facilities has quickly outpaced their availability, recovery experts said. Rick Benson, the founder of the Algamus Gambling Recovery Center in Arizona, said the number of young adults who have sought treatment for gambling problems has more than doubled in the past two years. .Sex, drugs and alcohol are commonly covered in school and in the coming-of-age conversations that parents have with their children, but discussions about the consequences of gambling are rare, former gamblers and experts said. This can lead young people to underestimate the addictive nature of sports betting and other forms of gambling. Warnings, often in small fonts, that caution visitors to online sports books and gambling websites about the risks of addiction are easily overlooked. .“You can do it 24/7 from right on your phone,” said one recovered gambling addict, a 38-year-old man who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was about to embark on a job search. .“It’s really, really dangerous,” he said, noting he had contacted a few websites during his recovery and asked to be blocked, but they had allowed him to reopen his accounts after he relapsed. .Over the last 30 years in the United States, there has been a shift in the cultural perception of gambling, said Keith Whyte, director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, a research and advocacy group. Once viewed as a vice, sports betting in particular has become more widely accepted as a form of entertainment and as a new source of tax revenue for the states that have legalized it, he said. .“It’s now become a positive element of state, financial or economic policy. But it’s also addictive, and therein lies the rub,” said Mr. Whyte, whose organization is neutral on the legalization of gambling. “It’s the only addictive service or product where a state government is so heavily involved.” .But when people become addicted, the blame often falls on the individual rather than on an industry whose advertising and marketing, including bonuses and risk-free trials, are targeted to young men. .More than half of adults  . attributed gambling problems “at least in part to moral weakness or lack of willpower,” and fewer than half said they believed a medical or a genetic condition played a role. Half of those surveyed said “people with a gambling problem are to blame for their problems.” .“It’s still seen as a moral failing rather than a medical disorder,” Mr. Whyte said. “Americans have made that connection with drugs and alcohol, but they haven’t made that connection yet for gambling.” .According to the  ., $4.4 billion was wagered with legal sports books across the country in January, the sixth consecutive month in which a “national handle record” was broken. The  . took in nearly $908.9 million in sports betting revenue from more than $13 billion in wagers in 2019, more than double the $430.7 million in revenue they collected in 2018. .The states that authorized gambling on sports as a new source of revenue and jobs “are also the ones who are supposed to be protecting their citizens from the adverse effects they’re talking about,” Mr. Whyte said. “They’re supposed to be balancing the costs and benefits.” .Many young adults have embraced gambling and sports betting as new social traditions. There are March Madness brackets, poker nights and casino fund-raisers for fraternities and sororities. .“It’s just so accepted, so acceptable, it makes it just so easy to get involved with,” Mr. Malek said. “It’s advertised as a normal part of being, like, a 20-year-old guy: Make some money, make some sports bets, make your fantasy team — whatever. It’s just cool.” .Mr. Malek said his struggle with addiction motivated him to pursue a master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He discusses his addiction openly with the hope that doing so will sound an alarm about how quickly and easily dabbling in sports betting can lead to disaster. .He recalled the older participants in the 12-step program he completed sharing stories of reading the newspaper to find out the scores of games from the night before, and calling their bookies on the phone. .“I think that the industry of sports betting is definitely evolving, which is scary for the public,” Mr. Malek said. “You’re always clicks away from it anytime you want it. It’s out there 24/7. I don’t think that people are aware of how devastating the consequences of this will be.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/sports-betting-addiction.html
38,The Sabres’ Losing Streak Ends at 18,"The Buffalo Sabres started the year seeking to ignite their offense with new acquisitions, but instead they found ignominy with a historic losing streak. .The Sabres lost 18 games in a row before slamming the brakes on their skid with a resounding 6-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday. .Those 18 losses matched those accumulated by the 2003-4 Pittsburgh Penguins, who previously had the undesirable distinction of having lost more games consecutively than any other team. .Goalie Linus Ullmark had 31 saves, and defenseman Brandon Montour blew the contest open with an empty-net goal and then a superb individual effort that gave him two short-handed scores in the span of 37 seconds as the Sabres tightened their grip on the game late. .“You never want to lose,” said Montour, who praised his team’s positivity through the streak. “Especially the streak we had there, everybody was talking about it, there was always something to say.” .Injuries have played a role: Buffalo was without the scoring forward Jack Eichel, who last played on March 7, toward the middle of the slump. .Without Eichel, their captain, the Sabres sought leadership by committee, and many players were vocal on Wednesday, Don Granato, the interim coach, said. The team had squandered a three-goal lead against Philadelphia in the third period on Monday, so Granato allowed his players to speak during the second intermission rather than making strategic adjustments or offering his own thoughts. .“We thought it was best just to hand it to them,” Granato said. “It’s your third period, not ours, and you know what to do.” .What they did was end a slide that had lasted more than a month. Here are some of the highlights: .The losing streak (0-15-3), which began on Feb. 25 with an overtime loss to the Devils, was equal parts woe and “whoa,” as the Sabres were abjectly bad at times and imaginatively so at others. .The Sabres nearly broke their free fall on Monday, when they took a 3-0 lead at home against the Flyers. But the Flyers evened the score in the third period before defenseman Ivan Provorov capped Philadelphia’s comeback with a goal 42 seconds into overtime. .“We haven’t been in this situation — we got panicked,” defenseman Rasmus Dahlin said in a video news conference. “The puck bounces their way, and — I don’t know.” .Montour was even more blunt in his assessment, saying that any team in the N.H.L. should have won a game it had led by 3-0, much less a team as desperate for a victory as Buffalo. .Whether or not that was the nadir of the streak may be a matter of debate. .The Sabres closed February by being shut out in back-to-back games against Philadelphia, another of the worst defensive teams this season. .Between March 4 and March 11, the Sabres allowed five goals in each of five consecutive games, which was as close as they had come to defensive consistency. .They followed that up with two more shutout losses, falling to the to the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals by an aggregate score of 9-0. They were shut out five times over all and were outscored, 75-30, as they plummeted to the bottom of the league standings. .The disparities between eras make the official record-keeping and bar-stool arguments a bit messy. .Starting with the implementation of the shootout in the 2005-6 season, the N.H.L. eliminated ties. The 2003-4 Penguins, who also lost 18 in a row (0-17-1), played in the final season before shootouts, but the league had a system, as it does today, that awarded teams a point in the standings for reaching overtime even if they lost. .Technically, the N.H.L. considers overtime losses and shootout losses to be equivalent to ties for historical purposes, as any of the three results would yield a point in the standings. Furthermore, for much of the league’s history, any game that would have gone to overtime or a shootout under current rules would have instead ended in a tie, as there was no regular-season overtime period between 1942 and 1983. .In ., the longest losing streaks, at 17 regulation games, belong to the 1974-75 Washington Capitals and the 1992-93 San Jose Sharks. The Sabres’ longest string of regulation losses was nine, and the 18 straight defeats are considered a “winless streak.” .The  . belongs to the Winnipeg Jets franchise, today’s Arizona Coyotes. They were the class of the World Hockey Association, as the only franchise to win three Avco Cups, but their early days in the N.H.L. were dreadful. In 1980-81, their second N.H.L. campaign, they went winless for 30 games, losing 23 and tying seven times. .But there seems to be little question that the Sabres’ slump will bring further infamy to a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2011, hasn’t won a postseason series since 2007, hasn’t made the finals since 1999 and has never won the Stanley Cup over its 50-season history. .The Sabres made an outside-the-box coaching hire before last season by selecting Ralph Krueger, who had coached the Edmonton Oilers in 2012-13 but had spent the previous five years as the chairman of an English Premier League soccer club. The team fired him on March 17, when the skid had reached a dozen losses, and made Granato the interim coach. Krueger had taken over a team that started strong in 2018-19 and then did so again under him in 2019-20, only to fall off as those campaigns progressed. .Before this season, they had hoped to make the most of an offense that already featured top picks turned stars like Eichel and Dahlin. They added Taylor Hall, the most sought-after forward in free agency and the 2018 most valuable player, on a one-year contract. They also traded for the veteran center Eric Staal, who led the Carolina Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup victory and scored 100 points in 2006 and experienced a resurgence with the Minnesota Wild. .The day Krueger was fired, General Manager Kevyn Adams all but heaved Hall onto the trade block. Staal was traded nine days later, with 50 percent of his remaining salary retained, in exchange for two middle-round draft picks. .No Sabre who has played in at least 15 games this season has a positive plus-minus rating, and as of Wednesday evening, the four worst ratings in the N.H.L. belonged to Buffalo players, including Dahlin’s league-worst negative 33. Staal and Hall combined for 28 points, while the production of Dahlin and another offensive-minded defenseman, Rasmus Ristolainen, has also flagged considerably. .The former all-star wingers Jeff Skinner and Kyle Okposo have combined for a meager 13 points this season, despite counting for $15 million and around 18 percent of the salary cap. Okposo has been hindered by health issues, but Skinner’s even more underwhelming performance has come two seasons after he scored 40 goals for the Sabres. .As a team, Buffalo is tied with the Anaheim Ducks and the Devils for the second-fewest goals scored and is near the bottom in goals allowed.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/hockey/sabres-losing-streak-ends.html
39,,"WASHINGTON — Major League Baseball sailed through roughly six weeks of spring training without any major coronavirus disruptions, but just hours before first pitches were set to be thrown across the country, the problem lurched up again. .The Mets’ season-opening game against the Washington Nationals was postponed on Thursday because of at least three positive coronavirus tests among the Nationals players and because several other players were determined to have been close contacts with the initial individual who tested positive, which requires them to be isolated as well. .M.L.B. issued a statement Thursday saying that the game was postponed “because of ongoing contact tracing involving members of the Nationals organization. Out of an abundance of caution, the game will not be made up on Friday.” .The delay means the Mets and their fans will have to wait at least a few more days to see Francisco Lindor, their new superstar shortstop who just agreed to a  ., make his Mets debut. .Mets Manager Luis Rojas said he was “pretty optimistic” the game would be played Saturday. .“This is not a surprise,” Rojas said. “We have been in situations like this last year. Health is still the No. 1 thing in the world. We are taking care of ourselves and everyone is still wearing their masks everywhere and we are doing what we need to do to make sure that we are protecting each other.” .Jacob deGrom of the Mets had been slated to start Thursday’s game against Max Scherzer of the Nationals in a matchup of Cy Young Award winners. They will likely keep those assignments for whenever the game ends up being played. .On Wednesday, Mike Rizzo, Washington’s general manager, said that five players and one staff member were already ruled out of Thursday’s game. On Thursday, Rizzo confirmed that there were at least three positive tests and one other that is likely to end up as a positive. .The original positive test came from a round of testing done on Monday, the last day of spring training for the Nationals. Following that game, the team flew back to Washington. Rizzo said he was alerted to the positive test after 1 a.m. on Wednesday. .Last year, dozens of games were postponed after outbreaks on various teams, resulting in complicated rescheduling plans, with many teams playing multiple doubleheaders across the sport. This year, M.L.B. had wanted to postpone the season a month to allow more time for players and staff members to get vaccinated and for virus infection rates to drop around the country, but were unable to gain approval of the plan from the players’ union. .M.L.B. has offered to relax coronavirus restrictions on teams once 85 percent of players and staff members are fully vaccinated.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/mets-nationals-postponed-coronavirus.html
40,"Bibian Mentel, Champion Paralympic Snowboarder, Dies at 48","Bibian Mentel, a champion Dutch snowboarder who lost her lower right leg to cancer, then returned to the sport a few months later and dominated it for the next 16 years, died on Monday at her home in Loosdrecht, the Netherlands. She was 48. .After losing her leg, Ms. Mentel had continued to struggle with cancer throughout her career, and in March she announced that it had spread to her brain and was inoperable. Her death was confirmed by a representative of her nonprofit organization,  .. .Ms. Mentel, a steely-eyed competitor who won gold medals at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Paralympic Games, was widely considered among the best snowboarders in the world. She was also a celebrity in the Netherlands, where her athletic achievements, inspirational life story and natural sense of poise and glamour made her the subject of fashion-magazine cover articles and television profiles. .“Thank you for everything you have given and shared with us,” Prince Constantijn, the younger brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands,  .. “Everyone you touched with your optimism and persistence has become a better person.” .Ms. Mentel was already a six-time Dutch champion in the halfpipe and snowboard cross events when she injured her right ankle while training for the 2002 Winter Olympics. Doctors found a tumor on her tibia — a recurrence of a cancer that had first appeared in 1999. They removed her right leg below her knee in 2001. .She was told she wouldn’t snowboard again. But she was soon back on the slopes, and seven months after her surgery she won a gold medal at the Dutch snowboarding championships. .Ms. Mentel continued to compete, and win, in para snowboarding events, even as her cancer reappeared in 2004, this time in her lungs. Over the next 11 years doctors performed five operations, each time removing a bit of lung. .She joined several other para snowboarders in successfully lobbying the International Paralympic Committee to add their sport to the Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. She carried the flag for the Netherlands at the opening ceremony and captured a gold medal in snowboard cross. .Her cancer returned in 2016; this time doctors said there was nothing they could do. She went home and told her husband, Edwin Spee, and her children that she would die soon. Mr. Spee began searching for alternatives, and soon found a doctor with an advanced treatment. .It worked, but the next year doctors found cancer yet again, this time in her neck. Though they were able to push it into remission, the treatment greatly weakened her neck vertebrae, and one of them had to be replaced with a titanium prosthesis — “my permanent jewelry,” she would joke. .The back-to-back bouts with cancer kept her out of competition for many months, and most of her sponsors dropped her. She had to rely on crowdfunding to get to the 2018 Winter Paralympic Games, in Pyeongchang, South Korea. .Once again she carried the Dutch flag in the opening ceremony, and once again she won gold — twice, in the banked slalom and again in snowboard cross. .“I heard a rumor that she has 128 gold medals in her house, and I don’t think that’s an exaggeration,” said Amy Purdy, an American para snowboarder, in  . with Ms. Mentel. “I have traveled the world and competed with her for my entire snowboarding career, and she has won gold every single time.” .Bibian Karina Mentel was born on Sept. 27, 1972, in Utrecht, the Netherlands, the daughter of Theo Mentel, a contractor, and Maude Meijlink. .She is survived by her mother; her husband; a son from a previous relationship, Julian van de Kamp; two stepdaughters, Laila and Annabella Spee; and a half sister, Jody Mentel. .Ms. Mentel studied law for a year before becoming a professional snowboarder. She received a degree in sports management from the Randstad Topsport Academy in 2004 and a master’s in sports management from the Johan Cruyff Institute in 2014. She retired from snowboarding in 2018 to focus on her nonprofit, which helps children with disabilities compete in sports. .During surgery after yet another recurrence of cancer in 2018, Ms. Mentel lost feeling in her lower body. She began using a wheelchair — and  . in the Dutch version of “Dancing With the Stars.” .“As an athlete, it’s a funny thing — people look up to you, put you on a pedestal, think you’re capable of doing anything,” she said during  ., just before her surgery. “A week later, suddenly you’re disabled, and now people were telling me what I could not do. And this made me really rebellious. Because, let’s be honest: The more people were telling me what I could not do, the more I wanted to prove them wrong.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/bibian-mentel-dead.html
41,"In Tennis, Tough Decisions as Players Adjust to Shrunken Paydays","Lloyd Harris has been on a bit of a roll this year. .It’s a good thing, too, because if the 24-year-old from South Africa weren’t, he might be having a hard time breaking even as a professional tennis player these days. Even with his recent success — which includes making the third round of the Australian Open in February, the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships last month, and the second round at the Miami Open last week — his earnings are hardly the windfall they might have been, because prize money in his sport has been substantially downsized during the coronavirus pandemic and expenses are higher than ever. .Harris,  ., probably will not be able to go home until November. So he has to support himself on the road and pay for his usual coaching and physiotherapy, expenses that can run into the high six figures for a player of his caliber. .“It was definitely tough last year,” Harris said last week after a tight first-round win over Emilio Nava. “This year, with the prize money being so reduced, it can really be a struggle.” .Professional tennis may be the most economically top-heavy sport in the world. The best players are fabulously wealthy, in part because of lavish endorsement deals, and any player ranked in the top 30 lives very well. .For those ranked between roughly 40th and 70th, a bad few months can cause serious problems. Life for those outside the top 80, and especially outside the top 100, can be precarious. .The pandemic has made things more challenging, as cuts in prize money at most tournaments make each win more essential for players fighting for the extra cash that comes with making each successive round. .At the Miami Open, which concludes this weekend, more than 200 players have been vying for $6.7 million. That is among the largest prize purses outside the Grand Slam events and the tour finals, but it is down nearly 60 percent from 2019, when the purse was $16.7 million. .Heading into the season, the men’s and women’s tours worked with the players and tournament executives to figure out how to share revenues in an environment where only a fraction of the usual number of tickets can be sold. .The professional tours have tried to structure prize payments so that players eliminated in the early rounds can still make a decent wage. .In Miami, making the second round yielded $16,000 for a player this year compared with nearly $30,000 in 2019, the previous time the tournament took place. The winners will receive just over $300,000, a healthy payday but down nearly 80 percent from 2019. The tours are helping smaller tournaments avoid deficits by funding prize purses through broadcast rights deals and cash reserves. .“It’s obviously a very challenging period of time for everybody,” said Steve Simon, chief executive of the women’s professional tour, the W.T.A. “Our approach was how do we manage this so we have prize money levels in a manner that would support players and make sure our events can operate.” .No one needs to take up a collection for players who advance deep into tournaments, but the economics of being a solid professional tennis player can be challenging. .Depending on the country where a player lives, roughly 50 percent of income can go to taxes. A decent coach demands $50,000 to $100,000 a year plus travel costs. Fitness training and physiotherapy over an 11-month season can cost an additional tens of thousands of dollars. .Danielle Collins, the 27-year-old American  ., trained with a four-person team before the pandemic — a tennis coach, a hitting partner, a physiotherapist and a fitness coach. With the cuts in prize money, though, Collins is now training largely with her boyfriend, Tom Couch, who is her fitness coach. .“We don’t have an organization that pays for coaches, and physios and nutritionists like we would if we were on a team,” she said. “We have financial responsibilities that we are 100 percent committed to. Having to manage through that with the pandemic and ongoing uncertainty and with the prize money reductions, it’s taken a toll.” .Also, travel this year figures to be more expensive, given the restrictions and quarantine rules that can change from week to week and country to country. .This month the professional tours will shift to the clay- and grass-court seasons in Europe until mid-July. In typical years, players might return home several times during that period, especially if they lose early in one tournament and have a two-week lag until the start of the next event on their schedules. That might prove difficult this year. .“If you can get to Europe, you might just want to stay there,” said  ., a 20-year-old American who recently broke into the top 100. .Housing abroad is complicated. When players are eliminated from a tournament, they lose their free lodging until the next tournament starts. .And the pandemic presents more than logistical challenges. .“We’re always at risk of contracting the virus and being in a  .” said John Isner, a veteran player from the United States. “To do that in an environment where the money is much less is very risky on our part.” .There is little choice but to keep competing. Endorsement contracts are often laden with incentives that require players to enter a minimum number of tournaments and earn rankings points by advancing. Collins said these deals — New Balance and Babolat are her main sponsors — had helped sustain many players during the past year. .“For players outside of top 100, they might have opportunities to play, but they are losing money by playing,” she said. .Harris had to default his second-round match in Miami. In the coming weeks, he plans to use Dubai as a kind of base camp, because if he returned to his home in South Africa, where the virus has been prevalent, he couldn’t be sure which countries would permit him to enter later. .He has won nearly $300,000 in prize money this year, bringing his career total to $1.5 million. That may sound like a lot, but Harris turned professional in 2016. He spent far more than he earned during his first four seasons. He was fortunate that his two sponsors, Lotto and Yonex, remained loyal as he grinded through the lower-tier tournaments. .Now, after a busy winter, he is trying to set aside his desire for a break, particularly from the restrictions players must follow while competing. .“Most of the guys on tour have been very selective about where they can play,” Harris said. .But he is finally winning more than losing at the top level. He is climbing the rankings and making decent money. For better or for worse, after a short break, he plans to play on.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/tennis/tennis-atp-wta-money.html
42,"With New Wrinkle, N.H.L. Division Races Heat Up","There’s a lot that is different about the N.H.L. schedule this season. .Start with the compressed timeline, requiring 868 regular-season games to be played in 119 days. Then there are the numerous Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, with more added since the season started. And due to the postponements and shutdowns, schedules have been in near-constant flux, wreaking havoc on practices and planning. .Yet there’s widespread agreement that this season’s scheduling format, which mostly features two-game series in the same city with a day off in between, and the geography-driven divisional alignment, has enlivened what typically is a grueling slog to the Stanley Cup playoffs. .“If you could put fans in the building,” Winnipeg Coach Paul Maurice said, “I would love for it to be like this forever.” .As teams approach the final 20 games of the regular season, and races to gain playoff position by finishing in the top four of each division intensify, this year’s schedule provides another bonus. The exclusively intradivisional play makes each contest a four-point game and provides the potential for quick climbs or slides in the standings. .In its 10 games starting March 11, Nashville went 7-3, including a five-game winning streak, to move from sixth place in the Central Division into a tie for fourth. After beating the Rangers on March 4, Philadelphia was tied for second place in the East Division with 27 points. Going into its game Wednesday, the Flyers had fallen to fifth, three points out of a playoff spot. .“You can’t afford to lose two or three in a row, and everyone knows that,” Winnipeg forward Pierre-Luc DuBois said. .DuBois added: “It’s just part of the fun challenge this year.” .With such volatility in the standings, the challenge for general managers, especially as the April 12 trade deadline approaches, is determining which clubs are buyers and which are sellers. .“I think teams are a little more reluctant to shake the tree, as it were, than they normally are,” Minnesota General Manager Bill Guerin said in a video news conference Wednesday. “Speaking for us, we’re keeping team chemistry in mind because we have good team chemistry and the guys are playing well together. So do you upset that? It’s still pretty quiet out there.” .The games themselves have more energy and intensity, Maurice said, partly because of the reduced travel. .Last season, Boston was in a division with Florida and Tampa Bay. This year, the Bruins’ most distant opponents are Pittsburgh and Buffalo, and travel between the others — Washington, Philadelphia, the Devils, the Rangers and the Islanders, has been done by train or bus. .This season, Vancouver has to make three trips instead of one, to play games in Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa. But in all three cases it is scheduled to play two multi-game series and return home, rather than remain on the road as part of a longer trip, dramatically lessening travel demands. .“There’s times in the normal schedule where a team’s coming in, they’ve played the night before, and they get in at four in the morning, so that’s a big advantage to us,” Detroit Coach Jeff Blashill said. “Now, for the most part, we’re all in the same boat, so travel becomes less of a factor.” .Players also like the ability to focus on an opponent for more than one night. Teams have had to make more adjustments, Flyers forward Travis Konecny said. .“It’s about adapting and surprising the other team with different stuff every night, and they’re doing the same thing to us, so it’s fun,” he said. .Geography has created new rivalries and intensified others. The teams in the United States now play each other eight times, while the seven Canadian teams play four teams nine times and two teams 10 times. .Carolina, which was in the Metropolitan Division last season, is in the same division as Florida and Tampa Bay this year, and all three teams are bunched at the top of the Central. .“There are some guys you’re not going to like more than others on back-to-back nights,” Carolina forward Brett Pesce said. .Before this season, the last time N.H.L. teams played each other three straight times was in 2012-13. Already there have been a few four-game series — a league first. And from Feb. 2 to 15, the Coyotes and Blues played seven straight times because of Covid-related postponements that required schedule shuffling. The teams split the first six games, and Arizona’s Clayton Keller scored the only goal in the seventh. .“It was a fun series,” Keller said. “Almost every game was tight, and it had a playofflike atmosphere.” .Carolina played four straight games against Tampa Bay in February and finished a four-game set with Columbus on March 25, losing the first two games at home and winning the last two on the road. .For Hurricanes forward Jordan Martinook, no series against a single opponent is too long. .“Looking back to October and November, when we were thinking we might not even be playing a season, I don’t care if we play one team 56 times,” he said. “As long as you’re playing N.H.L. games, you can’t take it for granted. I’m just happy we’re playing.” .During a news conference on March 11, N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league would return to its former divisional alignment next season. He did, however, leave open the option to tweak the schedule to allow for more intradivisional play as well as back-to-back games, which would please Blashill. .“I think it’s very, very difficult to beat the same team twice in a row,” said Blashill, a former college and American Hockey League coach. “I saw that going back to my college hockey background, and we had that in the A.H.L. as well. It makes for very competitive games night in and night out.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/hockey/nhl-division-races-trade-deadline.html

44,Justice Dept. Inquiry Into Matt Gaetz Said to Be Focused on Cash Paid to Women,"WASHINGTON — A Justice Department investigation into Representative Matt Gaetz and an indicted Florida politician is focusing on their involvement with multiple women who were recruited online for sex and received cash payments, according to people close to the investigation and text messages and payment receipts reviewed by The New York Times. .Investigators believe Joel Greenberg, the former tax collector in Seminole County, Fla., who was indicted last year on a federal sex trafficking charge and other crimes, initially met the women through websites that connect people who go on dates in exchange for gifts, fine dining, travel and allowances, according to three people with knowledge of the encounters. Mr. Greenberg introduced the women to Mr. Gaetz, who also had sex with them, the people said. .One of the women who had sex with both men also agreed to have sex with an unidentified associate of theirs in Florida Republican politics, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Greenberg had initially contacted her online and introduced her to Mr. Gaetz, the person said. .Mr. Gaetz denied ever paying a woman for sex. .The Justice Department inquiry  . whether Mr. Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old girl and whether she received anything of material value, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The sex trafficking count against Mr. Greenberg involved the same girl, according to two people briefed on the investigation. .The authorities have also investigated whether other men connected to Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg had sex with the 17-year-old, two of the people said. .Mr. Gaetz, 38, was elected to Congress in 2016 and became one of President Donald J. Trump’s most outspoken advocates. .The Times has reviewed receipts from Cash App, a mobile payments app, and Apple Pay that show payments from Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg to one of the women, and a payment from Mr. Greenberg to a second woman. The women told their friends that the payments were for sex with the two men, according to two people familiar with the conversations. .In encounters during 2019 and 2020, Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg instructed the women to meet at certain times and places, often at hotels around Florida, and would tell them the amount of money they were willing to pay, according to the messages and interviews. .One person said that the men also paid in cash, sometimes withdrawn from a hotel ATM. .Some of the men and women took ecstasy, an illegal mood-altering drug, before having sex, including Mr. Gaetz, two people familiar with the encounters said. .In some cases, Mr. Gaetz asked women to help find others who might be interested in having sex with him and his friends, according to two people familiar with those conversations. Should anyone inquire about their relationships, one person said, Mr. Gaetz told the women to say that he had paid for hotel rooms and dinners as part of their dates. .The F.B.I. has questioned multiple women involved in the encounters, including as recently as January, to establish details of their relationships with Mr. Gaetz and his friends, according to text messages and two people familiar with the interviews. .No charges have been brought against Mr. Gaetz, and the extent of his criminal exposure is unclear. Mr. Gaetz’s office issued a statement on Thursday night in a response to a request for comment. .“Matt Gaetz has never paid for sex,” the statement said. “Matt Gaetz refutes all the disgusting allegations completely. Matt Gaetz has never ever been on any such websites whatsoever. Matt Gaetz cherishes the relationships in his past and looks forward to marrying the love of his life.” .A lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, Fritz Scheller, declined to comment, as did a Justice Department spokesman. .It is not illegal to provide adults with free hotel stays, meals and other gifts, but if prosecutors think they can prove that the payments to the women were for sex, they could accuse Mr. Gaetz of trafficking the women under “force, fraud or coercion.” For example, prosecutors have filed trafficking charges against people suspected of providing drugs in exchange for sex because feeding another person’s drug habit could be seen as a form of coercion. .It is also a violation of federal child sex trafficking law to provide someone under 18 with anything of value in exchange for sex, which can include meals, hotels, drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. A conviction carries a 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence. .The investigation stems from the Justice Department’s continuing inquiry into Mr. Greenberg, who potentially faces decades in prison on three dozen charges. The U.S. attorney’s office in Central Florida initially secured an indictment against Mr. Greenberg in June, alleging that he had stalked a political rival and had used his elected office to create fake identification cards. .During the investigation, the authorities discovered evidence that prompted them to broaden it, and Mr. Greenberg  . in August on the sex trafficking charge. .One of the sites the men met women through was called Seeking Arrangement, which  . as a place where wealthy people find attractive companions and pamper them “with fine dinners, exotic trips and allowances.” The site’s founder has said it has  .. The F.B.I. mentioned the website in a conversation with at least one potential witness, according to a person familiar with the conversation. .Mr. Greenberg was indicted this week  ., accusing him of submitting false claims to receive pandemic relief aid from the government and trying to bribe a government official. The authorities said Mr. Greenberg undertook those efforts after he was initially indicted last summer. .Mr. Greenberg, who has pleaded not guilty to the earlier charges, is scheduled to go on trial in June. He was sent to jail in March for violating the terms of his bail. .Mr. Gaetz said this week that his lawyers had been in touch with the Justice Department and that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. Subjects of investigations are often witnesses or people who might have information that could help the government pursue its targets. But it is common for that designation to shift over the course of an investigation. .“I only know that it has to do with women,” Mr. Gaetz said. “I have a suspicion that someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.” .Mr. Gaetz, a lawyer, was first elected to the House representing the Florida Panhandle at age 34. The son of a former president of the Florida State Senate, Mr. Gaetz attended Florida State University and William & Mary Law School before serving in the Florida State Legislature. .Mr. Gaetz has sought to divert attention from the Justice Department investigation by claiming that he and his father were the targets of an extortion plot by two men trying to secure funding for a separate venture. .The men — Robert Kent, a former Air Force intelligence officer who runs a consulting business, and Stephen Alford, a real estate developer who has been convicted of fraud — approached Mr. Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, about funding their efforts to locate Robert A. Levinson, an American hostage held in Iran. They suggested to Don Gaetz that Mr. Levinson’s successful return could somehow be used to secure a pardon for Matt Gaetz if he were charged with federal crimes, according to a copy of their proposal provided to The Times. .Soon after, Don Gaetz hired a lawyer and contacted the F.B.I. Matt Gaetz said his father wore a wire and taped a meeting and a telephone conversation with Mr. Alford. An email exchange between Don Gaetz’s lawyer and the Justice Department provided to The Times appears to confirm he was generally cooperating with the F.B.I. as it looked into his claims. .Mr. Kent denied the Gaetzes’ assertions. He said he had heard rumors that Matt Gaetz might be under investigation and mentioned them only to sweeten his proposal. “I told him I’m not trying to extort, but if this were true, he might be interested in doing something good,” Mr. Kent said in an interview. .Last year, the Trump administration  ., a former F.B.I. agent, that he had died while in captivity in Iran, where he disappeared in 2007 while on an unauthorized mission for the C.I.A. .But some people involved with the Levinson case continued to believe that he might still be alive, including Mr. Kent. .He was stunned when he heard that Matt Gaetz had sought to tie the Justice Department investigation to an extortion plot related to the Levinson case. .“He threw Levinson and the entire Levinson family under the bus,” Mr. Kent said. “I can’t imagine what these poor people have been through.

45,,"As his Yankees teammates watched Giancarlo Stanton rocket ball after ball out of the batter’s box, day after day during spring training, it often felt like October again. Stanton was happy and healthy then, crushing home run after home run while  . of the American League Championship Series. .“My gosh, I mean the home runs he was hitting weren’t just home runs but light-tower home runs,” Yankees first baseman Luke Voit said, adding: “The only problem is that I hit behind him and when he hits those balls so far, I’m like, ‘All right, I’ve got to do the same thing.’ And I ended up striking out.” .Stanton has not always looked or felt that good since the Miami Marlins offloaded him and his huge contract onto the Yankees after his award-winning 2017 season. Because of  ., Stanton, one of the fittest and strongest players in baseball, has appeared in roughly half of his team’s games since his move to New York. And when he was in the lineup during past postseasons, he  ., either. .That changed last season, as did his leadership role within the team on important social issues. And now, fresh off that big October, he is looking for an even bigger year. .“He looks great,” Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said after watching Stanton one day this spring. “He looks like he hasn’t really skipped a beat from what I remember him being last October.” .The Yankees — a favorite to contend for the World Series title, a crown that has eluded them since 2009 — have many stars. There is pitcher  ., the ace who will start opening day on Thursday against the Toronto Blue Jays. There is  ., the Yankees’ best all-around player and the  . last season. And there are outfielder Aaron Judge, closer Aroldis Chapman, shortstop Gleyber Torres and others. .“Our success is tied to some of our big boys really thriving,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said recently. .There are few bigger boys in baseball than Stanton, 31, a designated hitter listed at 6-foot-6 and 245 pounds, and the only current Yankees player with a Most Valuable Player Award on his résumé. In the past, Stanton’s size has sometimes worked against him. Since hitting 38 home runs and driving in 100 runs in 158 games of his first regular season with the Yankees, in 2018, Stanton has played in only 41 regular-season games. His list of physical ailments since is long: a biceps strain, a balky shoulder,  ., a sprained knee, a strained quadriceps and a pulled hamstring. .“It hasn’t been fun,” Stanton said recently. He knows people inside baseball and out question his durability, just as he knows the only way to dump that label is to play. “You got to be out there on the field,” he said, “if you don’t want questions.” .So after an injury-marred 2019 season, Stanton said he had lost roughly 20 pounds — an attempt to return to the weight of his healthier, most productive years. But that didn’t do the trick: Stanton was limited, again, appearing in only 23 of the Yankees’ 60 games in the truncated 2020 regular season. . He significantly altered his workout regimen this winter and lifted weights less often, the Yankees’ director of player health and performance, Eric Cressey, told  .. The result, Stanton said, has been improved agility and, he hopes, better odds of staying on the field. .Stanton’s father, Mike, said that the injuries had been the low points of his son’s career, which has included four All-Star selections and 312 career home runs. “He wants nothing more than to be out there contributing,” Mike Stanton said in a phone interview this week. .Even while on the injured list last year, Stanton contributed in valuable ways. As  . that was consuming the nation reached into Major League Baseball clubhouses, Stanton, one of the quieter players on the Yankees, stood front and center during several team meetings on the subject, teammates and team officials said. .He shared stories about his experience as a biracial man in America, spoke about growing up in Los Angeles mere blocks from where Rodney King was beaten by the police in 1991, and made clear his thoughts about what needed to change. In a sport with relatively few Black American players, Stanton was also one of the few people who regularly knelt during the national anthem. .“It was cool that he was speaking out, because there are people in that room that have never experienced anything like others have,” said Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier, who is white. .“And when he was speaking out and he was talking about things that he had experienced, and others were talking about it, it really pulls at your heartstrings. And it made you realize the way that these guys compartmentalize some of the things that happened in their everyday life versus what’s happening at the field.” .Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a phone interview that Stanton’s physical strength had always been apparent. But as protests and difficult discussions about race swept the country, Cashman added, Stanton “rose to the occasion, and that inner strength showed up from Day 1.” .“It needed to be done,” Stanton said. .Stanton, whose  . were African-American and Puerto Rican, said what he saw in the country last year reminded him of what his grandmother and mother used to tell him that they experienced. While speaking up, Stanton said, he simply wanted the people around him to learn more about the issues. .He said he cared little if his words and actions led others to label him a team leader or not, and this winter he made clear he planned to stay a Yankee by passing up the opportunity to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract, which has seven years and a guaranteed $218 million remaining. .Given his injury history, it would be tough for Stanton to top that guaranteed money as a free agent, and he has emphasized that he wants to win a World Series with the Yankees. Stanton now hopes that, at least for the next eight months, his body will cooperate. .Boone has predicted “a huge season” for Stanton if the Yankees can help him stay on the field. A reason for his bullishness: Boone argued that Stanton was a better hitter now than he was in his M.V.P. season, in 2017, when he smashed 59 home runs and drove in 132 runs. .Stanton concurred, citing his improved approach at the plate (his walk rate was up the past two seasons). He said he had done eye training over the years. Last October, he tied a Yankees record with six home runs in a single postseason. .“When he’s healthy, he is one of the best players in the game,” Cashman said. “That has never been in dispute. And if anybody had questions to whether he could be the same type of player when healthy in the postseason, he showed that as well last year.” .The key for Stanton will be showing it during a marathon baseball season. There are hints that will be possible. During a recent batting practice in Florida, Stanton and Judge were back to clobbering balls over the fence. As he left the cage, Frazier sidled up to Stanton and asked, “Don’t you feel like you should be on a field that’s bigger than the one that you’re on right now?” .Stanton agreed. The Yankees will be happy simply to have him on the field.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/baseball/yankees-giancarlo-stanton-opening-day.html
46,Women’s Basketball Coaches Challenge N.C.A.A. Leaders Over Gender Inequity,"Top coaches in women’s college basketball pressed N.C.A.A. executives directly on Wednesday over what they have judged as chronic failures to promote and support the sport — longstanding tensions that have now ignited a public furor over  .. .“We’re going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we don’t really step up to the plate at the N.C.A.A. as a whole to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,” Nell Fortner of Georgia Tech told N.C.A.A. President Mark Emmert as coaches who have spent years leading teams through deep postseason runs watched. .The roughly 70-minute videoconference, which the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association organized and The New York Times viewed, came as the N.C.A.A. has struggled to move past criticism of its management of women’s basketball, which has grown into a greater force in college athletics. The unequal facilities at this year’s men’s and women’s competitions, coaches and executives alike have acknowledged, are only symptoms of deeper concerns about gender equity and whether the N.C.A.A. has unfairly prioritized the hugely profitable men’s tournament over the money-losing women’s competition. .Emmert told the coaches that the association recognized it had “some serious work to do” around women’s basketball and that “there’s no question that we dropped the ball, that we had some serious misses” around the 2021 women’s tournament, which will culminate Sunday night with the championship game in San Antonio. .“We’ve got to make sure that when we have our championships around our two marquee sports — the sports that more people watch than anything else — that we put on display the kind of equity that we all aspire to, and we sure as heck didn’t do that this year,” Emmert said. .College sports officials have said that the coronavirus pandemic posed  . for this year’s tournaments. But some of women’s basketball’s leading figures used Wednesday’s meeting to argue bluntly to top officials that the very structure of the N.C.A.A. — like its organization chart and  . — had contributed to long-term inequities. .The vice president of women’s basketball, for example, is not a member of Emmert’s senior management team; the association’s vice president of basketball, whose attention is largely directed toward the men’s tournament, is. .Dan Gavitt, the vice president of basketball, also acknowledged Wednesday that a dozen employees are dedicated to the men’s tournament, on which the N.C.A.A. is financially dependent, while six are focused on the women’s competition. .“As leaders, I think we have to bear the responsibility for anything that goes wrong in our organization,” Muffet McGraw, who won two national titles at Notre Dame before her retirement last year, told Emmert. “In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio — this is way deeper than that.” .Other coaches soon ticked through their own worries. .Geno Auriemma, Connecticut’s coach, warned that the university chancellors and presidents who have enormous influence over the N.C.A.A. and will play crucial roles in approving meaningful reforms “bring their biases from their own campuses.” .Dawn Staley of South Carolina challenged Emmert’s decision to  . instead of appointing a group that might be more independent. .U.C.L.A.’s Cori Close questioned why the association distributes money to conferences based on performances in the men’s tournament but not the women’s, and Fortner wondered why the N.C.A.A. had not made more use of its financial and marketing might to support the women’s game. .Fortner noted, for instance, that the men’s tournament had courts that amounted to “eye candy” for casual television viewers, potentially drawing them in as they toggled through channels, while many of the women’s games were played on floors that did little to suggest the gravity of the competition. .“If you were flipping through the TV to find the women’s tournament, you would not have stayed on the game,” she said, “because you might have thought it was a high school game.” .But during his exchanges with Fortner on Wednesday, Emmert suggested that N.C.A.A. officials were contemplating expanding the use of its March Madness brand, which is synonymous with men’s basketball, to include the women’s tournament. .“Why isn’t March Madness just plastered everywhere at the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament?” Fortner asked. “It’s not on our floors. It’s not anywhere, and I wonder why. Why not?” .“I think it should be,” Emmert replied. “I want to get to the answer to that question because the truth is, I don’t know.” .Gavitt acknowledged that ESPN, which broadcasts the women’s tournament, would have a voice in the deliberations about how to promote the tournament: “If ESPN is not going to embrace using March Madness in everything they do, is it enhancing the championship to the level that we all think it can? If they will, then I think it’s a great opportunity.” .ESPN declined to comment on Wednesday, but it would likely use whatever branding that the N.C.A.A. chose. .Emmert and the other executives offered little in the way of detailed guarantees to the coaches. Instead, they largely acknowledged concerns, pledged unspecified reforms and insisted that the N.C.A.A. had not deliberately diminished women’s basketball. .“I do believe and have believed all along that women’s basketball and women’s sports is and can be a very powerful social and economic driver,” said Lynn Holzman, a former Kansas State player who is now the vice president of women’s basketball and reports to Gavitt. “Just look at the attention it’s garnered over the last week or so.” .Indeed, the N.C.A.A. has seen its tournaments sometimes overshadowed by the management turmoil around the women’s competition. Wednesday’s apologies were only the latest expressions of regret, especially concerning workout facilities that were flimsily stocked for the women’s tournament in Texas and well-supplied for the men’s event in Indiana. .N.C.A.A. officials had hoped that the outrage surrounding the tournaments would ebb, especially as the competitions advanced to their later rounds. But that seemed to reflect a misjudgment of the frustrations coursing through women’s basketball and, for that matter, the wider college sports industry. .Less than 24 hours before the meeting with Emmert, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the group that convened Wednesday’s call, released a video that challenged the association’s plan to investigate what had happened, much as Staley did on Wednesday. .“We will remain diligent in ensuring that the voice of our member coaches are heard and the best interests of our sport are protected as this much-needed review, whatever form it may ultimately take, begins,” Donehew said. .If the law firm’s review proceeds according to the N.C.A.A.’s timetable, a report is supposed to be made public this summer.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-inequity.html
47,‘Can’t Wait to Be Able to Hold Them’: Players’ Parents in an N.C.A.A. Bubble,"SAN ANTONIO — Michelle Bain-Brink took books and a container of macaroons to her daughter, Cameron, a freshman forward for Stanford, the morning after the team rallied against Louisville on Tuesday to advance to the  .. Bain-Brink fully expected to leave the packages with a security guard who would send them to her daughter’s room in the team hotel. .Coincidentally, Cameron Brink was in the lobby at the same time, delivering a bag for the security guard to give to her mother. .From 20 feet away, through the glass doors of the Marriott Rivercenter hotel in downtown San Antonio, the mother and daughter yelled “hello” and “love you” to one another. .It was their first face-to-face conversation in person over the past three months. .“I got quite emotional, because although I’ve seen her from the stands, seeing her like that, unexpectedly, was really touching,” Bain-Brink, who lives in Oregon, said in an interview on Wednesday. .Bain-Brink and her husband, Greg Brink, are happy just to be here in San Antonio, able to attend their daughter’s games again even though they are not allowed direct contact. Stanford, seeking its first national title since 1992, will meet South Carolina in a semifinal on Friday. .Stanford was especially prepared for the bubblelike environment that players and staff members are enduring at the three-week-long national tournament centered in San Antonio. While the coronavirus pandemic led to restricted attendance at most college competitions, the Stanford team played the bulk of its season as a group of nomads, in strange arenas without fans or family in the stands. .Until the Pac-12 tournament, which Stanford won last month, Cameron Brink’s parents had not watched in person as she competed for the Cardinal, and a year had passed since they last watched one of her games from the stands. .The Cardinal had to spend nine consecutive weeks away from their Northern California campus, because the surrounding Santa Clara County had established coronavirus safety protocols that prohibited contact sports. .Instead the team lived in hotels, periodically practiced in Las Vegas and played “home games” in Santa Cruz, about 45 miles from the Stanford campus. .For parents who had been in the stands for almost every game since their child could hold a basketball, the experience was disorienting. .“You forget what it is like to make eye contact with her as she’s coming off the court going into the locker room,” Bain-Brink said. .When Kiana Williams, a senior on the Stanford team, told her father, Mike Williams, that spectators were going to be allowed at the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas, he “unglued” himself from his chair, he said, and called three relatives. He and his wife left the family home in San Antonio to see their daughter in person for the first time since he dropped her off at Stanford in September, with tears in his eyes. .The conference tournament arrangement felt like winning the lottery, Mike Williams said in an interview on Wednesday. Then he learned about the N.C.A.A.’s  . for this year’s national tournament. .The whole event, rather than just the Final Four, would be held in San Antonio. .“So now we’re on cloud nine, because now we didn’t have to travel and we knew she was going to be here for three weeks,” Williams said. “So we’re just full of joy, just happy. I told the parents in Vegas, since the tournament is going to be in San Antonio, let’s have a big powwow and I’ll barbecue for you.” .He did — the Saturday before  .. Such gatherings have enhanced a bond that the parents developed through video calls and WhatsApp messages this season while watching their children from afar. .“It almost made us closer, when we couldn’t even be around each other, which seems backwards, but it’s something that’s very true,” Jaime Hull, the mother of the twins Lexie and Lacie Hull, said in an interview on Wednesday. “You start having that camaraderie together. Like on game days, parents text back and forth that we’re all sitting in our homes, watching the games and rooting everybody on.” .When they are not watching games from the arena stands, the parents are having their own fun in San Antonio. .The Brinks have been dipping into restaurants recommended by the television show “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,” and the Hulls have been playing a number of card games. .In a hotel about a block away, the Stanford players have found their own diversions — including a Ping-Pong tournament, the champion of which will be crowned on Saturday, Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said on Thursday. .“Hannah has talked about my weaknesses, and I think she’s spot on,” Lexie Hull, one of the Ping-Pong finalists, told reporters on Thursday about having to face her teammate Hannah Jump. “So I expect her to exploit those to the fullest. I want to be very confident going into that game, but I really think she might have a better skill-set, so I’m going to have to come out grittier and just really locked in.” .The parents have said that they can see a benefit of their children having been isolated together. On campus during the pandemic, players lived in apartments near the athletic facilities, limiting whom they would run into in hallways. Stanford was mostly barren, while the few students permitted to be there attended online classes from their residential bubbles. .Leaving campus made the team tighter, Jaime Hull said. .“I see a lot of individuals on teams, and I don’t see a lot of individuals on Stanford,” Jaime Hull said. “They play as a team, they play as a unit. One might be down and someone else might step up, and they are right there having each other’s back.” .Same goes for the parents and the cheering squad. From that 300-person block of friends and family dressed in Cardinal attire — including Russell Wilson, a fairly accomplished football player who is better known in this crowd as the boisterous older brother of guard Anna Wilson — screams of “defense,” “Go Card” and “Ki” accompany the action. .Kiana Williams’s cheering section is upward of 60 people: family, friends and basketball players on the youth team that her father coaches. .The families take their job very seriously. When Stanford was  . in the round of 8, the parents regrouped. .“I felt like I played in the game at the end of that,” Jaime Hull said. “I was so sweaty, and I think my heel is bruised from pounding the bleacher with my foot.” .Of course, playing near a teammate’s home has other perks. On Wednesday evening, Kiana Williams’s brother’s wife’s grandmother wrapped up two pans of homemade lasagna — one with meat and one without — and gave them to Williams’s mother, LaChelle, who drove them to the team’s hotel. She left the lasagna, cooked with love for the players and staff, with some of the credentialed personnel. .“And it was delicious,” VanDerveer said. .While the parents are excited to see their children to play, they are more thrilled about the prospect of having them come home. .“As soon as the game is over and she gets on the bus and goes to the hotel, we’ll be right behind the bus,” Mike Williams said. .“We have these big chair couches,” Greg Brink said of the family home in Oregon, “so a lot of people can climb on them at one time — a lot of cuddling, the dog is going to be jumping on top of this.” .“Win or lose, I don’t care, I just can’t wait to be able to hold them. But they’re going to fight until the end,” Jaime Hull said, acknowledging that the title game on Sunday could delay the reunions. “So I’ll wait until Monday, if that’s what it takes, or Sunday night. I can make it that long.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-tournament-stanford.html
48,,"In late July, as the 2020  . season started amid the pandemic, Colorado Rockies outfielder Ian Desmond found himself standing on his eight-acre property in Sarasota, Fla. .Palmetto bushes had overtaken much of the land. Desmond, who had opted out of the season, was home in the summer for the first time in 12 years. He decided to take on the stubborn fronds. .When he wasn’t working in the yard, he helped his children learn to ride his neighbor’s horses. Desmond’s middle son, Cruz, loved riding so much that he opted out of spring baseball so he could learn to rodeo instead. .“Ian is a person who is always outside, always doing something,” Chelsey Desmond said of her husband. “He doesn’t do well with idle time.” .From August to November, Desmond, 35, helped coach his sons’ youth baseball team (his three sons: Grayson, Cruz and Ashton — 9, 8 and 6 — were on the same squad), which won its first championship. On Sept. 15, the Desmonds welcomed their fifth child, and second daughter, Naomi, into the world. Their daughter Dakota was born in 2019. .Desmond, who hit 20 home runs in 2019 and was an All-Star in 2012 and 2016, took control of his story. In detailing last June why he would not be playing the 2020 season, giving up a prorated salary of $5.5 million, he  . It focused on his experience of growing up biracial and spoke of how the police killing of George Floyd had stirred memories of his own brushes with systemic racism; it also explained his desire to be with his children as they navigated national conversations about racial justice. .His post also included a call to action for himself, which he answered in December, when  ., a charity he helped found that uses baseball as a tool for holistic development for underserved youth in Sarasota. Then, in February, he said he was opting out of the 2021 season “for now” as well. He stands to lose as much as $8 million this time, if he sits out the entire season. .Desmond grew up in Sarasota. His parents met in the Northeast, then moved to Florida before he was born. His mother, Pattie Paradise, is white, and his father, Wesley Desmond, was Black, which did not sit well with his mother’s family, Desmond said. .When he was 18 months, and his sister, Nikki, was 3, their father died unexpectedly. Paradise worked two jobs, sometimes three, to take care of them. She married Chris Charron, who is white, when Ian was 5. (The couple divorced 13 years later.) .The family lived in a mostly white neighborhood. When Nikki and Ian were in elementary school, their mother transferred them to a private, Catholic school, where they were among the few students of color. Ian said he learned later that the school held a meeting with the student body to announce that he and Nikki would be enrolling. “They had to prepare the kids and say, ‘Hey, there are some Black kids coming, biracial kids,’” Desmond said. .Their family didn’t talk a lot about race. Paradise and Charron had two more children. “Our sister is eight years younger than me, and people would ask her, ‘Why do your brother and sister have brown skin?’” Nikki said. .Ian played soccer, with mostly white teammates and opponents. Nikki participated in gymnastics, which was mostly white as well. “It’s fair to say that my sister and I identified as white,” Ian Desmond said. “We knew we were biracial, but we just kind of felt like one with the white community.” .Still, he encountered racial profiling. As a young teenager, he was heading to a Sports Authority when he saw a woman approaching the entrance. He hurried over to hold the door open for her. Instead of thanking him, she clutched her purse. .“I was like, ohhh,” Desmond said. “It was really nothing to me, but at the same time it was like, man, this lady thought I was going to rob her.” .He was never quite sure how to fill out “race” on a questionnaire. Was he white? Yes. Was he Black? Yes. .“The biggest part for me … it’s the identity,” Desmond said. “You think about the literal time where you have to fill out that box. It’s that feeling of being on an island and not knowing which way to paddle off — where are you? Where do you fit?” .Rather than vocalize those questions, he suppressed them. He channeled his energy and emotions into sports, which he approached with a quiet intensity. .Paradise, his mother, was a hairstylist, but she never cut her son’s hair into a fade, which one of his baseball coaches noticed. One afternoon, the coach, who is Black, went to Desmond’s house and gave him his first one. “I remember it was like, ‘Oh my gosh, my first fade!” Desmond said. “OK, now I know!” .When Desmond was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the third round in 2004 at age 18, he found himself most at ease with the Latino players. He still hung out with white and Black players, and became “amphibious,” he said, transforming to be like whichever group he was with. That skill helped him become a leader in clubhouses, with an ability to jump from circle to circle. .“That’s the life of someone who is biracial,” Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer, who is also biracial, said. “It helps you connect with people from different walks of life, not even just race. You’ve always been a little different in your own regard, and you’ve found a way to adapt. It might be a little tough when you’re young, but as you age you realize. That fully helped me.” .When the pandemic truncated spring training in 2020, the Desmonds flew home from Arizona and waited to see what would happen. Baseball writers had reached out to Desmond — one of the few Black American players on the Rockies’ roster — after the killings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. As the racial justice movements around the country grew, Desmond had more conversations and reflected on his experiences more candidly than before. .“That’s when he really started talking about situations that had happened to him that I didn’t know about,” Nikki said. .On May 22, Antwuan Roach, 18, was fatally shot in Washington. Desmond had met Roach through the Washington Nationals’ youth baseball academy, where he mentored and befriended him when he was 12. Roach had earned his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in a job training program. .“That really hit me hard,” Desmond said. “You wonder, ‘Were there other opportunities I may have missed out on to make an impact in his life?’” .Three days later, Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis. Again, reporters reached out. Desmond wanted to respond, but not by holding a news conference where journalists pulled out one or two quotes from a 45-minute session. .He called Amanda Comak Zrebiec, a former Nationals beat writer whom he had befriended, and asked her to help him articulate his thoughts. The two had several video conversations; as he talked, she took notes. The resulting post received over 43,000 likes and numerous comments of appreciation for his candor about being biracial. .Days later, Desmond was talking to a neighbor, Vince Northfield, who had retired from business at age 53. ‘How can I get something started?’ Desmond said. The two began meeting frequently, inside one of their barns, and texted and emailed with ideas when they weren’t together. Northfield paired his business and strategy acumen with Desmond’s vision. .Using the Nationals’ academy as a template, the two men established a partnership with the local Boys & Girls Club. They found facilities, supplies and volunteers and worked within pandemic parameters to plan safe, effective programming. .Newtown Connection, run through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Sarasota and DeSoto Counties, officially began operating this month. Standing on a field in the spring Florida sun, Desmond, Northfield and several volunteer coaches led close to 70 children in physical-education-style games like freeze tag and hula hoop. Using bean bags instead of baseballs, they introduced the game to children, many who had never played it. They described healthy eating habits, handed out snacks of bananas and apples, and talked about the word of the day: “respect.” .The twice-a-week programming will extend through the year (The Player’s Alliance donated bats, balls and gloves, for when the group graduates to using baseballs for drills), and Desmond’s ultimate goal is to create a template that other organizations can replicate around the country in connecting with and positively impacting youth, while also expanding diversity in exposure to baseball. .“You meet people who profess about family or philanthropy, but don’t actually follow through,” Northfield said. “Ian does it for real. It comes from the heart. You can see the way he helps and engages with people.” .Chelsey and Ian Desmond met in the fifth grade. They were a couple, as much as two children are at 11, and “dated” until high school, when they were just friends. (They reconnected as a couple when Ian was in the minors.) On a basketball court one afternoon, Chelsey, who is white, teased him about how cocky he was. She hadn’t been around anyone as confident and hard-working as Ian, she said, and she mistook that for cockiness. “When he sets his mind to do something, there is literally no stopping him,” she said. “He applies that to everything in his life, even if it’s just a tiny goal.” .Another of Desmond’s goals that emerged in 2020 was to encourage conversations about race and culture. He posted more frequently about racial justice on Instagram, whether it was defining racism and oppression or encouraging followers to “eat one meal this weekend in a restaurant on the opposite side of town.” .When Chelsey and Ian Desmond told their oldest son about Floyd’s killing, Grayson wondered if the same thing could happen to him. .“That was like a light bulb moment for us,” she said. “Of course, we want them to learn that it’s not what’s on the outside but what’s on the inside that counts. But avoiding it and not having the conversation is just as bad.” .Nikki and Ian Desmond grew up without any connection to their father’s side of the family, which included their great-aunt Viola Desmond, a Canadian civil rights activist whose image is on the Canadian $10 bill. In the past year, Desmond has reconnected with his father’s family, including his uncle Charles Desmond, chief executive of the largest children’s savings account initiative in Massachusetts and a civic and community organizer. .Learning about his family’s culture and background has helped Desmond shape his own conversations and narratives, as he encourages more thoughtful discussions of inclusivity in baseball and everyday lives. “If we are headed to a world of equality and acceptance and inclusiveness … will our world not be biracial?” Desmond said. .“We need more people like Ian to not only speak up, but to be brave enough to listen,” said Ryan Zimmerman, a former teammate of his whose work with a personal foundation was an inspiration to Desmond. “Ian would legitimately go out to dinner with that person who didn’t agree with him.

Florida and Texas are poised to advance similar legislation. Alabama’s strict voter identification law is  . elsewhere. .As states across the South race to establish new voting restrictions, Virginia is bolting in the opposite direction. The Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, this week capped a multiyear liberal movement for greater ballot access by signing off on sweeping legislation to recreate pivotal elements of the federal Voting Rights Act that were  .. .Alone among the states of the former Confederacy, Virginia has become a voting rights bastion, increasingly encouraging its citizens — especially people of color — to exercise their democratic rights. In the last 14 months, the state’s Democratic-controlled General Assembly and Mr. Northam have together  ., enacted  ., made  . and enacted  . for anyone who receives a Virginia driver’s license. .Virginia, which for nearly 50 years had to submit changes to its elections to the federal government for approval under the Voting Rights Act’s preclearance requirements, has now effectively imposed the same covenants on itself, an extraordinary step for a state with a long history of segregation and racially targeted voting laws. .The new law that was approved on Wednesday, called the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, requires all local elections administrators to receive public feedback or advance approval from the state’s attorney general for changes like moving voting precincts or elections registrars’ offices, and allows voters and the attorney general to sue over voter suppression. It expressly prohibits any racial discrimination or intimidation related to voting. .“I have an aunt who marched against the poll tax. My grandparents both had to pay poll taxes,” said Marcia Price, a Democratic state delegate who sponsored the legislation. “Just knowing that they lived under a system that was unfair and unequal, I learned very early that it was wrong, and that it needs to be changed.” .Virginia’s expansion of voting protections comes at a moment when the state has ushered through  .. Since the 2019 election, when  . to give the party full control of state government for the first time since 1993, Virginia has  .;  .; introduced an  .; raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour; and allowed local governments to remove  ., which was once home to the capital of the Confederacy. .Republicans’ longtime grip on Virginia politics reached even the state’s most liberal corners. In Arlington, a Democratic stronghold across the Potomac River from Washington, a main highway stretching south from the nation’s capital was named for the Confederacy’s president, Jefferson Davis, for nearly a century until 2019. Under pressure from Mr. Northam,  .. .The state’s voting rights act is being signed into law by a governor whose career was  . in 2019. Since then, Mr. Northam has been at the forefront of a host of the state’s racial justice initiatives and  .. He said on Wednesday that the Virginia law should become a model for the nation. .“At a time when voting rights are under attack across our country, Virginia is expanding access to the ballot box, not restricting it,” Mr. Northam said. “Our Commonwealth is creating a model for how states can provide comprehensive voter protections that strengthen democracy and the integrity of our elections.” .Virginia’s turn away from its longtime restrictions on voting rights began in 2016, when Gov. Terry McAuliffe  . in the state over the objections of the Republican-led General Assembly and the state’s Supreme Court. After the court ruled that Mr. McAuliffe did not have the authority to restore felon voting rights en masse, but  ., he sent 206,000 individual voting rights restoration letters to felons, who were sent envelopes with a Virginia voter application form and a self-addressed stamped envelope. .“To me it was a moral, civil rights issue and this was a racist Jim Crow law that needed to be eliminated,” Mr. McAuliffe said on Wednesday. .Once Democrats took full control of state government last year, one of the first bills they passed created one of the longest early-voting periods in the country — a 45-day window for no-excuse absentee voting, in which people can vote remotely without having to provide a rationale.  . in the 2020 election, nearly five times as many as did so in 2016. .“This is what my ancestors fought hard for,” said Charniele Herring, the author of the early voting bill, who last year became the first Black majority leader in the Virginia House of Delegates. “My parents had to have that struggle in the ’60s, and this is the time to stop that struggle and to protect everybody’s right to vote, no matter their political affiliation.” .Republican state legislators all opposed the Virginia Voting Rights Act, arguing that it would inundate local election administrators with lawsuits and complicate routine changes to voting. Glenn Davis,  . who is running for lieutenant governor, said it was “simple human nature” that Democrats’ efforts to make voting easier, like eliminating Virginia’s photo identification requirement, would result in more fraud. .“When they said African-Americans are less likely to have IDs and be able to go to the D.M.V. to get an ID, to me that sounds offensive,” said Mr. Davis, who is white. “No one has ever come to me that was not a politician and said, ‘Glenn, I find it more difficult to get an ID.’” .The local preclearance requirement that Mr. Northam approved on Wednesday was sponsored by two Black women, State Senator Jennifer McClellan and Ms. Price. Both said they had drawn inspiration from their family history of experiencing voter suppression in Virginia. .“I had a great-grandfather in 1901 who had to take a literacy test and find three white people to vouch for him to be able to register,” said Ms. McClellan, a Democrat who is running for governor this year,  .. “In January, I found a copy of my dad’s receipt for the poll tax he had to pay.” .Ms. Price said the idea to recreate the preclearance statute at the state level was first discussed in 2017 by a group of Democratic legislators, all women of color. But even though Virginia was trending blue, the General Assembly was still controlled by Republicans, in part because of gerrymandered legislative district lines. Those districts were  ., paving the way for a Democratic majority in both legislative chambers. .While the central provision in the bill is intended to be protective, rather than to create new, expansive policies, Ms. Price and Ms. McClellan pointed to several recent episodes that the bill would have helped prevent. In September 2020, with little public announcement, the Richmond registrar’s office moved from City Hall to a location that wasn’t as accessible by bus, causing confusion during early voting. The year before, the Virginia Beach City Council moved an early voting location to a building that was at least a mile away from the nearest bus stop. .Ms. Price said that instances of voter suppression in November, and  . being produced by Republican-controlled statehouses across the country, added increased urgency to their effort .“Yes, it was reactive to Virginia’s history, but it was also proactive because of what we were seeing in other states,” Ms. Price said. “And we knew that we were not immune to it.” .In approving the bill, Mr. Northam added a few technical changes, so it will go back to the legislature later this month for final passage to become law. .While other states have created their own voting rights laws, Virginia’s stood out for specifically recreating some of the original federal protections. .“It’s building on what states like California and Illinois to a certain extent have done, but we really saw an opportunity to model what a full voting rights act can do,” said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, a co-director of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. .The bill creates a provision that closely mirrors Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows affected groups and voters to challenge changes to balloting in court if they will negatively affect minority communities or lead to voter suppression. .Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act is currently being challenged at the Supreme Court,  .. .Other provisions in the bill help expand access to voting in Virginia by requiring local election officials to provide voting materials in languages other than English if they meet certain thresholds; strengthening protections against discriminatory redistricting plans; and creating a Voter Education and Outreach Fund where all penalties stemming from voting lawsuits would be directed toward educating voters on their rights. .Yet while establishing the Virginia Voting Rights Act represents both a symbolic and landmark protection of voting rights, the state still has old laws on the books that voting rights groups say act as barriers to the ballot box. The Virginia Constitution still bars convicted felons from regaining their voting rights, though they can seek to have their rights restored through permission by the governor, as Mr. McAuliffe did in 2016. .“There are a lot of remnants from Jim Crow that still exist in Virginia,” said Tram Nguyen, a co-executive director at New Virginia Majority, a progressive group, who also worked on the bill. “Passing the Voting Rights Act of Virginia — being the first state in the South, the first state that was covered under Section 5 of preclearance to do it — signals to the country that here’s a state that has this dark history. And we are trying to get beyond that.” .Reid J.

50,The Title Race Is Over. The Fight for the Top Four Starts Now.,"Here, then, is the home straight of the Premier League season, the final quarter of a campaign that was heralded as the most chaotic, and least predictable, of them all. .At times, throughout autumn and into winter, the combination of empty stadiums, a packed schedule and a frantic pace seemed destined to usurp the established order. Contenders seemed to rise and fall every week. Earnest conversations were held about whether Aston Villa  . or if Arsenal was  .. .It did not, it turns out, quite come to pass. It soon became clear that Manchester City — the team with the best and biggest squad, the side with the brightest coach — would be champion while spring was still fresh in the air. Pep Guardiola’s team sits 14 points clear of Manchester United, its fingers already brushing a third crown in four years. .Relegation, too, is largely settled. Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion will be playing in the Championship next season; all that remains to be decided is whether Fulham can muster enough momentum to condemn Newcastle, drifting and directionless, to a place alongside them. .In that relative certainty, the Premier League is something of an outlier across Europe’s major leagues. Elsewhere, the curious circumstances of the pandemic season do seem to have had an effect. In Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid are slowly reeling in a stuttering Atlético Madrid. In Italy, Inter Milan has six points on its city rival, A.C. Milan, and 10 on Juventus and Atalanta. But with at least one fairly spectacular choke in fans’ relatively recent memory, that is not yet a gap broad enough to permit any comfort. .In Germany, the title race may effectively be decided this weekend, when Bayern Munich travels to RB Leipzig on Saturday knowing that victory will all but see off its last remaining challenger. A couple hours earlier, the top two teams in France will meet, though neither Lille nor Paris St.-Germain is in a position to deliver a decisive blow. Lyon and a resurgent Monaco are within touching distance of both, four teams separated by four points. .In the absence of questions at the top and bottom of the table, the Premier League has concentrated all of its drama, jeopardy and intrigue into the jostling for position immediately below Manchester City. There are three more spots available in the Champions League for next season and seven teams with a realistic shot at one of them. .Some are fallen giants, teams desperate to salvage something from a bitterly disappointing season. Others are surprise packages, those teams that have best adapted to the strangeness of this season. It is at this point that the consequences of all the chaos and unpredictability of the last seven months are made flesh, and it is a race that is all but impossible to sort — at least not yet. “It will go until the last day,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Everton manager, said last month. The challenge, he said, is to make sure you are still in contention by then. .A glance at  . would indicate that two of the seven Champions League contenders — Manchester United and Leicester City — have a considerable advantage. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United has an eight-point lead on West Ham, currently the first team outside the places in fifth. Brendan Rodgers’s Leicester side has a seven-point cushion. .But in Leicester’s case, certainly, that head start could yet be canceled out by the fact that its remaining schedule is considerably steeper than some of its rivals’. Leicester faces Manchester City this weekend before traveling to West Ham. Three of its final four games are against direct rivals for a spot in the top four: trips to Manchester United and Chelsea, and a home game against Tottenham. Rodgers’s team surrendered a place in the top four on the final day last season; this year’s calendar brings with it the ghost of past regrets. .No other team has quite such an arduous finish to the campaign, though Chelsea is close. The extent of Thomas Tuchel’s impact at Stamford Bridge will be gauged by visits to West Ham and Manchester City, and looming home games against Arsenal and Leicester. .If the calendar is kindest to anyone, it is Liverpool, marooned in seventh after a dismal run since late December. That may prove scant solace for a team that has spent the last three months losing at home to Fulham, Brighton and Burnley, but it at least gives Jürgen Klopp’s side a slim chance of returning to Europe. .If anything has marked this season, it is the capriciousness of crisis. It is barely two weeks since José Mourinho  . his Tottenham players of being unable to display “the basics of football and the basics of life” during a humiliation at the hands of Dinamo Zagreb in the Europa League. Now he may wonder if being out of that competition is not such a bad thing. .Nine league games remain of Spurs’ season, and Mourinho must also make room for the Carabao Cup final on April 24. But, that aside, he has a clear run. So, too, do West Ham and Everton. Leicester has one extra game than its rivals — an F.A. Cup semifinal — but the rest have more demanding commitments to juggle. .Chelsea, for one, is still fighting on three fronts: An F.A. Cup semifinal against Manchester City beckons, as well as a two-legged Champions League quarterfinal with F.C. Porto. Should Chelsea reach the final of both competitions, it would have to play almost twice as many games as some of its rivals. .Liverpool has a Champions League quarterfinal, too — a more arduous pairing, against Real Madrid — and Manchester United will be expected to reach the final of the Europa League, adding another five games to its schedule. At the end of a season that has been particularly demanding, the strain of any added workload to tired legs may prove crucial. .That injury has proved a defining factor in the outcome of this Premier League season is neither surprising nor particularly debatable. The root of Liverpool’s collapse lies in its loss of its central defense; Leicester’s form stuttered with the absence, at various times, of Jamie Vardy, James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, among others; Everton’s results dipped when James Rodríguez was missing. .It would be reasonable, then, to assume that the next two months will be decided by  ., particularly to their key players. Liverpool, of course, is still missing Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip. Tottenham is without Son Heung-min. Leicester is without Barnes, Maddison and James Justin, while Manchester United is sweating on Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial. .Injuries can, of course, be sheer misfortune — a bad tackle, a mistimed movement — but they can also be cumulative, the effect of a player pushed too far into what Arsène Wenger used to call the “ ..” But that is not the only consequence of fatigue. Even if injury is avoided, performance can dip. .It is this, more than anything, that should give Solskjaer and Manchester United pause. United’s captain, Harry Maguire, has played 3,946 minutes this season, an order of magnitude greater than every other outfield player in England. He has played the equivalent of five full games more this season than his nearest rival, Leicester’s Youri Tielemans. .But Maguire is not alone. United has seven players who have played more than 2,700 minutes this season. Leicester and Everton have only one, Chelsea two, and Spurs and West Ham three. Even Liverpool, its options reduced because of all those injuries, has only five. If fatigue does prove to be a factor, the core of United’s side is more likely to be afflicted in the final stretch than anyone else. .To some extent, of course, that is offset by its resources: Solskjaer has options should any of his key players be sidelined or suffer an alarming drop in form. Having to play Donny van de Beek because Bruno Fernandes needs a rest should be no great sacrifice. .Indeed, that may well be the formula, more than any other, that comes to define the next two months, that serves to find the signal in the noise of this season. More than in any other season, the final prize on offer in the Premier League will go to the teams that can best minimize the effects of fatigue, thanks to a reduced workload or by possessing the strength in depth to ride it out. In all the chaos, in the end, there will be some sort of order.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/soccer/premier-league-champions-league-places.html

52,"A Virus Races Through the Horse World. No, Not That Virus.","Shortly after arriving from abroad last month, Dr. Kent Allen’s new patient spiked a low fever. The doctor inserted a sterile swab into his patient’s nostril, a P.C.R. test to determine if this was yet another case of a potentially deadly virus sweeping the globe. .Then the patient went back to eating his hay. .The gray Irish Sport Horse, named McCoy, tested negative for an illness currently devastating European equestrian sports. An outbreak of a neurological form of the common equine herpes virus has killed nearly 20 horses and sickened over 100 more. It has forced the shutdown of competitions across 10 European countries. .With eerie echoes of the human coronavirus and the current pandemic, the virulent equine virus, which can kill a horse in less than 24 hours, has raced through the sport horse industry at a time when experts say it can least afford it: The shutdowns to stop the spread of the virus, known as E.H.V., come after nearly a year of shutdowns in the face of Covid-19. The coronavirus closed barns and canceled international championships, including last year’s World Cup Finals for dressage and show jumping, an important Olympic proving ground. .The event was to take place this week in Gothenburg, Sweden. Instead, on March 12, it was canceled again. .“On the back of Covid, which is of course still having a devastating impact worldwide, this E.H.V.-1 outbreak has been particularly tough,” Dr. Goran Akerstrom, the veterinary director of the Fédération Equestre Internationale, or F.E.I., the international governing body of equestrian sports, said in an email. “Particularly for those that have lost horses.” .He added, “To lose the F.E.I. World Cup Finals two years in a row — and to two different viruses — has been incredibly hard.” .The outbreak began at an international competition in Valencia, Spain, in late February, killing several top German show horses on the grounds. Organizers locked down some of the 752 animals in attendance, but some riders had left with their animals for their home countries — unwittingly taking the virus with them. The virus has since been identified in 10 nations — Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Slovakia and Qatar — possibly linked to the Valencia event. The United States has been spared, so far. .“I still can’t believe that we had no opportunity to help you,” Tim-Uwe Hoffmann, a German rider, wrote on Instagram in tribute to his mare, Casta Lee FRH, who died after testing positive at the Valencia show. .The F.E.I. has ordered international competitions on mainland Europe shut until at least mid-April. Nearly 4,000 horses who were in contact with potentially contagious animals after the show in Valencia have been ordered isolated for 21 days by the federation, which is conducting a sweeping test-and-trace initiative across European farms. After the isolation ends, they must return a negative P.C.R. test to return to competition. .“It was basically a textbook superspreader event,” Dr. Allen, McCoy’s owner, said of the Valencia competition. Dr. Allen is a veterinarian based in Middleburg, Va., who also serves as the F.E.I.’s head veterinarian for the United States. .The equine herpes virus is not a new enemy; it is endemic in the horse population and typically manifests as a runny nose and fever. But the version that has raced through barns after the Spain outbreak is far more deadly. It invades the central nervous system and causes myeloencephalopathy, or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The death itself, veterinarians say, is swift but brutal. .Biosecurity can be difficult: Shed virus can be spread by touch, on clothing and down a barn aisle by a snorting horse. While horses are routinely vaccinated for herpes, which affords some protection, the vaccine does not necessarily stop them from shedding virus. The virus can incubate in an animal for nearly a month, causing no signs of distress. Sick horses can test negative; asymptomatic horses can spread the disease. .For years, competition organizers and riders have largely paid lip service to biosecurity measures like sanitizing shared areas and keeping foreign animals apart, according to veterinarians and show staff. Pathogens are spread readily in a sporting environment where horses routinely swap stalls when stabled at competitions, nibble the same grass and touch noses beside the arena. .“You’d talk biosecurity measures, and their eyes would glaze over,” Dr. Allen said. “It’s: ‘You send us that protocol, and we’ll shove it in the deepest depths of our filing cabinet.’” .But the trauma that humans have experienced for the past year may be their horses’ best defense: After over a year of social distancing, vigorous hand washing and masking, industry leaders say, the equine world is stepping up to stem the spread in a way that it did not in past outbreaks, such as one in Ogden, Utah, in 2011, which reached at least a half-dozen states before it was quelled .“In today’s climate with the Covid-19 pandemic, people are very aware of the need to practice biosecurity measures for themselves and were primed to take additional steps to keep their horses safe when protocols were recommended,” Dr. Stephen Schumacher, the chief administrator of U.S. Equestrian’s equine drugs and medications program, said in an emailed statement. .Those steps stateside have so far appeared to ward off an American outbreak. But the specter of the disease, which gets little reaction most years when it crops up, has set the American industry on edge. .In early March, at a competition at the World Equestrian Center in Ocala, Fla., news of a virus case in a horse that had competed at the facility sent frissons of anxiety through competitors, hundreds of whom had flocked to the show grounds, which opened this season for the first time. .Though there was no outbreak on the grounds, entries plummeted to 500, from over 2,000, shortly after the show alerted competitors about the ill animal, as riders packed up their horses and left, according to Dr. Larry Wexler, the competition’s official veterinarian. The entries have since rebounded. Through a publicist, an owner of the center, Roby Roberts, declined to comment. .This month, a quarter horse, a warmblood and an Arabian from separate stables in California tested positive for the neurological form of the virus, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center, exposing dozens of their stablemates. Cases have cropped up in places like Kentucky and New York, according to the center, as well as in Canada, where a larger outbreak forced several barns to quarantine in February. .It is unclear if the smattering of American cases is linked to the European illness, or merely incidences of the virus that routinely occur. In Europe, F.E.I. officials are optimistic that the worst has passed, but emphasize that there are still reasons for caution. .So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not suspended the importation of horses from affected countries. Smaller nations like Jamaica, where an outbreak might overwhelm the limited horse population, banned imports in an attempt to keep the virus from its shores, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries’ veterinary services division. .So when McCoy, the gray Irish sport horse gelding, which Dr. Allen imported for his wife, Dr. Rae Stone, spiked a fever shortly after arriving on American soil last month, Dr. Allen whipped out a nasal swab. .“It was no big deal,” Dr. Allen said after the P.C.R. test came back negative for the herpes virus. Still, he said, he had to wonder: “When that is going on the European continent, and you’re importing horses over here, are you importing problems?”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/olympics/equestrian-horse-virus-deaths.html
53,Want to Go to Europe This Summer? Here Are Your Options,"With the number of people in the United States vaccinated against the coronavirus climbing, Americans are starting to explore their prospects for international travel this summer, a season when Europe is traditionally a big draw. .Most of Europe has been off-limits to most U.S. citizens for over a year, and the continent is currently grappling with a third wave of coronavirus infections and a surge in new, more contagious variants, making it unclear when its borders will reopen. But some European countries have started to welcome  ., including American tourists, and others are making preparations to ease restrictions in time for the summer season. .Vaccine and health certificates that would help speed travel are under development, which could make it easier for tourism to restart. The 27 member countries of the European Union have endorsed the idea of a vaccine certificate. While individual European countries will still set their own rules, the initiative is expected to establish a coordinated approach across the continent. .“Finally, we have a tangible solution to coordinating and harmonizing travel measures,” said Eduardo Santander, chief executive of the  . an association of national tourism organizations based in Brussels. “I think other countries like the U.S. will also come up with their own technological solutions that will be compatible and after a period of trials this summer, a global standard will be established.” .In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still recommending against travel — even for those vaccinated — citing the risks of catching and spreading the virus while away from home. And ultimately, the course of the virus will determine what travel looks like across the world. But here’s what we know about how European countries are preparing to restart tourism. .Last summer, when the United States reported more coronavirus infections and deaths than any other country, Americans were barred from entering the European bloc for vacation. .There have been a few exceptions: Turkey has been letting U.S. citizens enter if they produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 PCR test before departure, as has Croatia, and several countries that are not members of the European Union,  .As the number of cases has risen in Europe, and vaccination has been sluggish, several European Union countries have gone back into lockdown. France, Belgium and Portugal have reintroduced stringent measures that restrict nonessential travel, even from within the bloc and within what is known as the Schengen Zone, which includes nonmember countries that allow free movement across their borders. .“Right now, in some European countries, it might feel like you are in the middle of a storm, which is how we felt in the U.K a couple of months ago,” said Gloria Guevara Manzo, chief executive and president of the  ., a forum that works with governments to raise awareness about the travel industry. .“But I think once we accelerate the vaccination rollout while applying strong safety protocols and testing, then by the summer we will be in a situation where European countries will be able to open up around the same time,” she added. .But that’s likely to be for travel within Europe, rather than between Europe and the United States. .“The current focus is on opening up internal markets within the E.U and U.K. and then depending on reciprocity agreements, more third countries will be included,” said Eric Dresin, Secretary General of the  .. “But right now, we are not talking about Americans visiting Europe.” .American travelers do have some options, though: Having brought the virus under control, Iceland is allowing all vaccinated travelers — including those from the United States — to enter without being subject to Covid-19 testing or quarantine measures. .Greece, one of the most popular European summer destinations for Americans, announced this month that it would reopen for all tourists in mid-May, as long as they show proof of vaccination, antibodies or a negative Covid-19 test result before traveling. All visitors will be subject to random testing upon arrival. .Turkey said it would not require international travelers to be vaccinated this summer and will re-evaluate testing policies after April 15. .Other European countries like Slovenia and Estonia are letting in vaccinated tourists, but not those from the United States. .Spain, which relies heavily on tourism for its economy, said it would reopen to international visitors in the spring, once between 30 and 40 percent of its adult population is vaccinated. Portugal is also hoping to reopen its borders by May, but it is not yet clear whether Americans will be allowed in. .Americans were never barred from entering the United Kingdom, which left the European Union last year, during the pandemic and can visit today, but face strict testing and quarantine requirements. In England, where a 10-day quarantine is required, the time can be reduced if a person presents a negative Covid-19 PCR test on day five. .Violations can result in penalties of up to $13,860 and 10 years in prison. .Most of Britain is under strict lockdown and while a stay-at-home-order is to be lifted on March 29, most shops, restaurants and pubs will stay closed until at least mid-April. Scotland has started to ease restrictions and will continue to do so in phases. .Domestic tourism and indoor dining is not expected to resume until May 17 at the earliest. In anticipation of restrictions being lifted,  . “staycation sailings” around the British Isles starting in June. .Many Britons traveled last summer when the virus seemed to have ebbed, and a recent study found that they brought a significant number of infections back into the United Kingdom. A ban on British travel abroad for leisure was enacted on Jan. 4 and was expected to expire in May, but the government introduced legislation this week that lays down the legal framework to extend the restrictions until the end of June. .It is not clear when exactly the United Kingdom will lift its quarantine requirements for more tourism, but  . forecasts a slow recovery that will start toward late summer. .Earlier this month, the  . proposed a digital travel certificate that would prove that a person has been vaccinated, received a negative Covid-19 test result or recovered after contracting the virus. .To travel to the European Union, you will have to tick one of the three boxes. .The document, known as a Digital Green Certificate, would allow European Union residents and their family members to travel freely within the bloc’s member states. The commission is also working to coordinate with the World Health Organization to make sure that the certificates are compatible with systems in countries outside Europe. .The documents would be free and available in digital or paper format and if approved by the European Parliament, the bloc plans to roll them out within three months. .Non-European Union nationals will be able to request a Digital Green Certificate from the member country they plan to visit. The rules for proof of vaccinations will be the same as for European Union nationals: Vaccines that the bloc has authorized will be accepted and individual member states will be able to decide whether to accept others. .“The Digital Green Certificate will not be a precondition to free movement, and it will not discriminate in any way,” said Didier Reynders, the bloc’s top official for justice. “A common E.U.-approach will not only help us to gradually restore free movement within the E.U. and avoid fragmentation. It is also a chance to influence global standards and lead by example based on our European values like data protection.” .Currently, all airline passengers age 2 and older traveling to the United States must provide a negative Covid-19 viral test (NAAT or antigen test) taken within three calendar days of travel.  ., so travelers should check what their state requires before booking a vacation abroad. .Each country sets its own rules, but most safety protocols are unlikely to change this summer, even for those who have been vaccinated. .Visitors will be expected to wear masks and keep a safe distance in public spaces. Hotels, restaurants and event spaces will have enhanced cleaning protocols in place, and some may impose capacity restrictions. .“I think it’s very important that governments strike a balance of easing restrictions this summer, while maintaining safety protocols to control the disease,” Mr. Santander of the European Travel Commission said. “We really don’t want to find ourselves in a situation in 2022 where we have to close borders again and go into lockdown for another year.”",Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/travel/europe-travel-covid-vaccine.html
54,"The Yankees Start 2021 With Some Enthusiasm, and a Loss","Twenty minutes before Gerrit Cole threw the first pitch of the 2021 Major League Baseball season on Thursday, his teammate, D.J. LeMahieu, emerged from the Yankees’ dugout and jogged to the outfield to stretch. He was met with something absent from Yankee Stadium since October 2019: applause and cheers from fans. .For the first time in what has felt like forever for many, baseball was back in New York in a fashion that resembled normality. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Yankees performed for a television-only audience last year. Now in what is hoped to be the downslope of the pandemic, Yankees fans were allowed to return to see their World Series hopeful team in person. .In front of a crowd of 10,850 fans, the Yankees fell to the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-2, in 10 innings. Nick Nelson, the Yankees relief pitcher, surrendered the go-ahead run on a double to Randal Grichuk. But there is less reason for Yankees fans to worry about any individual loss this season: M.L.B. teams are scheduled to play their traditional 162-game regular season unlike the pandemic-shortened, 60-game season last year. .“It wasn’t the result we wanted, but having that buzz, having that energy back in the stadium was something special that we all enjoyed,” Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said. “I was talking with the guys and a couple umpires. Everybody missed it.” .While the Blue Jays are expected to present a formidable challenge this season, the Yankees are widely considered the best team in the American League East and one of the favorites to win the World Series. Armed with one of the most powerful lineups in baseball and a deeper starting rotation than before, the Yankees hope to end a championship drought that enters its 12th season despite their prodigious talent and spending. .“The expectations with the Yankees never really change every year,” said Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, the only player from the 2009 World Series-winning team on the current roster. “We’ve got our eyes set on the ultimate prize and obviously it’s been way too long since we’ve been back to the World Series.” .With a similar cast of characters to this year’s team, the Yankees struggled with injuries and inconsistency last season. They went 33-27 and failed to repeat as American League East champions, finishing second to the Tampa Bay Rays. Their season ended in familiar fashion, with a loss to the Rays in second round of the playoffs. After each early postseason exit, Judge has called the year a failure, a shortcoming he has said he thinks about every day. .This season and next are critical for the current group of Yankees. Several key players — Judge, catcher Gary Sanchez, pitcher Aroldis Chapman and others — are eligible for free agency after the 2022 season. .“A lot of our outstanding core players are really smack dab in the middle of the prime of their careers so we understand the urgency, the importance of playing well, and that all feeds into the hunger that exists with this team,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said recently. “They’ve tasted a lot of success but have also come up short a lot.” .To get over the hump and improve their roster, the Yankees’ most significant additions over the winter were adding high-risk, high-reward starting pitchers Corey Kluber and Jameson Taillon, who combined to throw one inning last season because of injuries. .Still, the Yankees’ pitching staff has fewer holes than the Blue Jays’ on paper. But on Thursday, the Yankees’ lineup couldn’t solve a Blue Jays bullpen that was without closer Kirby Yates, who will miss the entire season because of elbow surgery. .Hoping to bounce back from an awful 2020 season, Sanchez smashed his first career opening-day home run, a two-run blast off Blue Jays starter Hyun-jin Ryu that gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the second inning. But Cole, with his family from California in the stands, coughed up a game-tying home run to Teoscar Hernandez in the sixth on a hanging slider over the heart of the plate. .“I just want that slider back,” Cole said. .The Yankees’ lineup threatened throughout the game but couldn’t capitalize. In the 10th inning, the Blue Jays broke through. To cut down on the length of games during the pandemic, M.L.B. and the players’ union implemented rules in which extra innings begin with a runner on second base. On the second pitch he saw, Grichuk doubled home Jonathan Davis, while the Yankees struck out three times to end the game. .Despite the loss, Cole said he was happy this season began on time and with fans in the stands. Earlier in the week, Cole said playing with artificial crowd noise and fan-less stadiums last year was surreal. .“It was something that you didn’t really realize would have as much of an impact as it did,” he said. “We’re more grateful to be able to share this experience with the fans going forward. It’s something that I’ll always remember. And every time I see a fan or sign an autograph for a kid, I’ll remember that at one point this was taken away from us.” .Fans, though, were perhaps too eager to see Judge again. After he caught a ball at the wall in foul territory to end the top of the ninth inning, a fan tried to reach into Judge’s glove. .“It’s their first time back at a stadium in a long time,” Judge said. “I’ll give them that one.” .Others were simply happy to back in familiar surroundings. In Section 224, Michael Mayer, a North Jersey native wearing a Derek Jeter jersey, sat with his girlfriend, Lia Bella. Since he was a child, Mayer came to opening day every year with his father. But last year was the first season opener he said he hadn’t attended since 1985. .So when  . that the Yankees could host fans at a limited capacity to start the season, Mayer, 40, and Bella, 35, vowed to be in the stands. During Thursday’s game, Mayer smiled as he held a sign that Bella made. It read: “Just happy to be here.”",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/baseball/yankees-blue-jays-opening-day.html

56,FIFA Has a Plan for Africa. But Who Does It Serve?," Something strange has happened, Tariq. A few weeks ago, someone drew my attention to a  . from Barbara Gonzalez, the chief executive at Simba, one of the biggest clubs in Tanzania, that seemed to reveal a plan that would change the face of African soccer: a pan-continental super league. .But that’s not the strange part. The strange part is that it turns out it’s the brainchild of Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president. As a general rule, making sure you’re on the opposite side of any argument from Infantino is a solid strategy. But in this case my instinct is to say that, at least as an idea, this kind of makes sense. .Please explain to me why I am wrong, so that the world can be restored to its axis. . As with everything when it comes to FIFA — and typically FIFA under Gianni Infantino — the devil is in the detail. Or, in this case, the lack of detail. .Infantino first announced his big idea for Africa  ., but it had been dormant until this random tweet (more on that in a minute). But when Infantino first went public, people inside FIFA say there was no business plan: just Gianni firing from the hip, claiming it could generate $200 million in revenue. That’s a big number as far as African club football is concerned, but there is no evidence of where it came from. .It reminds me of the time Gianni walked into a FIFA Council meeting and told the board to sign a document that would allow him to sell the Club World Cup to private investors (who turned out to be SoftBank). The members, led by European officials, wanted details. An internal audit found the event was worth considerably less than Gianni had suggested. .Now, back to the tweet: It turns out FIFA officials were surprised, too. Barbara González walked up to Gianni at the Confederation of African Football Congress and asked to have her photo taken with him. Five minutes later, she sent out the tweet. Now I’m not saying a league in Africa is a bad idea, but surely there must be a robust plan before such a major project is undertaken? . If nothing else, you have to admire the chutzpah of that, not least because Infantino strikes me as  .the sort of person who would fall for the old “as you were saying” ruse. .There does, as you say, have to be a robust plan: economically, of course, but in a sporting sense, too. The basic idea strikes me as sound. Certainly south of the Sahara, African club soccer struggles horribly for investment. That means that the vast majority of nations that produce a constant stream of players for European clubs rarely see any of that talent on show in domestic leagues. That, in turn, hardly entices fans to go and watch games live. And that completes a neat but vicious circle, because it means that, yes, clubs struggle horribly for investment. .A Super League would address some of those issues. A better television deal, if nothing else, would enable clubs to invest in infrastructure. That might help nurture young talent and keep it for a little longer. It doesn’t seem impossible to me that a Pan-African league might be able to rival one of the talent-generating leagues in Europe — the Netherlands or Portugal, say — for quality in a relatively short space of time. .Of course, there is one thorny issue that I haven’t yet had the nerve to bring up. I reckon I could come up with a fairly cogent list of 20 or so African teams that would have a good case for inclusion, thanks to history or support or location. But I am guessing that Infantino and CAF, which is now run by a staunch ally of his, might have a different system in mind? . The little we know so far is that there is an expectation that participating teams would have to invest at least $20 million per season, for five seasons. For clubs in Africa, that is a significant outlay, and it suggests it would not be the most popular teams, so much as the ones that have the backing of wealthy benefactors. But again: Beyond the odd tweet and Gianni’s off-the-cuff remarks, we have nothing concrete. .There are other ways of trying to come up with likely participants. You could use the CAF club coefficient, which is essentially a points system for clubs in the region based on their historic success. But that would mean a league dominated by clubs from wealthier North African countries, with only a dozen or so of the continent’s 54 countries likely to be represented. . That lack of representation would, I think, ultimately be unavoidable. For a tournament like this to be valid, there are certain clubs that would have to be included. Al Ahly and Zamalek from Cairo, would be names one and two. Both Raja and Wydad from Casablanca, and Esperance and Étoile du Sahel, the twin totems of Tunisian soccer. .You would certainly need South Africa’s Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. And you could throw Mamelodi Sundowns in there, too: It is owned by Patrice Motsepe, Infantino’s ally and the new CAF president. Simba, of Tanzania, clearly expect to be involved. TP Mazembe, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, would have to be. .Beyond that, the continent’s powerhouse nations — Cameroon, Senegal, Algeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and, particularly, Nigeria — would command at least one place each. Suddenly, the whole thing looks pretty full, even before thinking about Angola, Sudan and Ethiopia. . If there was a method to wrap this league into the existing pyramid, there would probably be far more buy-in. The idea that teams from across the region would have — at least in theory — a shot at one day making it into the competition would make the proposition far more palatable to those, even among the larger clubs, who are not enthused about it. .Even then, there are the logistics of it: not only to create a level playing field, but a sensible calendar and schedule, given the enormous differences in weather and transport infrastructure across the region. Given the uncertainty and sense of unease among the African football community, there needs to be an urgent and transparent discussion about what this is, and what this is not. A series of clandestine meetings followed by a high-profile announcement that does not stand up to scrutiny is not enough. . There is, definitely, a back-of-a-cigarette-packet air to the idea. And worse still, it has the feel of something that is being imposed on Africa, rather than generated from within it. The problem of representation bears that out: this sort of thing is much easier to conceive if, deep down, you regard Africa as a single, homogeneous entity, grateful for your interest. .And that — given Infantino’s apparent passion for the idea — makes you wonder what the purpose of it all is. Has it been suggested in an attempt to make African domestic soccer stronger, a challenging but essentially admirable aim? Or is there something else at play here? . There’s a suspicion that Gianni’s motivations may be less to do with securing the future of African soccer and more his hopes of creating a club competition that can rival and, eventually, overtake the Champions League. For that to happen, the expanded Club World Cup needs teams from all over the world who can compete with the powerhouses of Europe. .In that light, Africa might just be the start, the canary in the coal mine. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but those involved should be clear about their intentions. And a defining project for the future of African soccer should be guided by those with skin in the game, no question, rather than a Swiss bureaucrat intent on a legacy project. . Ah, that’s a relief. I feel as though I am on much more solid ground now: the idea might have some merit, but the rationale behind it may not. That may not be good news for African soccer, which finds itself being used as a pawn in a broader power game, but it’s good news for my personal moral compass, because it means I don’t have to worry about being on the same side of an argument as Gianni Infantino. .There was, just as there was always going to be, one last hurdle to clear. Most European soccer executives were expecting a blueprint for a new vision of the Champions League to be approved — both by UEFA, the competition’s organizer, and the European Clubs Association, Andrea Agnelli’s bad-idea factory — and announced this week. .That had to be pushed back, though, when several of the continent’s major teams blew up the deal at the 11th hour: It turns out that actually they want to have final say on the competition’s commercial rights, too. Suddenly, it seems as if the new-look Champions League may end up being the lesser of two evils. .Quite how that revamped competition will work is laid out clearly and concisely — and, crucially, in the form of a graphic —  .. So clearly and concisely, in fact, that for the first time it is possible to say without fear of having missed something that this iteration of the Champions League will make the tournament immeasurably worse. .Not, though, for the reasons so often given. Yes, there will be more meetings between the game’s superpowers, and for lower stakes. Yes, the whole thing is bloated. Yes, it will starve domestic competitions of oxygen. And yes, it still might serve to entrench the financial inequality that is the real enemy of the game’s ongoing health. .But the main problem is much simpler: The redesign reduces the Champions League’s competitive integrity. It is, essentially, invalid to draw up a league table in which all of the teams play different opponents. It renders it meaningless. And it is quite likely that fans, who are not as stupid as they are taken to be, will notice. .A few days ago, as England threatened to run up the score in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino, the poacher-turned-pundit Gary Lineker suggested it was time to admit that these mismatches — which characterize a substantial amount of international soccer — were of benefit and interest to precisely nobody. .Instead, he said, perhaps it would be in everyone’s interests for some of Europe’s smaller nations to engage in a prequalifying tournament, playing one another for the right to face the continent’s elite, and England. The reaction — Do I really need to say this? You know what the reaction is, because it’s always the same reaction — was furious. .To Lineker’s critics, those who accused him of trying to ghettoize soccer’s underdogs, what followed was karmic retribution.  .. Spain needed a late goal  .. Latvia  .. And, best of all,  ., the country’s first loss in a World Cup qualifier for 20 years. .It goes without saying that all of these results were welcome, impressive, and hilarious. But it does not mean that the idea Lineker espoused — one that has been around for years — should be dismissed. .First of all: That is how qualifying works in Africa, Asia and North and Central America. It helps to thin the calendar a little, something that matters at a time when players are being run into the ground by all of the teams they represent. Second: The success of the Nations League has shown that games between smaller nations are more competitive, and therefore both more entertaining and more educational, than watching the same teams be steamrollered by the giants. .And third: At the same time as all those shocks were rumbling through Europe, England was scoring five against San Marino, the Czechs ran in six in Estonia, and both Belgium and Denmark scored eight, against Belarus and Moldova. Worse still, a team managed by Frank de Boer  .. Some of soccer’s lesser lights are competitive. Some are not. If only there was a way of selecting which teams fell into which categories. .We have been here before. On Thursday, it emerged that Mino Raiola and Alfie Haaland — respectively the agent and the father of Erling Haaland, the goal cyborg — were in Catalonia for a meeting with Joan Laporta,  .. The race for the hottest property in European soccer is, it seems, on. .It is a move straight from the playbook that eventually led the younger Haaland to Borussia Dortmund, his current home, about 15 months ago. Expect Raiola and Haaland’s father to turn up in relatively short order in Madrid, too. They will almost certainly stop off in London after that: Chelsea harbors hopes of signing the 20-year-old Haaland. They may need two days in Manchester; they would not want to rush United or City. .The fact that they are doing their due diligence on their client/son’s next home is, then, no surprise. More eye-catching is the fact that they feel Barcelona’s hopes of signing Haaland are valid, given that Dortmund has made it plain that it will not sell him for less than $150 million, and because Barcelona is, well, currently  .. .Laporta, clearly, feels he can make a deal work. Perhaps he can. Perhaps there is some way of shifting the money around enough for Barcelona to remain a viable candidate. The appeal is obvious: Signing Haaland would, almost at a stroke, turn Barcelona into major players again. But then so, too, is the problem: After all the club has been through, would it really be a good idea? .Aside from the virgin hope of opening day — and possibly the breathless frenzy of Christmas — this is the best part of the soccer season. The end of the March international break heralds not only the arrival of spring, but the start of European club soccer’s race to the summit. Over the next two months, closure will arrive. .Better yet, this time around, we hit the ground running. The top two in both France and Germany will meet on Saturday: first, Lille visits Paris St.-Germain, the two of them level on points, and only a nose ahead of Lyon and Monaco. (I’ll have a story on Lille posting in a few hours.) No sooner has that finished, though, than RB Leipzig hosts a Bayern Munich deprived of Robert Lewandowski, and knowing that a win would close the gap at the top of the Bundesliga to a single point. .In England, meanwhile, the ultimate prize is off the table: It is a matter of when, not if, Manchester City claims a third title in four years. But the battle to finish second, third and fourth — and therefore obtain a place in next season’s not-yet-ruined Champions League —  .. My money would be on Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester, in that order, but it’s so close that it wouldn’t be much of my money. .Only space for one, this week, from  .. “I’m trying to figure out how much disappointment is warranted right now as a supporter of the United States,” he wrote. “How do you rate the U.S.A. men’s team’s failed attempts to qualify for Tokyo? There’s a lot of talk about the Olympics as a training ground for the next generation, but when I look at the U.S. squad, the next generation is playing senior friendlies in Europe.” .This is only a personal perspective, Charles, and it is a distinctly European one: My view would, I think, be different if I was South American or African. But in the narrow context of soccer, I’m not convinced the Olympics matter particularly. .It is special for the players to win a gold medal, of course, particularly when it at least rivals the high-point of that country’s soccer achievements thus far (Nigeria in 1996, Cameroon in 2000, Mexico in 2012) or when it is Argentina (2004 and 2008), and the World Cup brings nothing but misery. .But in terms of being used a signpost for greater things to come? In men’s soccer, no, not really. Put it this way: I had to check who won the gold at Rio in 2016. Turns out it was Brazil! They must have enjoyed that. It probably didn’t make up for what happened in a different tournament on home soil  .. .Women’s soccer, of course, has historically placed much more importance on it — the cover of Abby Wambach’s autobiography describes her as a gold medalist, rather than a World Cup winner — but I wonder if that, too, will change with the increased focus on the Women’s World Cup.",Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/sports/soccer/fifa-gianni-infantino-africa.html
0,"Biden's $2T spending plan, billed as infrastructure bill, spends less than half on infrastructure"," $2 trillion   plan, which is being promoted largely as a bill to address  , directs well under half of its total money to things traditionally defined as infrastructure, according to a Fox News analysis.  The analysis, based on the 25-page summary of the president's proposal for the ""American Jobs Plan,"" indicates less than $750 billion of the spending fits even a broad definition of infrastructure.  The White House is casting a very wide net about what constitutes infrastructure — for example, the American Jobs Plan references ""care infrastructure"" when talking about $25 billion to upgrade child care facilities and a $400 billion expenditure on care for the elderly and disabled. That's quite different from repairing potholes and rebuilding bridges.  Senate Republicans, meanwhile, in emphasizing that Biden's plan largely does not address infrastructure, are often using a very restrictive definition of the word.  ""This plan is not about rebuilding America’s backbone. Less than 6% of this massive proposal goes to roads and bridges,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""It would spend more money just on electric cars than on America’s roads, bridges, ports, airports, and waterways combined."" Indeed, the White House summary of the American Jobs Plan says it will spend ""$115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair"" out of more than $2 trillion in the plan. That is slightly under 6%.  But what counts and does not count as infrastructure can be tricky to define, according to Cato Institute Director of Tax Policy Studies Chris Edwards.  ""The first thing to know is there is no hard definition of infrastructure. Economists have no hard definition of infrastructure,"" Edwards said in an interview with Fox News.  Fox News' analysis of the Biden plan, as outlined in its 25-page fact sheet, broadly counted investments going toward physical repair or building of facilities and systems used by the general public that help the economy. This includes, for example, replacing lead pipes, expanding broadband access and modernizing public schools, in addition to money going to things traditionally associated with the word infrastructure like roads, bridges and ports.  Other items that counted to reach a total of just under $750 billion included $50 billion to preserve infrastructure resilience, $80 billion for Amtrak and $20 billion for road safety. Elements of the Biden plan Fox News excluded from this analysis included $174 billion being spent on electric vehicles; $400 billion on home-based care for the elderly and disabled; $25 billion on child care facilities; and $50 billion on ""research infrastructure"" at the National Science Foundation. Fox News also excluded $213 billion in Biden's plan that's directed at home sustainability and public housing; at least $35 billion aimed at R&D related to climate change; $50 billion to create a new office at the Department of Commerce to ""dedicated to monitoring domestic industrial capacity and funding investments to support production of critical goods;"" $30 billion to prepare for future pandemics; $45 billion for the federal government to buy clean energy goods; $14 billion ""to bring together industry, academia, and government to advance technologies and capabilities critical to future competitiveness;"" and several other provisions.  One part of Biden's plan that does not cost any money is the PRO Act, which would essentially override right-to-work laws in states across the country, allowing unions to extract dues from workers who do not want to be members.  Biden's American Jobs Plan, at this point, is simply a 25-page document of suggestions. Legislators have not even begun drafting it. That means dollar totals and specific allocations could change.  But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a comment Wednesday himself noted that the Biden plan includes much more than infrastructure.  ""Addressing infrastructure, climate and environmental justice together, and creating millions of good paying jobs, is just the right combination to meet head on the challenges that America now faces,"" Schumer said. ""This will not only make clean energy and clean transportation affordable, it will create millions of new jobs with good wages, which always occurs when we invest in infrastructure and manufacturing as we will be doing here."" Cato's Edwards, meanwhile, says his biggest gripe with the Biden plan is that the money being spent, no matter how it is defined, is largely going into the pockets of big corporations. ""It's hugely ironic because the leading Democrats have bashed corporate welfare and corporate subsidies for years, and they always claim that Republicans do corporate subsidies,"" Edwards told Fox News. ""But in fact, Biden would subsidize corporations hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars with this plan.""  ""Manufacturing, $300 billion. Electric vehicles, $170 billion. Broadband, $100 billion. Electric power grid, $100 billion. This is completely unneeded and it's also very dangerous because we don't want the federal government manipulating what broadband companies do, what electric power companies do,"" Edwards said.  He added: ""One of the interesting political things in coming weeks and months will be will the Democrat left, like Sanders and Warren, kind of come to the realization that, 'Hey, this is massive corporate subsidies here, which we're supposed to be against.'"" Edwards also said that the corporate tax hikes used to fuel the $2 trillion-plus spending plan would be counterproductive to its goals, hurting the massive private companies like ""AT&T and Verizon and other companies that do broadband and invest-- you know infrastructure investment."" ""Biden would be taking with one hand in taxes what he's giving on the other end, subsidies, which makes no sense,"" Edwards said.  Biden and the White House, of course, would dispute Edwards' points.  ""It's time to build our economy from the bottom-up and the middle-out, not the top-down,"" Biden said in remarks unveiling the plan in Pittsburgh Wednesday. ""And this time when we rebuild the middle class, we're going to bring everybody along regardless of your background, your color, your religion, where everybody gets to come along.""  ""The American jobs plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads and Main Streets that are difficult, difficult shape right now,"" Biden added. ""It will fix the nation's 10 most economically significant bridges in America that require replacement."" ""Altogether, along with the American Rescue Plan, the proposal I put forward will create millions of jobs, estimated by some Wall Street outfits there will be 18 million jobs over four years, good-paying jobs,"" Biden also said in Pittsburgh. ""It also works to level the playing field to empower workers and ensure that the new jobs are good jobs, that you can raise a family on, and ensure a free and fair choice to organize and bargain collectively."" The White House and press secretary Jen Psaki have indicated that they are open to negotiating with Republicans over Biden's spending plan. But it remains unclear how much Democrats would actually be willing to compromise on in order to secure Republican votes. ""I'm not going to give you red lines from here,"" Psaki told reporters on Thursday.  If Republicans and Democrats cannot come to the kind of agreement that can get the support of 10 Republicans and reach the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate, Democrats will likely be forced to move the package ahead via budget reconciliation. That process allows them to circumvent the filibuster and therefore avoid negotiating with Republicans,  ""I support improving America’s aging roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure. And we can do so in a bipartisan way,"" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. But, he said, Biden's plan includes ""these broad policy priorities that are a far cry away from what we’ve ever defined as infrastructure."" Psaki on Thursday, meanwhile, said she believes there is a lot to agree on in the White House's initial proposal when asked about comments from McConnell opposing it.  ""Does he disagree that our nation's infrastructure is outdated and needs repair? Does he disagree that we need to do more to put American workers back to work and to invest in industries that have growth potential over the long term? Does he disagree that one-third of the country who doesn't have broadband access should have access to broadband?"" Psaki said. ""There are a lot of areas where there is agreement with across the political spectrum.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/biden-spending-plan-billed-as-infrastructure-bill-spends-non-infrastructure
1,Ingraham: Corporations who speak out against Georgia law should be treated as 'enemy of fair elections',"Democrats and big corporations like Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola and Apple are aligned with   and against Americans, Laura Ingraham warned Thursday.  All three companies have gone on the record against what "" "" host described as a ""common-sense""   election law that strengthens identification requirements and expands early voting opportunities across the Peach State. Those mild reforms, Ingraham said, didn't keep Delta CEO Edward Bastian and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey from firing back at Georgia in stark terms. ""We realize that this was restricting ... people's access, particularly in the Black community,"" Bastian said in a recent clip played by Ingraham. ""This is something that's more than money. This is about protecting the voices of our people."" By contrast, the host noted, companies like Coca-Cola recently lobbied against legislation that would have cracked down on imports from countries using slave labor, including China.  ""The love for democracy stops at the U.S. border,"" Ingraham said. Turning to Biden and his support for moving this year's Major League Baseball All-Star Game out of Atlanta, Ingraham asked viewers: ""Remember when Biden claimed he didn't want to wade into the culture wars during the campaign? He was going to unify the country, be the president of all Americans? ""That's obviously out the window. As I warned, they're going to use terms like 'Jim Crow' and they're going to lie but they will never talk about what's actually in the law,"" she added. ""The law requires voter ID for absentee ballots. It eliminates signature matching. It expands early voting opportunities. It keeps ballot drop boxes. It shortens the time between the general election and a runoff. It gives the state bar the power to remove corrupt election officials. These rules benefit Americans of every race."" Ingraham claimed the far left was ""working hand in glove with Hollywood, sports personalities, and big business to bully and intimidate Georgia for passing a law that they believe threatens Democrats' dreams of permanent rule."" In response, she said, ""every Republican member of Congress -- every single one, the House and the Senate, even Mitt Romney, every Republican governor -- should immediately speak out against this campaign."" Then, she said, ""it's time to teach corporate America that if they attack Georgia or any state like it for doing what they did to secure their right to vote, these corporations are going to face the wrath of GOP officials as well as the tens of millions of American consumers who support them. ""We will analyze every benefit you get under state and local law and eliminate as many of them as possible. If you threaten to leave for a blue state, we will hold open the door and bid you farewell. Pay their huge taxes. See if we care,"" she warned. ""Enjoy trying to comply with their antibusiness regulations. But don't ever ask us for help again when the left comes after you. Because you're going to be the enemy of fair elections and you're going to be treated as such.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/laura-ingraham-georgia-election-law-biden-delta-apple-coca-cola

4,Former Trump aide Max Miller raised 500K in one month in House race vs GOP member who voted to impeach," Max Miller, the former   aide mounting a primary challenge to     Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, raised more than $500,000 in approximately the first month of his campaign, Fox News has learned.  The four-week total underscores the powerful fundraising draw of the former president, who held an event for Miller at Trump International in Palm Beach. The average House campaign in 2018 cost about $2 million, according to  . Fox News has learned that Miller received contributions from more than 2,500 donors in all 50 states.  Miller announced his campaign against Gonzalez after the incumbent joined 10 other Republicans to vote to impeach former President Donald Trump for incitement of an insurrection over the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Shortly after Miller entered the race on Feb. 26, Trump enthusiastically endorsed his former aide, whose past roles include a spot on Trump's 2016 campaign, work in the Office of Presidential Personnel and as Deputy Campaign Manager for Presidential Operations.  ""Max Miller is a wonderful person who did a great job at the White House and will be a fantastic Congressman,"" Trump said in a statement through his Save America PAC. ""He is a Marine Veteran, a son of Ohio, and a true PATRIOT."" ""Current Rep. Anthony Gonzalez should not be representing the people of the 16th district because he does not represent their interest or their heart,"" Trump added. ""Max Miller has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"" A representative for Miller, asked about the total the campaign raised at Trump's Palm Beach fundraiser, said the campaign is not disclosing the amount raised at specific events.  As first-quarter 2021 fundraising numbers streamed in on Thursday, it was clear that high-profile support or opposition to Trump helped multiple candidates raise money. Punchbowl News reported that Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., one of Trump's biggest supporters, raised about $500,000 in just four days during a visit to his home state.  Meanwhile, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who voted to impeach Trump and has made his name as a vocal Trump critic,   in the first quarter of 2021 -- $1.1 million for each his campaign and his political action committee.  Trump has said that he plans to back primary challenges to a variety of Republicans who have not been loyal enough to him. He's publicly called for voters in Wyoming, for example, to oust House GOP Conference Chair  Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in 2022.  Cheney is also the state's lone House member in Congress.  ""The good news is in her state she's been censured and in her state her poll numbers have dropped faster than any human being I've ever seen,"" Trump said in his speech at CPAC. ""So hopefully they'll get rid of her with the next election.""  Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile,   at CPAC that there are ""plenty"" of Senate Republicans he would like to see primary challenges against and that his father will ""get involved in picking individual races and individual people that have been supportive of him, and not others.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/former-trump-aide-max-miller-raised-500k-in-one-month-in-race-against-gop-member-who-voted-to-impeach

""I absolutely oppose and reject any notion of boycotting Georgia,"" Ossoff said. ""Georgia welcomes business, investment, jobs, opportunity, and events. In fact, economic growth is driving much of the political progress we have seen here. Georgia welcomes the world’s business. Corporations disgusted like we are with the disgraceful Voter Suppression bill should stop any financial support to Georgia’s Republican Party, which is abusing its power to make it harder for Americans to vote."" Ossoff first made the comments during a press conference in Atlanta Thursday and the senator's office confirmed the statement to Fox News on Friday.  Biden has called the new voting law ""sick"" and ""Jim Crow on steroids."" After a record-breaking turnout that led to Democrats winning Georgia in the presidential race and two Senate runoffs, the GOP-led Georgia legislature passed the new voting rules that supporters say will add integrity to the election system, but Democrats fiercely opposed as voter suppression tactics. The recently enacted law places new restrictions on voting by mail, adds voter ID requirements and limits ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting ahead of general elections, an increase from just one, and leaves two Sundays as optional. The law also bans outside groups from handing out food or water to those waiting in line to vote.  In addition to the pressure on sports, leaders of Coca-Cola and Delta, both headquartered in Atlanta, have made public statements in opposition to the new voting law.  Georgia's other newly elected Democratic senator, Raphael Warnock, on Sunday declined to oppose potential boycotts of Georgia-based corporations and sporting events, saying, ""We will see how that plays out."" In an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Warnock said he's ""not focused"" on the boycotts. ""I am focused on what I can do as a United States senator.""

9,Experts giving COVID 'lab leak' theory second look after mainstream media cried it was 'debunked',"Once dismissed by the   as a ""fringe"" and ""debunked"" theory, the suggestion that the devastating   leaked from a   superlab instead of jumping from animals to humans is no longer considered outlandish. Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director   said last week   the pathogen unintentionally escaped from a lab in Wuhan, a city known as a center for Chinese viral studies. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has also been known to perform experiments on bat coronaviruses. A repeatedly delayed joint World Health Organization-China investigation   the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"" last week, but experts are already questioning its conclusions due to the influence of the notoriously deceitful Chinese government. Even the head of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, much maligned for his   toward China at the outset of the pandemic, said the research team’s assessment on whether the virus entered the human population following a laboratory incident was not "" "" and requires further investigation. Numerous media outlets dismissed the idea last year, however, when it was initially   by  , R-Ark. The pushback against Cotton occurred during denunciations of Trump administration figures framing COVID-19 as a ""Chinese"" or ""Wuhan"" virus. Stories published by The   (""conspiracy theory that was already debunked""),   (""fringe theory""),   (""debunked fringe theory""), and   (""conspiracy theory"") aggressively disputed Cotton's hypothesis.  MSNBC host Brian Williams cited the Post on his program on Feb. 17, 2020, saying, ""Arkansas Republican Senator and loyal Trump ally Tom Cotton has waded into trouble by commenting on the coronavirus, which is proving virulent and deadly and is spreading fast. The Washington Post headline puts it this way: 'Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.'""  linked the theory to efforts by President Donald Trump to attack China over the virus outbreak, declaring it ""added a scary new layer to Donald Trump’s blame-China strategy."" HuffPost   that Cotton made ""unfounded allegations"" against the Chinese government for failing to stop the spread of the coronavirus, one of the most embarrassing examples of a liberal news outlet parroting pro-China propaganda to ding a conservative. Indeed,   China's authoritarian government silenced physicians and whistleblowers in the critical early weeks of the pandemic. The outlets at times conflated Cotton's belief it could have come from a lab with the notion China purposefully engineered a bio-weapon, which Redfield and Cotton have said they do not believe occurred. Rather, Redfield said the coronavirus's highly effective transmission ability suggested to him it had been experimented on in a laboratory. Liberal media figures, such as the Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin and Daily Beast's Molly Jong-Fast, delighted in piling on Cotton. ""The far right has now found its own virus conspiracy theory,"" left-wing CNN host Fareed Zakaria said on March 8, 2020, of Cotton's remarks. Three days later, CNN's John Vause declared Cotton's comments ""misinformation"" while interviewing infecious disease expert  . ""Well, I'm not going to comment about what any individual says. But in general, I can tell you that theories that are not based on evidence and facts often can really mislead people,"" Fauci said at the time. The Post   in 2020 that the U.S. State Department warned in 2018 of inadequate safety measures at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where bat coronavirus experiments were taking place. Cotton told  "" Monday that the ""best evidence"" to him, while circumstantial, indicates the virus originated from an ""accidental breach"" in a Wuhan lab. ""Tens of millions of Americans have had their lives upended over the last year. They have lost jobs. Their businesses have closed,"" he said. ""They have lost loved ones. I don't think those Americans want to simply turn the page and let bygones be bygones. We need to get to the bottom of what happened in Wuhan and how the Chinese Communists unleashed this plague on the world and we need to hold them accountable.""

""The move was initially delayed to allow for repairs to the home that are more easily conducted with the home unoccupied,"" Sanders announced on Twitter. The vice president and her husband have been temporarily staying at Blair House, the president's guest quarters on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House.  The official residence of the vice president is located roughly three miles from the White House at the Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington, D.C.

12,A different Augusta National await newcomers from November,"Paul Casey needed only 11 holes to realize a Masters in November was an experience unlike any other at Augusta National. He had a 6-iron to a left pin on the par-5 second hole at Augusta National. Any other year — any April, really — he would have aimed well right of the flag. On this soft, autumn day, he took on the pin. The ball plopped down 6 feet away. ""You can't hit that shot in April,"" he said. ""That shot in April would have one-hopped over into the patrons."" Consider that a warning. For all but 19 players in the field, the Masters back in April should feel like it usually does. There are pins to attack. There are pins to avoid. It doesn't take much to get out of position. For someone like Sebastian Munoz, who made his debut last year, it could be about starting over. Munoz is among 13 players who played the Masters for the first time last November when it was postponed seven months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He had gone to Augusta National once before for a scouting trip after qualifying by winning the Sanderson Farms Championship. Just his luck, that practice round was in November, too. ""I think that's why I played good. I knew what to expect,"" Munoz said. He was 9-under par through 54 holes until closing with a 75 to tie for 19th. Sungjae Im set the record for lowest score by a newcomer at 15-under 273, a score that would have won all but eight of the previous 84 Masters. Munoz still recalls what Jon Rahm told him in the final round after one particular shot, a 4-iron into the par-5 15th that landed just in front of the hole and settled not far behind it: ""Anything you learn today, this week, forget about it."" ""I'm looking forward to it and debuting again,"" Munoz said with a laugh. Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 was the last player to win the Masters in his debut. Only three professionals — Carlos Ortiz, Robert MacIntyre and Will Zalatoris — and three amateurs are first-timers at this Masters. As for the 13 who have never played in April? It's not like they didn't gain any experience at all. ""I don't think we played a golf course that was similar,"" said Max Homa, who missed the cut. ""It was still nice to get out there and get the jitters over with. It's also a golf course I think everyone has watched more than any golf course on tour. You know a lot of spots where you need to leave it. You still saw where it can get you. ""I don't think it was rocket science that it was playing different,"" he said. ""I threw a 3-iron into 15 and it stopped on a dime. We knew that would happen. The best players in the world are really good at adapting."" The 15th hole gets most of the attention. That's where Rahm hit the 4-iron and Homa hit the 3-iron that stopped. Johnson spoke of one player in his group to hit a 3-wood that stopped where it landed, a shot he said that without an abundance of rain ""is not possible."" Adam Scott considered what the newcomers learned last year, such as the severe slope on the 13th fairway with the ball above their feet (for right-handed players) and various lines off the tee. ""Certainly, they're going to be seeing a few new shots that they'll have an opportunity to play, and some that you absolutely can't play,"" he said. The soft conditions of autumn — along with rain that forced a three-hour delay at the start — were reflected in the record scores, from the 20-under 268 by Johnson to the 1,122 birdies for the week. Justin Thomas believes Johnson would have won in any conditions. He was playing that well. What stood out to Thomas was the number of newcomers who did so well. Along with Im sharing second place, C.T. Pan tied for seventh and Abraham Ancer was in the mix until closing with a 76 to tie for 13th. ""I don't think it's a coincidence that some first-timers or younger guys played well, because a lot of the past experience was engrained in my memory,"" Thomas said. ""But at the end of the day, everyone had the same amount of time to prepare. Everyone knew what the golf course was, and it just about execution. But you had to go about differently than you do in April when it gets firm and fast."" Lanto Griffin played the opening two rounds with former Masters champion Vijay Singh, with whom he plays and practices at home in Florida. The stories were familiar. Griffin spoke of a 5-iron from the rough on No. 5 that came out hot, landed in the middle of the green and rolled harmlessly to the fringe. Singh told him that ball would have gone into the magnolia trees in April. ""I think it's easier when it goes from being really firm and fast to softer, versus soft and slow and then it speeds up,"" Griffin said. ""I know this year will be a completely different animal.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/a-different-augusta-national-await-newcomers-from-november

The Heisman Trophy-winning wide receiver seemed to have little left to prove for NFL teams on the field, but showed up Tuesday to help Jones out. Jones threw a series of different routes, including some deep balls, to players like favored targets Smith and tailback Najee Harris in his second outing before NFL personnel that included several head coaches and general managers. Smith was a late addition to the target list, though he's already regarded as a likely Top 10 pick. ""He didn't have to do that,"" Jones told the SEC Network, which aired the pro day. ""You watch the tape and he's great. But he called me this morning (Tuesday) and was like, ‘Dude, I got you. Let’s just get a couple of routes in.'"" Jones showcased his arm strength a week after participating in the  . He had a scripted series of some 60 throws, about a quarter of them deep ones. Jones said he had different plans prepared in case Smith and/or Jaylen Waddle participated, or if neither of them did. Waddle, also one of the top receiving prospects, didn't work out at the pro day. Smith had earlier indicated that he didn't plan to, either. Jones and Smith connected on several deep balls, continuing the smooth connection they displayed in the regular season. Smith said he wanted to show a finger he injured in the national championship game was healed. It kept him from playing or practicing at the Senior Bowl. At pro day, he said, ""The competitiveness came out in me."" So did the loyalty. ""Mac was just on me like, ‘Bro, come catch, come catch, come catch,’"" Smith told the network.

Belichick was among a group of five general managers on hand, joined by the 49ers John Lynch, the Saints’ Mickey Loomis, the New York Jets' Joe Douglas and the Bears' Ryan Pace. Harris displayed the hands that helped him catch 43 passes as a senior before doing individual running back drills.

14,WWII vet knits wool hats during COVID-19 pandemic for Salvation Army,"A 96-year-old World War II veteran has dedicated the past 24 years of his life to   for those in need.  Once they're complete, Tom Cornish told Fox News he would send them to food shelters, hospitals, churches and to the homeless men and women he would see on the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota.  However, for the past six years, he's been directing his efforts to help the Salvation Army, which has been in desperate need of volunteers throughout the course of the pandemic.  Over the last year alone, Cornish said he's created at least 350 wool hats for the organization.  ""[Tom Cornish] believes that there is no retirement in your service,"" his daughter-in-law Marilyn Cornish told Fox News. ""You can serve all your life. There is no reason you should stop giving and serving."" Tom Cornish lives in the Twin Cities and has been volunteering since he was in high school. Knitting, however, was something he picked up 24 years ago after one of his kids bought him yarn and some loom, his son, Gerald Cornish, told Fox News.  On a good day, Tom Cornish can create a little more than two hats. Each one takes about four hours to complete, he says.  It's no easy task, but if you asked him, he'd joke: ""I've got nothing else better to do.""  His biggest motivation is giving back.  ""If I sit and look out the window, I would get something out of it but no one else would,"" he said. ""When I make hats or once in a while scarfs, someone is going to get a big benefit out of that."" And he's got plenty of yarn to do it. He said he still has three full boxes with other bags in his closet.  The Salvation Army, which has been giving the hats to hundreds of individuals within the Twin Cities, is in awe of his efforts.  ""Tom is an inspiration to us,"" added Lt. Colonel Dan Jennings, commander of The Salvation Army Northern Division. ""Here is a man who just wants to help people, and he is doing it the best way he knows how."" Jennings said Tom Cornish is evidence that ""everyone can do something to help those less fortunate."" And Tom Cornish has no plans of slowing down anytime soon.  ""I'm going to do this until I take my last breath,"" he said. ",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//us/wwii-vet-covid-pandemic-weaving-wool-hats-salvation-army
15,High court sympathetic to college athletes in NCAA dispute,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to give college athletes a win in a dispute with the NCAA over rules limiting their education-related compensation. With the   in its final stages, the high court heard arguments in a case about how   who play Division I basketball and football. Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and the scholarship money colleges can offer is capped at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA defends its rules as necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports. But the   including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, say the NCAA’s rules are unfair and violate federal antitrust law designed to promote competition. The outcome will help determine how college athletes are compensated and whether schools can offer tens of thousands of dollars in education benefits for things such as postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad opportunities and vocational school payments. During an hour and a half of   conducted  , both liberal and conservative justices   to students. Justice Elena Kagan suggested that what was going on sounded a lot like price fixing. ""Schools that are naturally competitors ... have all gotten together in an organization,"" she said, and used their power to ""fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed. He told a lawyer for the NCAA that ""it does seem ... schools are conspiring with competitors ... to pay no salaries for the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing."" Kavanaugh said that was ""somewhat disturbing."" A ruling for the former players would not necessarily mean an immediate infusion of cash to current college athletes. It would mean that the NCAA could not bar schools from sweetening their offers to Division I basketball and football athletes with additional education-related benefits. Individual athletic conferences could still set limits. Still, if the athletes were to win, there would be pressure on schools to offer additional benefits, and that could create bidding wars for the best players. The NCAA says that could turn off fans and erase the distinction between professional and college sports. Whatever happens at the high court, changes seem on the way for how college athletes are compensated. The NCAA is in the process of trying to amend its rules to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses. That would allow athletes to earn money for things like sponsorship deals, online endorsement and personal appearances. For some athletes, those amounts could dwarf any education-related benefits. The former college athletes have some big-time supporters. The players associations of the NFL, NBA and WNBA all urged the justices to side with the ex-athletes, as did the Biden administration. So far, the former players have won every round of the case. A decision in the case is expected before the end of June, when the high court traditionally breaks for summer.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/high-court-sympathetic-to-college-athletes-in-ncaa-dispute
16,Psaki doubles down on Biden's Georgia voting comments after major fact-check," press secretary Jen Psaki furthered the president's criticism of   new voting law even after a fact check determined his line of attack was false. President Biden had claimed that Georgia's law blocked people from providing voters with food and water while the stood in line. He also accused the Republican-led state was ending voting at 5 p.m., ""when people are just getting off work."" Georgia's law actually standardizes what's considered ""normal business hours"" to mean 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but still allowed counties to extend their voting hours to as early as 7 a.m. and as late as 7 p.m. It also allows poll workers to provide self-service water from an unattended receptacle within 150 feet but prohibits people from actively distributing food and drink within that distance.  On Thursday, Psaki didn't back down from Biden's comments, but rather defended them. ""It standardizes the ending of voting every day at five, right?"" Psaki asked FOX Business' Edward Lawrence while referring to the law. ""It just gives options. It gives options to expand it, right, but it standardized it at five. It also makes it so that outside groups can’t provide water or food to people in line, right?"" Her comments came after   gave Biden four pinocchios for his claim about voting times. ""Biden framed his complaint in terms of a slap at working people,"" The Post's Glenn Kessler wrote. ""The law would 'end voting at five o'clock when working people are just getting off work' or 'ends voting hours early so working people can't cast their vote after their shift is over.'"" ""Many listeners might assume he was talking about voting on Election Day, not early voting. But Election Day hours were not changed. As for early voting, the law made a modest change, replacing a vague 'normal business hours' — presumed to be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — to a more specific 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time period. But that's the minimum.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/psaki-doubles-down-georgia-voting-law

18,"Trout, Pujols lead Angels' late rally past White Sox, 4-3","Mike Trout smacked a single down the left-field line to drive in David Fletcher in the eighth inning, and Angel Stadium rocked with the roar of a crowd much bigger than the 13,207 masked people in attendance. The  ' first opening day win since 2013 felt big in almost every way to a team and a sport that could use some good news. Trout delivered the tying single and Shohei Ohtani scored the go-ahead run on Albert Pujols' groundout in the eighth inning, leading Los Angeles' rally to a 4-3 victory over the   on Thursday night. Max Stassi homered and Justin Upton had an RBI single in the Angels' first opening day at home since 2016. The Halos' late surge for two unearned runs thrilled Angel Stadium's first crowd since 2019, ended their embarrassing losing streak on opening day — and even spoiled the second debut of White Sox manager Tony La Russa. ""Felt like big league baseball again. It was great,"" Angels manager Joe Maddon said. ""(The) 13,000 fans felt like 40, 50, 60,000. ... Just a brilliant performance. For an opening night, that’s as good as it’s going to get with your team. If we keep playing that type of baseball, we’re going to win a lot of games."" Trout and Pujols came up big in the eighth against powerful Chicago reliever Aaron Bummer (0-1) in front of the biggest sports crowd in the Los Angeles metroplex since the start of the pandemic. ""It was nice having the fans back in the stands,"" Upton said. ""There was a lot of energy, and it kind of locks you in. Bummer has got great stuff, and we were just trying to fight him."" Fletcher opened the eighth by beating out an infield single off Bummer's glove. Second baseman Nick Madrigal then made a throwing error on a hard-hit grounder from Ohtani, and Fletcher took third on a passed ball before Trout smacked a single to left. Upton drew an 11-pitch walk to load the bases for Pujols, whose high-bouncing groundout easily scored Ohtani. Pujols’ RBI was the 16th of his career on opening day, the most among active players. ""(Bummer) does his job, gets groundballs, and the last run scored was on a chopper,"" La Russa said. ""That’s baseball. If you put the ball in play, good things happen, and it happened for them."" Mike Mayers (1-0) pitched the eighth, and Raisel Iglesias needed just eight pitches in the ninth to earn the save in his Angels debut. Adam Eaton hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in his first game back with the White Sox. Lucas Giolito retired the Angels’ first 11 batters and pitched two-hit ball into the sixth inning for Chicago. The Southern California native baffled the Angels’ lineup his first time through, striking out six of nine largely with his changeup. Giolito left with a 3-2 lead, but the Angels jumped on Bummer and kept new closer Liam Hendriks out of the game. ""Giolito threw a heck of a game and put us in position to win,"" Eaton said. ""Trout is barreling on 96 (mph), and Upton comes up and puts a really good at-bat together. Circumstances were tough, but that’s kind of how we drew it up for our (pitchers)."" Dylan Bundy yielded six hits and three runs with six strikeouts over six innings in his first opening day start for the Angels. White Sox: OF Adam Engel went on the 10-day injured list with a strained right hamstring, and LHP Jace Fry was placed on the 10-day IL to recover from a microdiscectomy. Angels: Ohtani’s potential blister on his throwing hand shouldn’t affect his ability to pitch Sunday, Maddon said. The 76-year-old La Russa is back in Chicago’s dugout 34 years after he was fired and nine years after he last managed in the majors with Pujols and the Cardinals. La Russa was a special adviser to the Angels’ front office last season. La Russa’s first significant strategy decision of the season perhaps showed a willingness to change with the times: He pulled Giolito after 87 pitches in the sixth inning so he wouldn’t face Trout a third time. Pujols went 0 for 4 with one huge RBI in the 21st opening day start of his career. The 41-year-old Pujols matched Eddie Murray and Al Kaline for the second-most opening day starts in baseball history, trailing only Pete Rose’s 23. Pujols is one of five players to make at least 10 opening day starts with the Angels. Garret Anderson holds the franchise record with 13, while Trout has started the last nine straight. Fletcher began his fourth big league season by going 1 for 4 with two uncharacteristic strikeouts as the Angels’ leadoff hitter and second baseman. He signed  earlier in the day. Dallas Keuchel looks to extend his career-long mastery over the Angels when he takes the mound against Andrew Heaney. Keuchel is 12-2 with a 3.36 ERA in 18 appearances against Los Angeles.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/trout-pujols-lead-angels-late-rally-past-white-sox-4-3
19,Emmert promises WBCA he will work to fix 'stark' inequities,"NCAA President Mark Emmert promised the Women's Basketball Coaches Association he will work with coaches to fix the ""stark difference"" between the Division I men's and women's tournaments. While Emmert noted that a major hurdle was trying to hold both basketball tournaments in kind of identical format required by the coronavirus pandemic, he added nobody liked the results and nobody wants to see similar issues crop up in other sports in coming months. ""I, too, believe that it’s exactly the right moment to do it,"" Emmert said. ""You got my commitment, my personal commitment to spend an enormous amount of time and energy on on this problem and and making sure that we don’t lose the chance."" Emmert and the NCAA's heads of basketball Dan Gavitt and Lynn Holzman discussed the conditions in San Antonio on Wednesday with members of the WBCA, including two of the Final Four coaches — UConn's Geno Auriemma and Dawn Staley of South Carolina. Several differences surfaced over the past two weeks, starting with female players, coaches and staff in San Antonio criticizing the NCAA for not initially providing a full weight-training area to the women’s teams, noting the men’s teams in Indianapolis did not have the same problem. Questions during the coaches' meeting with Emmert ranged from the use of ""March Madness"" for branding, the number of NCAA staffers for both basketball tournaments (12 for the men, six for the women), the budget for both tournaments and why the NCAA doesn't own the WNIT as it does the NIT. The WBCA sent a letter to Emmert last week saying the external review he proposed to look into potential gender equity issues wasn't good enough. In the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, the WBCA asked for a ""Commission on Gender Inequity in College Sports"" led by people chosen by both the WBCA and NCAA. Staley asked for assurances that the law firm hired by the NCAA to review potential gender equity issues is truly independent. ""Whoever is paying the piper, more than likely they’re going to give you what you want to hear,"" Staley said. Emmert said the Kaplan, Hecker & Fink law firm specializes in Title IX issues nationally and has no prior relationship with the NCAA. E  the firm would review potential gender equity issues in all men’s and women’s championship events with basketball a key focus. Muffett McGraw, who retired as Notre Dame head coach last year, said the WBCA has total confidence in Holzman. The former Irish coach noted the NCAA added a rule a few years ago holding head coaches accountable for anything that goes wrong and asked why Holzman doesn't report directly to Emmert. ""In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio,"" McGraw said. ""This is way deeper than that."" Auriemma said the bigger issue isn't an NCAA problem but exists on individual campuses with presidents and athletic directors. He asked Emmert what he could do to make sure those people give women's basketball the same advantages and opportunities. The UConn coach also mentioned how football coaches broke away from NCAA control. ""Maybe that’s what has to happen in women’s basketball?"" Auriemma said. ""Maybe women’s basketball has got to separate itself from the other women’s sports? But then that would be unfair because we would be leaving a lot of people behind that need our help."" Georgia Tech coach Nell Fortner, who  , asked about the use of the March Madness logos. Emmert told her he's been studying the branding but there currently is no legal or contractual restraints. Fortner said the use of ""March Madness"" and other branding was like ""eye candy"" that makes a viewer stop and watch on TV. Yet for the women's Sweet 16 and Elite Eight, only ""NCAA Women's Basketball"" was in the middle of the court. She also argued the women are a huge potential revenue stream with TV numbers backing that up. ""We're going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we really don’t step up to the plate at the NCAA as a whole to really water this sport, to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,"" Fortner said.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/emmert-promises-wbca-he-will-work-to-fix-stark-inequities
20,NFL veteran Colt McCoy linked to 'Eyes of Texas' alumni pressure on university to keep song,"Veteran NFL quarterback Colt McCoy was reportedly a part of an alumni-charged effort to persuade the   to keep its spirit song ""Eyes of Texas"" amid pushback over alleged racist ties. McCoy, along with former NFL player Jordan Shipley and several other powerful alumni, was a part of emails discussing the backlash against the song in June, the   reported, citing emails the publication obtained. McCoy was reportedly on a conference call with energy entrepreneur Bud Brigham and other alums to talk about the song and come up with other ideas to remedy the situation. Scott Ingraham, another Texas alumnus, told those on the email chain the group should contact school president Jay Hartzell and athletic director Chris Del Conte and steer them away from making an immediate decision, according to the Texas Tribune. Ingraham also suggested that the school create a task force to review the song. ""A diverse group to illuminate the history and also the value of the song for ALL the stakeholders would be a healthy and beneficial process, as opposed to what is happening now with demands, or else,"" Brigham reportedly wrote to Hartzell on June 29. According to the newspaper, Brigham also wrote that the former Longhorns quarterback might suggest a task force to Del Conte. The committee was formed and a determination was made, but University of Texas at Austin spokesman J.B. Bird told the newspaper that the committee wasn’t formed due to alumni suggestions. McCoy did not comment on the story and the extent of his influence was not clear. He recently signed a one-year deal with the  . Hartzell declined to comment. On Monday, the Texas NAACP, along with Black Texas elected officials, some civil rights leaders, and Texas students and alumni held a press conference to announce their fight for the school to stop using the song, according to  . Critics of the song have said the ""Eyes of Texas"" has Confederacy ties. A 58-page report on the song was released by the university in March. A 24-person panel that convened to determine the meaning behind the song’s roots, lyrics and history   and striving toward excellence. The title of the song was reportedly taken from a favored saying of a former school president who had mimicked remarks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and was performed by musicians in blackface at minstrel shows. However, the panel could not find a direct link to the line ""the eyes of Texas are upon you"" and Lee. While alumni expressed issues with players not standing and participating in the playing of the song, Hartzell said in March that no student-athlete would be mandated to do so. ""Nobody has been, or will be, required to sing the song,"" Hartzell said. ""That's going to be going forward the way we continue to operate. We hope that as people go through the report, read through the facts, they'll find ways to participate in some way. Whether it's the case of the athletes standíng on the field, or the fans in the stands as we sing, there's going to be no punishment, no mandate, no requirement if people choose not to participate.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/nfl-colt-mccoy-eyes-of-texas-alumni-pressure-song
21,"Some cars are cheaper than they used to be, Consumer Reports study finds","The average price paid for   and trucks in the U.S. has reached record levels, but that doesn’t necessarily mean cars have gotten more expensive. In some cases, they’re technically cheaper than they were decades ago,  . The organization took a look at the 1,900 cars it has purchased for testing over the past four decades and discovered that, when adjusted for inflation, the prices for most had dropped significantly or stayed the same. For example, in 1996 it bought a   Camry for $20,509.31 that would be $33,220.09 now, while the latest Toyota Camry Hybrid it purchased cost $29,000. Similarly, a 1993 Corolla was $15,331, or $28,122.82 today, which would get you a fully-loaded top-of-the-line 2021 model.

The report noted that the prices paid for trucks have gone up considerably, but that the vehicles are more retail-oriented and packed with more comfort and convenience features than in the past. The growth in high-end truck and luxury vehicle sales is largely behind the increase in average transaction prices that have made headlines and are now near $38,000, according to  .

Two sources familiar with internal data confirmed the estimate to Fox News, with one agent saying: ""We’ve never seen anything like this before."" While only a projection, if accurate it would be the highest number of UACs on record, and more than twice the 76,020 encountered during the 2019 border crisis -- during which the Trump administration was hammered for its handling of the crisis and detention of children.  The Biden administration has declined to call the surge in numbers -- set to eclipse the 2019 crisis on multiple metrics -- a ""crisis,"" describing it instead as a ""challenge"" and blaming the numbers on deteriorating conditions in Central America and the overwhelming situation at the border on the Trump   of legal asylum pathways. There are currently nearly 5,000 children in Border Patrol custody and more than 13,000 in Health and Human Services custody. CBP, meanwhile, encountered more than 100,000 migrants in February, and that number is expected to have risen in March. President Biden has also downplayed the number of migrants coming to the border. ""The truth of the matter is nothing has changed,"" he said at a recent press conference. ""It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year."" Republicans have insisted that it is a crisis, and blamed it on the rolling back by Biden of Trump-era border protections such as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which kept migrants in Mexico while they awaited their hearings, and asylum cooperative agreements signed with Northern Triangle countries. His administration has also limited Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) priorities and halted construction of the border wall. There has been increased scrutiny of the administration’s handling of child migrants in recent days as both Republicans and journalists toured the facility in Donna, Texas, which is at 1700 percent capacity and images showed migrants packed in tiny ""pods.""

23,"New homebuyers are seeking old homes, unaware of how costly renovations can be"," is all romance until it’s time to escape from your creditor. With a large share of the nation’s workforce continuing to work remotely, many used their downtime last year to fulfill their dream of   far from plague-ridden urban centers. Data from Realtor.com shows that sales of homes built more than 100 years ago rose by 16% in 2020 in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) compared to last year, with a median sale price of $236,000. During the same period, New York City saw a sales decline of 6% overall. ""The biggest ask right now is ‘something old with character’ — newer homes have none of the richness or the stories of something built in 1814,"" New York-based Compass agent Adam Carroll told The Post. Viral social media accounts like Elizabeth and Ethan Finkelstein’s   feed on Instagram — which spotlights dilapidated properties for sale for less than $100,000 and boasts 1.5 million followers — fanned the flames, galvanizing real estate markets in historic areas across the country. But while ""cheap old house"" buyers may see ""good bones"" when they pick up a stunning Queen Anne or a cool Craftsman bungalow, experts warn that restoring these money pits to their former glory requires serious know-how and a fat checking account. Four months ago, attorney Stephen Simcock, 58, found out firsthand. He purchased a 170-year-old waterfront fixer-upper in the Hudson Valley when the pandemic changed his work/life balance. He declined to reveal the exact cost of his new retreat, but he paid more than three times the area’s median listing price of $775,000, according to Realtor.com. ""I might have legal title, but I’m joining its story,"" said Simcock of the Greek Revival property in the hamlet of Barrytown, New York. A 4,200-square-foot former ice store, complete with the ghost foundations of demolished storage houses dotted across its 1½-acre grounds, the four-bedroom home boasts a torrid history. ""In its various iterations, this house has been a store, definitely a hotel, maybe a brothel, a halfway house, a college dorm and then a single-family house,"" he paused, laughing, ""I like to think I bring a little of all of that."" Simcock said he knew what he was getting into when he bought the house. For instance, he knew that he would add bathrooms, open up the kitchen and replace the small, heat-conserving windows, typical of their time, with large frames to maximize his water views. ""The goal is for it to become a really beautiful country house, having accreted so much charm over the years, but with more creature comforts,"" he said. All of those elements came with costly challenges. But it was the antique beadboard (vertically grooved wall panels) that caught him by surprise. The decorative wood molding, which runs down his stairway, had been stripped from most of the walls. Simply identifying the specific style of board has been a challenge; finding matching replacements has been a head-scratcher. Hunting down matches for rare newel posts and spindles (the decoratively turned supports on a staircase or railing) was also difficult. ""I’m a dilettante, but I’m doing it with as much rigor as I can."" Simcock said.

26,"Jen Shah’s house—the infamous ‘Shah Ski Chalet’—is an alleged fraud, too",""" "" star  , was   for  . But her alleged victims weren’t the only ones getting faked out — so were Bravo fans. The 47-year-old breakout star quickly became notorious for her flamboyant fashions and her friendship faux pas — both equally loud — on Season 1 of the latest entry in the ""Real Housewives"" franchise. However, the $3.9 million Salt Lake City rental she grandly passed off as the ""SHAH SKI CHALET"" actually never belonged to Shah, The Post has learned.  Instead the 9,420-square-foot home featured on the show is owned by the Texas-based real-estate rental company, Univesco Inc., which is under the limited liability company RJW Capital Investors.  Yes, it was (GASP!) a rental: Property records discovered by The Post reveal Univesco Inc. has owned the home since 2014. And as any true fan knows, in the ""Real Housewives"" universe, few things are more shameful than renting your own home. After all,  once   those who choose to rent. ""I don’t understand the concept of renting at all,"" the ""Real Housewives"" executive producer, 52,   in 2019. ""It’s just throwing money away. Especially a huge home. I don’t get it."" Steven Frey of Univesco told The Post she had no idea that Shah had been hyping the property as her own on the show. A separate spokesperson handling their Utah properties exclusively is expected to provide more details at a later time. Bravo itself may have also been deceived, considering they did not shy away from promoting the chalet on the show, including a  (Reps for the network declined to comment to The Post, but insiders told The Post they were well aware of the rental status.) ""On the November 11 series premiere … Jen Shah hosted a lavish fete at her house, but even before she transformed the abode (which she calls the ""Shah Ski Chalet"") for her castmate Meredith Marks’ birthday, our jaws dropped over her insanely gorgeous home,"" the article gushed. Although it went largely unnoticed at the time, speculation that one of the housewives from the show was renting a property to film   and podcasts. But there was even gossip in the housewives’ inner circle: On a Feb. 12, 2020 episode of  hosted by ""Real Housewives of Dallas"" star Brandi Redmond and Stephanie Hollman, Redmond revealed that she knew someone from the ""RHOSLC"" was renting. ""I do know that one of those ladies is renting a house,"" ginger-maned Redmond teased ominously. ""I don’t know [who it is] because I don’t know the cast but I do know that one of them is a renter because they’re renting some friends of mine’s home."" Shah reacted in her signature over-the-top style to Redmond’s comments on Instagram — after a helpful fan page shared an audio clip of her comments. ""Is this what everyone is getting their g-string up their a** about bcuz [sic] their irrelevant? Or is it bcuz they wish they could afford to pay the rent plus own 4 other homes and have an apt in NYC?"" Shah wrote in the comment section of a now-deleted Instagram post at the time. In a later post she continued to wax poetic: ""You want to come for me with your red hair and bulls–t, come harder honey. You’re about to get a taste of SHAH SQUAD and I don’t mess around. PERIODT."" Note: The Post could find no documentation to substantiate Shah’s claims of owning four other properties and an apartment in NYC. However, the sprawling chalet home featured on Bravo was up for sale in 2019, until the five-bedroom, six-bathroom spread was taken off-market — apparently during the time Shah began filming for the show, according to documents. According to the listing, the timber frame home is equipped with ""three substantial master suites, each with its own fireplace and sitting area, and two additional bedroom suites."" However, off of reality TV, and in actual reality, Shah’s longtime home is located in Sandy, Utah, which she owned with her husband, Sharrieff Shah, from 2004 until she sold it at a loss in June 2020. They initially purchased the home for only $302,069. It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states. Her on-set debacle is a far cry from January, when Shah  , announcing she was launching a program dubbed ""Social Commerce,"" to assist women in need amid the  . ""We’re helping women pivot and shift their business through the quarantine and COVID,"" she explained at the time. ""To helping them still stabilize their business through online sales because their brick and mortar stores are closed… We’ve been working with some ladies, so you’ll see some of that coming out and hearing their stories and seeing how we help their businesses grow.""

The 21-year-old uploaded a new   on the platform Thursday taking full responsibility for flirting or sexting (sexually explicit texting) with minors. ""I was being reckless,"" he said, confirming that at least two interactions with minors took place. ""These conversations should have never happened.""  He explained how he added both minors on Snapchat and ""asked how old they were right away, was told that they were 18, believed them, engaged in flirty conversation and then, later on, found out that they were 16."" Charles said he's ""embarrassed"" and when the truth came out about their age, he ""blocked both people."" ""I needed to take accountability for my actions and more importantly apologize to the people that were affected by them,"" the Internet personality said.  In March, multiple minors came forward on social media and shared screenshots of their alleged conversations with Charles. Some claimed he asked them for nude photographs and/or sent them explicit photos and messages.  The beauty guru, who has over 25 million YouTube subscribers, admitted he believed the individuals were older. ""I trusted the information that was given to me rather than the information I could have and should have gotten myself,"" Charles said. ""As I did more research on this topic and self-reflected, I realized that the receipts and the screenshots and the specific details of the interaction don't matter, because I f---ed up and I need to take accountability for my actions and apologize to the people who were affected by them."" The makeup artist added how he's now understanding the unbalanced power dynamic between a celebrity and a fan. ""A power imbalance can happen even when it's not intentional,"" he reasoned. ""What I wasn't getting before is that the excitement that comes with talking to a celebrity is literally enough to make somebody do or say something they normally wouldn't. Even if that celebrity isn't even intentionally weaponizing their fame, money or power. That's a concept I just wasn't getting, but I now do.""  Charles concluded his video by announcing he's going to take a break from social media to ""further reflect and educate myself on these topics.""",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//entertainment/youtube-james-charles-addresses-allegations-sexted-teen-boys

The flight engineer and Expeditions 64 and 65 crew member will launch that Friday from   Baikonur Cosmodrome alongside   cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov. Speaking with Fox News last week, the 54-year-old said his team had completed the final examinations for activities on both the   and the ISS. Vande Hei noted that   has had a ""big impact"" on the astronauts' training, from wearing masks around others to making sure the virus is not carried up to the space station.  ""We'll be in quarantine, we'll get monitored very frequently to make sure that we're staying  . And then, we'll have time to  , relax, walk around outside. I'm going to try to make sure I spend as much time outside as possible while I still have the chance. And, just make sure I have everything in order before we go,"" he said. ""In addition to that, we will also review a lot of the procedures that we'll be using to actually get to the space station. We'll do those pretty frequently."" Once the three have arrived at the space station, the veteran astronaut expects the first month to ""feel a lot different"" than his previous expedition in 2017.  ""I had a lot of adjusting to do, a lot of lessons to learn how to operate in an environment where the way I normally behave wouldn't work. I lost a lot of things in that first month [and] it was very frustrating and so many things that I could do without any conscious effort on the ground required me to concentrate completely,"" he explained. ""So, I'm hoping a lot of those lessons I learned will come right back to me and I'll be able to start sprinting this time.""

Vande Hei told Fox News that he perceives his   aboard the ISS as being like a laboratory technician and that it's ""interesting work."" ""There are scientists that put a lot of thought into what experiments they want to get done. They're doing the data gathering and the data analysis and writing papers. My job is to facilitate if those things work when it's up there,"" he said. ""I need to make sure that they have the resources they need. If something needs to be troubleshot, I'll help out with the troubleshooting,"" Vande Hei continued. ""Sometimes those scientists will be looking over our shoulder with a video camera and will actually be coaching us on what they want us to do to try to help make things work."" The applied physician pointed out that he himself is ""part of the science experiment"" when discussing NASA's upcoming   to the   and companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and   SpaceX testing commercial spaceflights.  ""So, when we are on the space station that's a capability that we need to maintain somehow. But, we also want to start having these new capabilities, like you mentioned, with the Artemis program,"" said Vande Hei. ""It's going to be really hard if we can't do both of those things, all of those things, if all of the burden of that falls on the  ."" ""So, having ways where we can facilitate this continued capability to put people in lower   orbit both to do science and to train for longer duration missions and to learn about how to have people survive on long-duration missions and function well ...the only way we're going to be able to do that is if we can have that be commercially successful,"" he added.

U.S. District Court Judge Eric Komitee granted   a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.  It is meant to stop American art collective MSCHF Product Studio from   ""Satan Shoes"" that use Nike Air Max 97 as a base, according to court documents obtained by  . The controversial   were a collaboration with the 21-year-old rapper, which MSCHF and Lil Nas X promoted on Monday, March 29, via  . MSCHF modified the shoes with prints that read ""1/666"" and ""Luke 10:18"" along with a gold pentagram and a liquid-swishing sole that reportedly contains a single drop of human blood. The company quickly sold out of the 666 pairs it made for $1,018 each. Nike filed a four-part complaint against MSCHF on Monday, including trademark infringement, false designation of origin and unfair competition, trademark dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. Lil Nas X is not named a defendant in the lawsuit, according to documents uploaded by  . In a statement sent to Fox News on Thursday, MSCHF asserted the Satan Shoes were created as an artistic commentary much like the holy water-filled Jesus Shoes it debuted in 2019. ""Over a year ago we released the Jesus Shoes. As a manifested speculative artwork Jesus Shoes conflates celebrity collab culture and brand worship with religious worship into a limited edition line of art objects,"" MSCHF’s statement reads. ""Last week’s release of the Satan Shoes, in collaboration with Lil Nas X, was no different. Satan Shoes started a conversation, while also living natively in its space. It is art created for people to observe, speculate on, purchase, and own. Heresy only exists in relation to doctrine: who is Nike to censor one but not the other?"" Lawyers for Nike reportedly argued that MSCHF’s Satan Shoes are damaging to the sneaker giants brand and have caused confusion among customers who believe it is an original Nike creation, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, a lawyer for MSCHF   on Wednesday that opposed Nike’s application for a temporary restraining order. The art collective argues that it made it clear the Satan Shoes were a collaboration with Lil Nas X and not with Nike, according to defense attorney Megan K. Kannigan. ""There is not imminent or immediate threat of irreparable harm related to the Satan Shoes,"" the letter reads before explaining, ""all but one pair of the shoes already have been sold and shipped."" The final shoe was being held for a giveaway but MSCHF is reportedly holding off due to the current litigation. MSCHF will not be producing additional Satan Shoes, the letter explains. Representatives for Lil Nas X and Nike did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment. The release of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes coincide with Lil Nas X’s music video ""Montero (Call Me By Your Name),"" which debuted Friday and shows the rapper dancing with the devil and taking his crown. In an explanation video Lil Nas X provided to  , the young artist said ""Montero"" is partly about his attraction to a man and the dark temptations that are in Hollywood.

When   Trooper Joshua Morris was out in Wilmington last week, he didn’t hesitate to shoot some hoops with local kids who asked him to join some pickup basketball,   reports. One of the youngsters, Ra’kir Allen, acted as the cameraman, commentator and cheerleader for the officer, who played in uniform. ""YAY!"" Allen screamed with glee in a now-viral  , as Morris scored a shot. The nine-year-old hollered, laughed and followed the state trooper’s every move as he showed off his game at the park. ""Oh that's Curry, that’s Curry, that's Curry!"" Allen cheered as the officer made a jump shot, and the two shared a high-five. ""His charisma, his character...I just loved,"" Morris told   of the pure-hearted kid. ""That reeks through his pores. I loved it."" Because Allen kept comparing him to Steph Curry of the NBA, Morris was inspired to treat the boy to a new pair of basketball kicks from the Golden State Warriors player’s Under Armour line. The state trooper got in touch with the fourth grader's mom, Elveria Griffin, to coordinate the sweet surprise, which was also caught on camera. ""My video is going viral because of you, you know that right? You is the man, everybody is talking about how you is the man, the best hype man ever,"" Morris told Allen in the heartwarming video that hit Instagram on Sunday. ""So I wanted to gift you with something. Do you remember what you said when I hit the jump shot and turned around? Curry, right?"" ""Since you was my hype man, I’m going to be your hype man right now,"" Morris said, opening his patrol car and taking out the shoebox. ""A fresh pair of Curry’s!"" Allen’s jaw dropped, and the trooper laughed, directing him to look in the left shoe. ""Is Curry in there?"" the boy joked – and found $50 in cash. ""I appreciate you, man, for you being the best hype man ever,"" Morris said, and Allen gave him a hug.   ""Anytime you see me, it’s all love,"" Morris explained. ""I always got your back, no matter what."" ""When we play on the basketball together that’s a common ground you and I can meet on so we can build these relationships. That breaks that barrier, so we can be friends, so from here we grow, we build a relationship,"" he added. Griffin told WPVI it was ""beautiful"" to see her son’s reaction to the generous gesture from his new friend. Law enforcement should never be strangers in the communities they serve, Morris stressed. Now, he hopes the kicks remind Allen he’s made a forever friend. ""When he laces up those sneakers, he has somebody who believes in him. He has somebody who loves him. He has somebody that will be kind to him,"" he said.

""Screening testing, especially with the over-the-counter tests authorized today, is an important part of the country’s pandemic response—many schools, workplaces, communities, and other entities are setting up testing programs to quickly screen for COVID-19. With the FDA’s authorization of multiple tests, the public can be assured these tests have met our scientific standards for emergency use authorization. As we’ve said all along if it’s a good test, we’ll authorize it,"" said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement.  Both tests require the user to collect a sample via a nasal swab that is then inserted into a test strip. Results take between 10 and 20 minutes.  Abbott said its test would be priced in the ""single digits"" per test and should be available in ""coming weeks"" at pharmacies, supermarkets and other chains. The company can produce about 50 million tests per month. Quidel did not disclose pricing for its test. Both companies said they would sell their tests in two packs. Repeat testing is important to reduce the chances of false results. Both tests can be used by adults to test children 2 years and older. While the move by the FDA is expected to vastly expand the availability of cheap home tests that many experts have advocated since the early days of the outbreak, the announcement came as U.S. testing numbers continue to slide, even as the number of new coronavirus infections is rising again. Still, frequent self-testing is considered key to help reopen schools, universities and offices as vaccinations ramp up. Dr. Michael Mina of Harvard said the expanded testing options would be critical as new virus variants spread and researchers study how long protection from vaccines lasts. ""Vaccines are incredibly important but they are not the end-all, be-all to this pandemic,"" Mina said. ""We need other tools in our arsenal and the widespread availability and rapid scale-up of tests for people to use in the privacy of their homes is going to be an extraordinary gain."" Last month, the FDA eased its standards for reviewing rapid screening tests, after months of criticism from Mina and other experts that they were delaying the introduction of increased testing.",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//health/fda-approves-2-rapid-coronavirus-tests-over-the-counter-at-home-use
35,Tucker investigates: Do highly-processed and sugary foods cause tobacco-like addiction?,"In the latest episode of Fox Nation's "" ,"" host Tucker Carlson and food and health journalist Michael Moss discuss whether highly-processed and overly sugared foods affect free will in the way vices like alcohol and nicotine do. Carlson recounted an experience in a supermarket several years ago, soon after he had completely given up consuming alcoholic beverages. ""There's a physical compenent to this,"" he said. ""I'd never felt it until I quit drinking 20 years ago and I was walking through a grocery store ... and saw a display of donuts -- and I've never been a big donut eater -- and my mouth started watering involuntarily,"" he said. ""And, I thought: 'this is the weirdest thing that's ever happened.'"" Carlson added that with such popular confections, the human brain must then view the starch and sugar as a replacement for the same qualities it found in alcohol. ""I remember thinking that there's soething about this experience that's challenging my view of free will,"" he said. In response, Moss agreed, obliquely comparing Oreos with heroin: ""Where's the ability to say no? These products by design or intent deprive us of free will.""

There was no increased risk for prostate cancer, but breast cancer patients who smoke, or used to smoke, saw a higher risk.  Scientists from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), and other institutes,  findings in the Clinical Nutrition journal. Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses. The questionnaire assessed how often participants consumed ultra-processed foods and drinks over a one-year period. The team then used the Nova classification system, which divides foods into four categories, from unprocessed foods to processed ingredients, and beyond to processed foods and ultra-processed foods and drinks. Examples of ultra-processed products would include ""sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods,"" a related   from ISGlobal notes. ""Ultra-processed foods — those that undergo the most processing — are industrial formulations with more than five ingredients which usually contain additional substances, such as sugar, fats, salt and additives,"" reads the release. The team ultimately found that a ""10% increment in the consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks was found to be associated with an 11% increase in the risk of developing colorectal cancer."" Study author and ISGlobal researcher Dora Romaguera said diets low in fruits and vegetables are missing out on protective benefits against colorectal cancer and suggested the heightened cancer risk is fueled by ""additives and other substances with carcinogenic potential typically used in processed food products."" Common ultra-processed foods consumed by participants included sugary drinks, sugary products, ready meals and processed meats. For breast cancer patients with a history of smoking, or who currently smoke, Romaguera says smoking and a diet high in ultra-processed foods compound to increase the risk of developing cancer. Given the health risks associated with these sugary, processed foods and drinks, Pilar Amiano, a researcher at the Guipúzcoa Public Health Service, said the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( ) should already incorporate the findings into policies and dissuade consumption of these foods.",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//health/ultra-processed-foods-drinks-linked-higher-colorectal-cancer-risk-study

""There’s not a lot of options – only 1% make it in the National Football League, the NBA and so on – but when you have these people with these types of skills, I have an eye for that. I have an eye for people who have the will but don’t have the opportunity, people who have the skills but not the right platform,"" Lewis told Fox News in a recent interview. ""So, from a leadership side, it’s like me coming in giving all the motivation I’ve been given for years and empowering people to succeed.""

""That’s where I think me working with Randy Couture will be really exciting because it's combining our skills and life experiences."" Since its debut in 2018, the PFL has been a rising star on the MMA stage. Unlike the UFC, which features a handful of fights during each event, including preliminary bouts, the main card and a marquee fight usually for a title – the PFL operates much more like an NFL season would. ""It's a format built on meritocracy that works for every major athlete from the NFL to the NBA,"" Murray said. ""Fighters win to advance, those who lose go home. There is a regular season, a playoff and a championship."" The playoff-style format and the chance for the best athletes to advance and earn the million-dollar championship prize are what really drew Lewis to the PFL. ""The format is way better than what the MMA gives us right now. I just love that you have this real avenue to be successful – they want the same thing any NFL player wants. They want chances to be noticed, to go against top people in the business and make some good money,"" Lewis said. In just a few years since its first season, the PFL has already 25% of the audience of the UFC, according to  . ""What’s driving that success is a couple of factors – there's an underserved fan base of 550 million fans around the world, 80% of those fans are outside the U.S., 20% in the U.S.,"" Murray said. ""It is the youngest fan base of all major sports and half of this overall fan base they're not watching stick and ball sports, they want access to more premium quality MMA and the PFL delivers that."" Murray added that the PFL format provides another layer of success, being easy to follow with great narratives and big stars. ""With our sports season format, it’s actually complimentary to the UFC.

The PFL opted to cancel its 2020 season due to COVID concerns, but Murray expects a strong bounce back from all the ""pent-up excitement"" when the fighters make their 2021 season debut on ESPN on April 23. ""The playoff-style brings different energy around it.

52,American Airlines offering 'quarantine free' travel between NYC and Italy," is offering   travel"" on certain flights from New York City to Italy in a bid to boost international travel and recoup revenue lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Soon, passengers who test negative for the virus will be able to travel from flights marketed and operated by American Airlines from New York City's John F. Kennedy airport to Milan and Rome without having to quarantine, the airline announced Thursday.  The major U.S. carrier fell short of specifying when this will occur but indicated it would be within the ""coming days and weeks.""  Prior to travel, customers will still need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Upon arriving in Italy, passengers will have to test negative again. The double testing will effectively allow those to ""forgo the local post-travel quarantine requirements, enabling customers to maximize their time while in Italy,"" the carrier said.  American plans to resume service to Milan starting April 4 and limited service to Rome on May 8 after being suspended for a year. After the onset of the pandemic prompted worldwide lockdowns, air travel was forced to a near standstill.  Industry officials say it was a ""catastrophe"" for the once-lucrative industry and ""there is no other way to describe it."" ""What recovery there was over the Northern hemisphere summer season stalled in autumn and the situation turned dramatically worse over the year-end holiday season, as more severe travel restrictions were imposed in the face of new outbreaks and new strains of COVID-19,"" International Air Transport Association CEO Alexandre de Juniac said in February. Global passenger traffic demand in 2020 fell by 65.9% compared to the full year of 2019, which the IATA says is ""by far the sharpest traffic decline in aviation history."" However, now that vaccines are being rolled out, the airline industry hopes to see the lifting of broad restrictions on travel between the United States and Europe, China and other regions that former President Donald Trump imposed last spring to curb the spread of the virus.  Meanwhile, U.S. air travel is already picking up. The number of passengers screened at U.S. airports has surpassed 1 million for 19 days in a row as of Monday, according to Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  . This marks the most prolonged   rebound amid the pandemic.  To help, American has also upped its in-person pre-flight testing options for travelers across the country including at the airline’s hubs in Charlotte, North Carolina and New York City.  Customers now have access to testing at more than 150 local urgent care facilities or hospitals through GoHealth Urgent Care, the airline said. ",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//travel/american-airlines-offering-quarantine-free-travel-between-ny-and-italy
53,Matthews scores 24th goal as Leafs earn 3-1 win over Jets,"Auston Matthews scored his league-leading 24th goal and goaltender Jack Campbell stayed unbeaten this season and the   downed the   3-1 on Wednesday to extend their lead atop the North Division to three points. Adding to the Jets woes, captain Blake Wheeler did not play after the first period. There was no immediate word on a reason for his absence. ""We’ll get it looked at (Thursday). ... He just wasn’t feeling it right so we want to be careful with him,"" Jets coach Paul Maurice said. ""Truly I don’t know. He may be back on the ice full-on next game,"" he added. ""It’s not COVID-related."" The teams meet again Friday at Bell MTS Place as Toronto continues its four-game road trip. Zach Hyman and Alex Kerfoot also scored for Toronto. Mitch Marner, with two assists, earned his13th multi-point game of the season. ""I don’t know what the numbers are, but I’d imagine if you go up 2-0 in a game you’re going to win most of the time. It’s hard to come back in this league, especially that early,"" Kerfoot said. ""It’s nice to have that cushion."" Josh Morrissey scored for the Jets. The Leafs went 0-for-5 on the power play, extending a drought that goes back to March 9. But they did score short-handed. Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe opted to pass on the power-play deficiencies, choosing instead to see the positives. ""It’s a big road win here for us. There’s a lot of things you could pick out about it that we could do better,"" he said. ""We’ll certainly get to work on that (Thursday). But just focus on the fact that we had a really good start here to set us up for a chance to win the game and we did exactly that."" Winnipeg, back home after a seven-game road trip, had won four of its previous five, including a 5-1 win Monday in Calgary. But it trailed 2-0 after a sluggish first period that saw Toronto dominate despite going 0-for-3 on the power play. ""I was worried about this one right from the day the schedule came out,"" Maurice said. The Leafs were coming off a 3-2 overtime loss to visiting Edmonton on Monday. Toronto had won its previous three outings, including two in overtime, rebounding from a poor stretch that saw it lose six of seven. With No. 1 goalie Frederik Andersen back in Toronto awaiting further injury evaluation of a lower-body injury, Campbell started for the fourth time in the past five games. Campbell, who missed the Edmonton game Monday with a lower-body injury, made 26 saves for the win. He improved to 7-0-0 on the season. It was career game No. 299 as a Jet for goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who stopped 23 shots. Only Ondrej Pavelec (379) has played 300-plus games for the franchise. Matthews opened the scoring at 4:40 to punctuate a sharp Leafs opening. Hyman drove to the net and Winnipeg’s Pierre Luc-Dubois and Derek Forbort ran into each other, leaving Matthews to score from close range. Forbort, in pain after the collision, briefly went to the Jets dressing room. Matthews has scored the opening goal of the game six times this season. Marner, with an assist on Matthews’ goal, ran his points streak against the Jets to five games this season, the first Leaf to have a five-game point streak against Winnipeg. Hyman made it 2-0 at 10:47, poking the puck in from in-close after Matthews hit the post following a nice move by Marner as the Leafs top line swarmed the Winnipeg net. The Jets unsuccessfully challenged for goalie interference on Hyman. Toronto held a 13-2 edge in shots before Winnipeg closed the margin to 14-6 at the end of the first. Hyman had six shots alone in the period. The Jets had more life in the second, outshooting Toronto 16-7 in the period. But despite three straight Toronto penalties, they had to settle for exchanging goals with the Leafs. Paul Stastny appeared to lose a tooth after taking T.J. Brodie's stick to the mouth late in the period. Kerfoot scored short-handed on the ensuing double-minor penalty, outpacing Morrissey after the puck got out of the Toronto zone. Morrissey redeemed himself by scoring on the same power play, his shot beating Campbell through traffic at 17:15, with 6 seconds remaining in the first of Brodie’s two minors. Toronto played a controlled third period to preserve the win. NOTES: The Leafs were the last team in the North Division to visit Winnipeg this season. The teams split the first four meetings in Toronto. ... After playing 12 of 14 games on the road, the Jets play 10 of the next 15 at home starting Monday. The teams play again Friday night.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/matthews-scores-24th-goal-as-leafs-earn-3-1-win-over-jets

Judge struck out in the ninth inning with D.J. LeMahieu on base and he grounded into a double play with the bases loaded in the seventh inning. The slugger finished the game 1-for-5 with a single and two strikeouts. New York lost the game 3-2 and the Yankees were 0-for-9 with runners in scoring position. The outfielder acknowledged he needed to do better in big moments. ""I let the team down twice there and even the ball over my head,"" he   in the 10th inning that allowed the game-winning run. ""That’s another opportunity we could’ve at least held them or at least caught that or cut the guy off to keep him from scoring. Lot of missed opportunities from my part."" Judge had been the focal point of concern throughout spring training. Anonymous scouts were concerned over Judge’s swing specifically. ""Judge goes to some hitting guru in the winter and to me his swing has gotten longer,"" one scout told   in March. ""He needs to go back and talk to Dave Winfield like he did in 2017 when he got to the big leagues."" Another scout added: ""That swing was really long. Judge has to get back to driving the ball into the right-center gap, which is when he’s going good."" Judge can still pack a big punch with the bat, which was proven with a long home run in spring training. But he’s not hit anywhere close to the 52 home runs he had during his rookie season in 2017.

Last week, Tina ordered from the drive-thru of a Houston restaurant, telling   she annunciated her name while wearing a face mask. The customer claims an employee, with whom she spoke face-to-face, jotted down her name in the chain’s iPad ordering system, and that she scanned her Chick-fil-A app, which also lists her name, while placing the order. However, when she was handed the bill, she was shocked to find they wrote ""China"" instead. Tina added that she’s ordered from this Houston Chick-fil-A dozens of times before, too. Contacting the chain, she received the following response via email from the restaurant’s general manager the next day, per Business Insider: ""We want our customers to have a great experience, but it sounds like that didn't happen this time. We know we can't undo what happened, but we'd love another chance to get it right,"" the manager wrote. ""I spoke with my team members from that shift and they informed me that they misheard 'Tina' as 'China' and that it had nothing to do with your ethnicity."" Tina was reportedly offered a free meal as well, but claimed she didn't care ""about free stuff,"" and would have been satisfied if the restaurant pledged to ""offer more training and reassure that they'll do more."" A supervisor for Chick-fil-A reached out with another apology, claiming that they chain's ""young"" employees did not necessarily realize how hurtful their mistakes can be.

58,"Barzal has 3 goals, 2 assists as Islanders beat Capitals 8-4","Mathew Barzal had three goals and two assists, Jordan Eberle scored twice, and the   beat the   8-4 Thursday night. Brock Nelson, Casey Cizikas and Josh Bailey also scored to help the Islanders improve to 14-1-2 at home and move back into a tie with Washington and Pittsburgh atop the East Division with 50 points. The Capitals have a game in hand on both the Islanders and Penguins. ""These games are fun because you’ve got two intense teams,'' Islanders coach Barry Trotz said. ""Fortunately we were able to score some goals tonight."" Semyon Varlamov made 22 saves for New York, improving to 8-3-1 in his last 12 decisions while allowing only 30 goals over that span. Varlamov is 15-7-3 overall this season. John Carlson had two goals, and T.J. Oshie and Daniel Sprong also scored for the Capitals. ""I don’t think we played hard enough to win a hockey game tonight,'' Capitals coach Peter Laviolette said. ""Certain situational things I don't think we did a very good job on. We just lost a game and gave up eight goals. You look to fix that and be better tomorrow night."" The game featured a chaotic first period, beginning during the initial minute when Washington’s starting goaltender Ilya Samsonov had to leave the ice just 30 seconds in after Oshie collided with him behind the net. Oshie’s shoulder made contact with Samsonov’s head, and the goalie skated off for precautionary reasons. Vitek Vanacek temporarily took over in the crease. ""He had to go and get checked out. He was cleared,'' Laviolette added in reference to Samsonov returning to action. ""it was his game so he was going back in."" Carlson quickly opened the scoring at 1:01, blasting Washington’s first shot past Varlamov with assists credited to Tom Wilson and Conor Sheary. Eberle tied it at 5:02, taking a cross-ice pass from Leo Komarov and rifling the puck past Vanacek. The fleet Barzal then put the Islanders ahead 2-1 with a spectacular end-to-end rush, skating through the entire Capitals on-ice quintet and finishing off the solo effort at 16:09 with a high shot past Vanacek while somehow balancing on his right skate blade. ""I knew I had I had picked it up deep and had a little bit of a step,'' the 23-year-old Barzal said. ""I felt like I had some ice that I took advantage of."" Samsonov returned with just over three minutes remaining in the period, just before Nelson scored his 13th goal at 17:32 to make it 3-1. Sprong narrowed the deficit 48 seconds later before Barzal scored again at 18:53 by sliding the puck past Samsonov from a near-impossible angle below the left faceoff circle to make it 4-2 before the first intermission. The Islanders outshot the Capitals 13-7 in the six-goal first period and had a 9-7 shots advantage in the second when the scoring continued as Cizikas made it 5-2 with his seventh goal at 3:03 before Oshie closed the deficit with a power-play goal at 6:47. Eberle then added his second goal of the night at 8:08, one-timing a pass from Barzal for his 13th before Carlson added his second of the game and ninth of the season at 19:01 of the middle period. For the Islander squad that prides itself on winning tight low-scoring games, the rare romp was a relief. ""The importance of this game was huge after dropping two to Pittsburgh. We knew we needed to win,'' Eberle said. ""When you’re scoring, it makes the game fun ... It's nice to know we can put the puck in the net. All in all, it’s two points and that’s what we needed."" Bailey scored at 3:13 of third to make it 7-4 before Barzal completed his fourth career hat trick at 18:54, swatting a puck out of the air past Samsonov as the Islanders set a season high in goals. Barzal’s five-point performance gave him a team-best 33 points through 37 games. He is tied with Eberle and Nelson for the team lead with 13 goals. ""I think aside from my three, we were just playing good hockey all night'' Barzal added. ""I think we could have had two or three more."" The Capitals had won the first three meetings this season at home, outscoring the Islanders 12-6 in that trio of victories. The teams will meet three more times on Long Island and once in Washington. Washington had won 10 of last 12 games entering the contest with the only two defeats coming against the Rangers during that span. The Islanders were 11-4-0 in March, matching the 1981-82 Stanley Cup winning squad for the most wins in March. Since becoming the coach of the Islanders before the 2018-19 season, Trotz is 5-7-0 in the regular season against the team he led to the Stanley Cup in 2018.

Ross Colton and Point scored 1:06 apart in the third period to erase a one-goal deficit and snap a three-game losing streak for the Lightning. ""We’ve played a lot of hockey and pucks have not been going in as easily,’’ Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. ""It’s games like this when you’re battling back and down one with six (minutes) to go ... you just have to keep working to come out of these.’’ Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 36 saves to pick up the win. Eric Robinson and Zach Werenski scored for Columbus, which has one win in the past six games. Elvis Merzlikins finished with 31 saves for the Blue Jackets. ""I thought 99 percent of this hockey club played their (butts) off tonight,’’ Columbus coach John Tortorella said. ""I’m frustrated for the guys because I think they’ve really concentrated on how we’re trying to play right now. To get belief you need results and just to get nothing tonight ... it’s a tough one to eat.’’ Point scored the winner and his second of the game coming in on a 2-on-1 rush and as he tried to backhand a pass over to Tyler Johnson, the puck ramped off the stick of Columbus defenseman David Savard and into the net at 15:54. ""I felt like I had some jump tonight, I think our team had some jump and when we’re skating that’s when we’re creating chances,’’ Point said. ""When Columbus goes up they do a good job of shutting it down.’’ Colton tied the game 66 seconds earlier with a wrist shot from the middle of the left circle. ""I had passed up on a shot like that earlier in the game when I tried to cut to the middle,’’ Colton said. ""So that time I just wanted to get the puck on net and I was lucky that it went in."" The goal answered Robinson’s breakaway conversion at 10:54 that put Columbus in front for the first time in the game. ""It felt really good at the time,’’ Robinson said. Tampa Bay took the lead when Columbus was whistled for too many men on the ice while on the penalty kill to give the Lightning 62 seconds of a two-man advantage. Point cashed in with 15 seconds remaining on the 5-on-3 chance with a shot from the bottom of the left circle that powered its way through Merzlikins at 15:45. The Blue Jackets pushed back in the second period and found the equalizer as Werenski cut across the top of the crease to swat in a rebound off his backhand for the defenseman’s fifth of the season at 9:04 of the second period. ""We played good ... found a way to lose,’’ Werenski said. ""It’s tough right now. It’s one of those things where I thought it was one of our better hockey games and we find a way to lose again. Right now we need results.’’ Tampa Bay D Ryan McDonagh returned to the lineup after missing the previous four games with an undisclosed lower-body injury, but the Lightning remain thin on defense. Erik Cernak missed his fourth consecutive game since taking a puck off the inside of his knee on March 22 in Dallas while Jan Rutta was placed on injured reserve after leaving Tuesday’s game against Columbus with a lower-body injury. Tampa Bay called up D Ben Thomas from the Syracuse Crunch and assigned him to the taxi squad. While Columbus G Joonas Korpisalo returned to the lineup after missing three games with a lower body injury, he dressed as the backup to Elvis Merzlikins, who made his fourth consecutive start, his longest stretch this season.

60,Fiala's shootout goal gives Minnesota wild win in Vegas,"Kevin Fiala scored in the shootout and the   beat the   3-2 on Thursday night. The victory snapped Minnesota’s five-game road losing streak. ""We’ve been playing so well at home, it hasn’t translated on the road,"" said Wild goaltender Cam Talbot, who played his best road game of the season, stopping 35 shots. ""Every game is a four-point game this year. Every game is a big game, and when you come into a building like this, you know you’re going to have to go through this team to make it out of our division for the playoffs. This is a tough building to play in and this gives us confidence moving forward."" Talbot, who is a perfect 7-0-0 at home and improved to 3-5-2 away from St. Paul, is now 6-1-1 with a 1.72 goals-against average and a .948 save percentage in his last eight starts. He leads NHL goalies in saves and shots against, and is tied for second in wins since March 1. Kirill Kaprizov and Jared Spurgeon scored for Minnesota. Fiala was the only skater to score in the shootout, as he banked his shot off the post and then off Vegas goaltender Robin Lehner. ""He’s a big goalie so I didn’t know what to do to be honest,"" Fiala said. ""I decided to go low block and got lucky there. Hit the post and off his pad and in. It was lucky but I’ll take it."" William Karlsson and Brayden McNabb scored for the Golden Knights. Lehner had 35 saves but dropped to 3-0-1 with just six goals allowed since his return from a concussion. Vegas couldn’t capitalize early in the overtime during a 4-on-3 power play opportunity, as Talbot turned away three shots on goal. The Wild nearly got a last-second overtime win but Kaprizov’s wrap-around was denied by Lehner. Playing with just 10 forwards on the second of back-to-back nights, missing injured Ryan Reaves and suspended Chandler Stephenson, Vegas appeared to have a little more jump off the opening puck drop than it did one night earlier in a loss to the Los Angeles Kings. It marked the first time Vegas lost consecutive home games since early last season, when it lost three in regulation from Jan. 7-11, 2020, under then-coach Gerard Gallant, and a fourth in overtime, on Feb. 8, after Peter DeBoer took over. ""I thought we handled it well, I thought it was a non-issue,"" DeBoer said of playing with a shortened roster. ""Guys are always looking for a few more minutes every night. It was nice not to have that as an issue. I thought we had a great effort. Just unfortunate we didn’t get the two points."" The one point Vegas did earn moved it into a first-place tie with Colorado, as both are atop the West with 50 points. Karlsson opened the scoring when he grabbed a loose puck and fired it over Talbot’s right shoulder, marking the first time in four games the Golden Knights scored the game’s first goal. It didn’t take long for the top-scoring rookie in the NHL to tie the game, as Kaprizov was able to get position in front of the net in time to redirect Jordan Greenway’s shot past Lehner. It was the Russian forward’s 13th goal of the season. The second period turned into a highlight reel for both goaltenders. Talbot stopped rookie Keegan Kolesar, who had a beautiful look at the top shelf but had his wrist shot robbed. Just seconds later, after a faceoff to his right, Talbot blocked Kolesar’s backhand from the doorstep. Shortly after Lehner turned away Joel Eriksson Ek’s wrist shot from the slot, it was Talbot once again, this time stopping speedy Alex Tuch on a breakaway. McNabb snapped a 66-game scoring drought when he took a pass from William Carrier and lasered a wrist shot from near the top of the right circle through traffic and past Talbot. It was McNabb’s first goal since Nov. 21, 2019, against the San Jose, when DeBoer was still in charge of the Sharks. Minnesota took advantage of a 4-on-3 situation when Spurgeon blasted a one-timer from the left circle to make it a 2-2 game. Minnesota forward Mats Zuccarello played in his 600th career game. Golden Knights defenseman Nic Hague had just six penalty minutes over his first 28 games. He’s been plagued in the sin bin the last four games, accumulating 14 penalty minutes, including four against the Wild. Stephenson served the first of a three-game suspension, handed down by the league’s player safety department for elbowing Los Angeles Kings defenseman Tobias Bjornfot on Wednesday. Stephenson will forfeit $71,120.70, all of which will go to the players' emergency assistance fund.

62,Passengers cruise through Italy's Easter festivities on MSC Grandiosa amid country's coronavirus lockdowns," may be in a strict   lockdown this Easter with travel restricted between regions and new quarantines imposed. But a few miles offshore, guests aboard the MSC Grandiosa   are shimmying to Latin music on deck and sipping cocktails by the pool. In one of the anomalies of   that have shuttered hotels and resorts around the world, the   this winter with seven-night cruises, a lonely flag-bearer of the global cruise industry. After cruise ships were early sources of highly publicized coronavirus outbreaks, the Grandiosa has tried to chart a course through the pandemic with strict anti-virus protocols approved by Italian authorities that seek to create a ""health bubble"" on board. Passengers and crew are tested before and during cruises. Mask mandates, temperature checks, contact-tracing wristbands and frequent cleaning of the ship are all designed to prevent outbreaks. Passengers from outside Italy must arrive with negative COVID-19 tests taken within 48 hours of their departures and only residents of Europe’s Schengen countries plus Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria are permitted to book under COVID-19 insurance policies. On Wednesday, the Grandiosa left the Italian port of Civitavecchia for its weeklong Easter cruise, with 2,000 of its 6,000-passenger capacity and stops planned in Naples and Valletta, Malta, before returning to its home port in Genoa. Passengers welcomed the semblance of normalcy brought on by the freedom to eat in a restaurant or sit poolside without a mask, even if the virus is still a present concern. ""After a year of restrictive measures, we thought we could take a break for a week and relax,"" said Stefania Battistoni, a 39-year-old teacher and single mother who overnight from Bolzano, in northern Italy, with her two sons and mother to board the cruise. The pandemic has plunged global cruise ship passenger numbers from a record 30 million in 2019 to more than 350,000 since July 2020, according to Cruise Lines International, the world’s largest cruise industry association representing 95% of ocean-going cruise capacity. Currently, fewer than 20 ships are operating globally, a small fraction of CLIA’s members’ fleets of 270 ships. The United States could be among the last cruise ship markets to reopen, possibly not until fall, and not until 2022 in Alaska. Two Royal Caribbean cruise lines that normally sail out of Miami opted instead to launch sailings in June from the Caribbean, where governments are eager to revive their tourism-based economies despite activist concerns about the health and environmental impact. On the MSC, extra cabins are set aside to isolate suspected virus cases. Because of the contact tracing wristbands, if a passenger tests positive, medical personnel can identify anyone with whom they were in contact. Once the situation is clear, anyone who is positive is transferred to the shore. According to an independent consulting firm, Bermello Ajamii & Partners, just 23 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed on ships since the industry began its tentative relaunch last summer, for a passenger infection rate of 0.006%. But cruise industry critics say the risk isn’t worth it and add that cruise companies should have taken the pandemic timeout to address the industry’s long-standing environmental and labor problems. ""All large cruise ships burn huge volumes of the dirtiest, cheapest fuel available,"" said Jim Ace of environmental group Stand Earth, a member of the Global Cruise Activist Network. ""Cruise ship companies could have used the COVID shutdown to address their impacts on public health and the environment. Instead, they scrapped a few of their oldest ships and raised cash to stay alive."" On board, though, passengers are relishing the chance to enjoy activities that have been mostly closed in Italy and much of Europe for a year: a theater, restaurant dining, duty-free shopping and live music in bars. The rest of Italy is heading back into full lockdown over the Easter weekend, with shops closed and restaurants and bars open for takeout only to try to minimize holiday outbreaks. In addition, Italy’s government imposed a five-day quarantine on people entering from other EU countries in a bid to deter Easter getaways. ""Let’s say that after such a long time of restrictions and closures, this was a choice done for our mental health,"" said Federico Marzocchi, who joined the cruise with his wife and 10-year-old son Matteo. The European cruise industry is looking to expand the reopening this spring. Cruises are circulating on Spain’s Canary islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa, including the company AIDA catering to German tourists. Costa Cruises, which with MSC is one of Europe’s largest cruise companies, will resume cruises on May 1, with seven-night Italy-only cruises. Costa plans to begin sailing in the western Mediterranean from mid-June. Britain is opening to cruise ships in May, with MSC and Viking launching cruises of the British Isles, among several companies offering at-sea ""staycation"" cruises aimed at capturing one of the most important cruise markets. The cruise industry is hoping Greece will open in mid-May, but the country hasn’t yet announced when it will reopen tourism. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a ""framework"" for resuming cruises in the U.S., but the industry says the health agency hasn’t spelled out the details that companies need to operate their ships. Once the CDC provides technical requirements, industry officials say it takes about 90 days to prepare a ship for sailing. The cruise companies complain that last fall’s CDC framework is outdated and should be scrapped. They say it was issued before vaccines were available and before the restart of cruises in Europe, which they say have safely carried thousands of passengers under new COVID-19 protocols. And they complain that cruising is the only part of the U.S. economy that remains shuttered by the pandemic. The Cruise Lines International Association trade group is lobbying for an early July start to U.S. cruising, noting that loyal cruise customers will just go to elsewhere. ""Cruisers love to cruise, and they will go where the ships are sailing,"" said Laziza Lambert, a spokeswoman for the trade group. Still, environmentalists pushing back against an earlier restart say the timeout imposed by COVID-19 provides a window to address the industry’s issues. ""Large cruise ships pollute our air, our water, and contribute to climate change. They are toxic to port communities. And they spread COVID. They exploit workers and put passengers at risk,″ said Jim Ace, a Washington state-based campaigner who is part of the Global Cruise Activist Network. ""Why should large cruise ships be allowed to return before they have addressed these concerns?""",Lifestyle,https://www.foxnews.com//lifestyle/italy-takes-the-easter-festivities-to-sea-amid-the-coronavirus-lockdown
63,"Bueckers, McDonald propel UConn and Arizona to Final Four","One is a freshman who stepped into the job of leading the most successful program in women’s basketball. The other is a senior who accepted the call to build one of the worst into one of this season’s best. Together, UConn’s Paige Bueckers and Arizona’s Aari McDonald are two of the most dynamic scorers in the country heading into their Friday night clash in the women’s NCAA Tournament Final Four. UConn won the River Walk region and rides into its 13th consecutive Final Four as Bueckers this week became the first freshman to win The Associated Press national player of the year award. The challenge for Bueckers this season was learning how to lead a program that had already produced some of the game’s greatest players — including Rebecca Lobo, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Breanna Stewart — in the Huskies' charge for a potential 12th national championship. Before the season began, UConn coach Geno Auriemma considered bringing her off the bench just to ease her into the role. Two weeks of watching Bueckers in practice tossed that idea ""out the window,"" he said. Bueckers led the Huskies (28-1) in scoring, assists and steals this season and scored 28 points in their 69-67 regional final win over Baylor. Auriemma this week called Bueckers ""dominant"" in ""the biggest games we played."" But she’s still a freshman playing in her first Final Four at a program where winning it all is the annual demand. UConn hasn’t made it to the championship game since 2016. ""She’s still a young kid who was playing against high school girls last year, so yeah, this is big. Nothing that I say is gonna change the bigness of it,"" Auriemma said. ""I’m sure there’s a part of her that, you know, is anxious, nervous, all the things that you would be if you were her in a game like this ... But somehow, someway, she finds what all great players do. She finds that thing that she has inside of her that very few people have, that allows to her to function in those big moments."" McDonald’s burden was to build a winner at a program stuck in a basketball desert. Coach Adia Barnes put that job on her as soon as McDonald transferred from Washington in 2017 when the Wildcats were living at the bottom of the Pac-12. McDonald sat out the 2017-2018 season and watched at Arizona won just six games. Now she is the conference player of the year and has the Wildcats on level ground with the Huskies for at least one more day. ""It’s crazy. We really started at the bottom,"" McDonald said. ""Coach (Adia) Barnes and the other coaches. They do a great job recruiting. They changed the culture since I’ve been here. My teammates have put in so much work and it’s exciting to see it all pay off."" The Wildcats (20-5) won the Mercado region as a No. 3 seed. McDonald has scored at least 31 points in each of the Wildcats previous two games. Against Indiana in the regional final, she twisted her left ankle with 2:35 left, but limped back on to put the exclamation on the win with a 3-point play. She said the ankle should be fine Friday night. ""Nobody thinks we can win. We’re the underdogs We’re going to play loose and free"" McDonald said. The UConn-Arizona winner advances to Sunday’s final against the winner of Friday’s other semifinal matchup between Stanford and South Carolina. Auriemma and Barnes met in the 1998 women's NCAA Tournament when Barnes the point guard led Arizona to the Sweet 16, in what had been the school’s deepest tourney run. UConn won 74-57, but Auriemma remembers Barnes, who was the conference player of the year that season, as an ""impossible matchup."" ""You couldn’t guard her with a guard, you couldn’t guard her with a forward,"" Auriemma said. ""(Now) she has made women’s basketball at Arizona supremely important. She’s just, I think, a coach for the future who’s having tremendous success in the present."" UConn’s Christyn Williams has the difficult job of defending McDonald, who uses the quick bursts in her 5-foot-6 frame to blow by defenders on drives into the lane or sneak through traffic for wide-open 3-pointers. McDonald made five of six from long range against Indiana. She also grabbed 11 rebounds. ""She’s a great player, very quick, she can get to the basket, she can create space for herself,"" Williams said. ""She’s a handful."" Williams drew a similar assignment in the Sweet 16 and was able to contain Iowa’s Caitlin Clark, the nation’s leading scorer, holding her to 21 points, six below her average. Arizona is the first women's team to make the Final Four after missing the previous 10 NCAA Tournaments. They likely would have made the tournament last season but it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Barnes is the sixth coach to lead their alma mater to the Final Four. She also joins South Carolina’s Dawn Staley in the first time two Black women head coaches have made to the national semifinals.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/bueckers-mcdonald-propel-uconn-and-arizona-to-final-four
64,Tar Heels turn attention to hiring Williams' successor," now faces the challenge of finding Roy Williams’ successor. The Hall of Fame coach is retiring from the Tar Heels’ storied men’s basketball program, opening the job for the first time in nearly two decades. That leaves athletics director Bubba Cunningham directing the highest-profile coaching search of his nearly decade-long tenure at UNC, with Williams set to have at least some input. ""I believe we’ve got the best job in college basketball,"" Cunningham said. ""This job doesn’t come open very often. We need to spend a great deal of time thinking about who is the right person right now."" Williams  , saying he no longer felt like ""the right man"" for the job over the past two difficult seasons. That ends an 18-season run that included three NCAA titles since he returned to his alma mater after a 15-year run at Kansas. In a virtual news conference Thursday night, Cunningham said he and chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz would handle the process instead of using a search firm or committee. He said he has sought input from a numerous former players as well as Williams, who Cunningham said had already shared his opinion. Williams mentioned that, too, during his news conference earlier Thursday. ""I’m putting a lot of load on he and the chancellor’s shoulders because I’m giving my opinion very strongly about what I want to happen with the program,"" Williams said. Cunningham said he prefers head-coaching experience but it isn't required. The same is true of hiring someone with UNC ties, which worked with longtime assistant Bill Guthridge taking over after Dean Smith's 1997 retirement and Williams’ return in 2003 – but didn’t work during the tumultuous tenure of Matt Doherty after Williams turned turned down the job following Guthridge's retirement in 2000. ""The history and tradition here is winning,"" Cunningham said. ""We’ve had it in the family for a long period of time. That is important. But it’s not the only factor in trying to make a decision like this."" Cunningham said there is no specific timetable, though he noted UNC moved quickly in hiring Mack Brown for a second stint as football coach after firing Larry Fedora in a process taking only a few days in November 2018. He mentioned an urgency for a new coach to deal with large numbers of college players pursuing transfers, a list that includes UNC freshman 7-footer Walker Kessler. ""It’s going to be a very different environment in coaching, recruiting and retaining students to play on the team,"" Cunningham said. ""And quite frankly, college basketball is better when North Carolina is good. We need to be good and we’re committed to being good. And now we have to find the right leader that can maintain the standards that we’ve become accustomed to.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/tar-heels-turn-attention-to-hiring-williams-successor
65,Nuggets lead all the way in beating Clippers 101-94,"Jamal Murray scored 23 points and the   led all the way in beating the   101-94 on Thursday night for their fourth straight victory. The Nuggets dominated the first three quarters on a night when Nikola Jokic didn’t reach double figures until hitting a 3-pointer with 5:20 left in the game. He finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. ""We expect 30, 20 and 15 from him every night,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said of Jokic. ""He didn’t play poor but he didn’t play to the level he’s played at in the last 15 games."" Jokic’s supporting cast came through. Michael Porter Jr. added 20 points and Will Barton had 19 points. Aaron Gordon added 14 points as Denver improved to 3-0 since Gordon arrived last week via a trade from Orlando. ""We set the tone and were able to sustain that,"" Murray said. ""We were in control and especially on the road that’s a big deal."" Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 24 points and 12 rebounds. Paul George had 17 points and eight rebounds in his return after missing two games with a sore right foot. Terance Mann added 18 points off the bench. George said the soreness and swelling in his foot is related to the bone edema issue that sidelined him earlier. ""It’s a day-to-day process, but I’m doing better,"" he said. ""Some days it’s more sore than others."" The Clippers made a run in the fourth, opening with a 13-3 spurt that left them trailing 84-83. But Denver outscored them the rest of the way. Jokic’s 3-pointer extended the Nuggets’ lead to six and Murray’s 3 made it 96-88. ""That’s back-to-back games that we’ve led wire-to-wire which is really impressive when you consider who we played, with Philadelphia being a very good team, as are the Clippers,"" Malone said. The Clippers, who lead the NBA in 3-point shooting, were 10 of 34 from long-range. Leonard scored 11 points in the third, when the Clippers trailed by 18 early on. He set up a dunk by Patrick Patterson and a 3-pointer from Mann before Leonard hit just his second 3 of the game. They trailed 81-70 heading into the fourth. Jokic was the only Denver starter not in double figures by halftime. He had four points on 2-of-7 shooting, five rebounds and four assists. The Clippers were out of sorts from the start. They were just 6 of 17 from the floor in the first quarter when Denver led by 13. Their foibles continued in the second. George was out on the break and missed an easy dunk. Nicolas Batum came in to clean up and also missed. Nuggets: Gordon had 13 and six points in his first two games. ... They dished out 28 assists, the 14th straight game they’ve had 25 or more. Clippers: They held Denver to 39 points in the second half after giving up 62 in the first half. ... They got outscored 42-40 in the paint. ... The ball got stuck behind the backboard in the fourth and Batum’s height came in handy in getting it dislodged. Newly acquired Rajon Rondo is injured, but he’s still contributing to the Clippers from the sideline acting as a coach. ""Every time I came back to the bench he’s letting me know something he saw,"" Mann said. ""It’s been really cool. He just knows the game so well."" Nuggets: Host Orlando on Sunday.

66,"Players hear 'a lot of talk' from Emmert about Title IX, NIL","A trio of men's basketball players asked NCAA President Mark Emmert during a video call Thursday to abide by, and enforce, Title IX gender equity rules and to create a waiver that would let college athletes start earning money from use of their names, images and likenesses this year. What did the three students say they heard in return? ""A lot of talk,"" according to Iowa’s Jordan Bohannon. Another player involved, Rutgers’ Geo Baker, said Emmert repeatedly referred to waiting for Congress to intervene and summed up the session this way: ""What it really sounded like was that the NCAA doesn’t really want to be the first to make action."" ""We brought up a lot of our points, and it’s kind of like he would say the same thing and kind of agree with us. But that really wasn’t going anywhere,"" Michigan’s Isaiah Livers said. ""And obviously, from what I hear, he likes to kind of talk about points instead of make action."" Emmert's take: ""We had a really good, really constructive conversation,"" he said during an availability later Thursday, ""and I look forward to continuing to work with them and others."" In coordination with the National College Players Association, the athletes used a social media campaign — with the Twitter hashtag #NotNCAAProperty — during March Madness to protest rules that deny NIL rights and to put a spotlight on differences between the men's and women's basketball tournaments wrapping up this weekend in Indiana and Texas. ""Let this be the last NCAA tournament designed to treat women’s basketball players as inferior to men’s basketball players. Let this be the last NCAA tournament that generates a billion dollars from the talents of predominately black basketball players who aren’t allowed to make one dime off their own name,"" Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association, said on a call with reporters after the three players spoke with Emmert and, in a separate video meeting, Sens. Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal. ""This is why we’re all here today — to call for an end to the economic, racial and sex-based discrimination NCAA sports imposes on college athletes,"" Huma said. Title IX says schools that receive federal funding must provide equal opportunities to men and women. But even if the trio that met with Emmert knows the rules do not specifically apply to NCAA action, they think its principles should be followed by the group that oversees college sports, especially in light of  . ""It wasn’t a mistake. It was almost like it was clearly done that they didn’t want to put as much effort (into) the women’s that they did for the men’s,"" Bohannon said. ""So us requesting that is further hopefully understanding in the future that this situation will never happen again."" In addition to the Title IX and NIL topics, Emmert was asked to give players more of a voice in the process, including in front of the Division I Council and Board of Governors. Huma said miscommunication led to there not being any female athletes present for the video meeting with Emmert, who said: ""We need to do the same thing with women’s athletes, by the way. Obviously, I haven’t talked to any athletes on the women’s side but want to do that as soon as possible."" There were women's basketball players who spoke to the media along with Bohannon, Baker and Livers. They said they were upset about the much-discussed differences between the two basketball tournaments. They also wanted to look forward and make the case for how NIL rights can help college athletes. ""I’m here just because I’m not sure that anything will change by the time I leave here,"" Michigan junior forward Naz Hillmon said, ""but I hope to see some change."" The blanket waiver would permit players to seek NIL endorsement deals as soon as July, before any full action comes on Capitol Hill, where there is legislation pending. And Emmert's response on that? ""Basically he said he’s going to get back to us. There wasn’t a direct answer. That was one of the times where he kept talking about Congress, you know? Needing help from Congress. What can Congress do first?"" Baker said. ""And then he basically said, ‘Well, if Congress doesn’t do anything, then we can discuss the other possibilities, like a blanket waiver.’ Kind of going around the question a little bit, basically just saying he’ll get back to us about it.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/players-hear-a-lot-of-talk-from-emmert-about-title-ix-nil

Controlling owner Dean Spanos is facing a court challenge from his sister Dea Spanos-Berberian to force the sale of the team. Both are co-trustees of the Spanos Family Trust which controls 36% of the Chargers. The four children of late owner Alex Spanos -- Dean, Dea,  Alexandra Spanos Ruhl and Michael Spanos -- each own 15% of the team.  The family trust, which is reportedly in debt, cannot honor its commitments for its charitable contributions. So Spanos- Berberian contends the only way the trust can pay off that debt is by selling its share of the team. ""Dean refuses to consider a sale of the Trust’s Interest of the Chargers, insisting that the Co-Trustees continue to borrow more and more, and to force the charities and beneficiaries to wait for years and to ‘hope’ while Dean speculates further on a football team,"" Spanos-Berberian’s court filing said according to  . Spanos' sister argues that he ""has failed to present any plan to address the Trust’s bleak financial picture because there is no other plan ... His plan is hope."" According to Spanos-Berberian, the debts and expenses are over $353 million. Dean Spanos reportedly agreed to retain an investment bank at the end of the 2024 season to find a new owner for the team, but his sister contends that the debt is so high that the trust can’t wait any longer. After 56 seasons in San Diego, the team has a hard time finding its fan base in Los Angeles. The Chargers began in LA in the old AFL in 1960 and played their one season before moving south. With quarterback   as the face of the franchise for the near future, the Chargers are certainly an attractive team to purchase. The move to Los Angeles is another reason why someone like Jeff Bezos may be interested in buying the team. Forbes recently valued the Chargers at $2.6 billion. Spanos- Berberian says that the team is a ""rare trophy asset"" and says that ""the price a buyer is willing to pay is often not dictated by any economic metric."" Since the NFL recently agreed to a new media rights deal that could be worth more than $10 billion per year, Spanos- Berberian claims that the Chargers ""will certainly attract potential buyers.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/chargers-playing-family-feud-not-football-in-fight-over-sale-of-nfl-team
68,NFL considering changing onside kick and overtime rules,"The NFL is considering a rule change that would allow teams to maintain possession of the ball after a score by substituting one offensive play for an onside kickoff attempt. The proposal submitted by the Philadelphia Eagles is among 11 that will be voted on at the spring league meetings. This one would allow teams to keep the ball by converting a fourth-and-15 from their 25-yard line. Another proposal from the Baltimore Ravens changes the overtime format and eliminates overtime in the preseason. It allows the winner of the overtime coin toss to choose where to spot the ball for the first play or start on offense or defense from the designated spot. According to the proposal, ""regardless of which privilege is chosen by the winner of the toss, privilege (a) is to be exercised before privilege (b), so that the selection of whether to play offense or defense is made after the starting field position is chosen."" Other potential changes include adding a loss of down for a second forward pass from behind the line and for a pass thrown after the ball returns behind the line and to ensure the enforcement of all accepted penalties committed by either team during successive try attempts. A proposal by the Kansas City Chiefs would allow single-digit numbers to be worn by defensive backs, linebackers, running backs, fullbacks, tight ends, H-backs and wide receivers.

69,Iowa's Luka Garza named AP men's college player of the year,"Luka Garza knew what everyone expected before returning for a final run as Iowa’s unquestioned star. Pressure? Garza felt it, all right, enough to know his mental health required the same attention as his game. ""I needed meditation to lean on, to be able to mainly just go out there and be myself and not worry about anything else,"" Garza said. That best explains why the 6-foot-11, 265-pound senior is The Associated Press men’s college basketball national player of the year after finishing second last season. He was the runaway choice for the award announced Thursday, receiving 50 of 63 votes from   voters. Ayo Dosunmu, who led Illinois to the Big Ten Tournament title and a No. 1 NCAA seed, was second with six votes, followed by Oklahoma State freshman Cade Cunningham with three. Gonzaga’s Corey Kispert and Baylor’s Jared Butler each earned two votes. Garza ranked second nationally by averaging 24.1 points with 8.7 rebounds. He improved shooting percentages across the board – including going from 36% on 3-pointers last year to 44% – and his assist-to-turnover ratio after working on passing ahead of double- and triple-teams he knew would come all season long. Garza led the Hawkeyes to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, then accounted for nearly half their points (36 of 80) in a second-round upset loss to Oregon. The native of Washington, D.C., finished as the career scoring leader (2,306) at Iowa, which will retire his No. 55 jersey. ""We may never see another one like him,"" coach Fran McCaffery said. Sure, he had the big numbers and helped the Hawkeyes spend nearly the entire season in the top 10 nationally. But Garza figures the daily ritual of resetting his mind while focusing on something as simple as his breathing led to all of that — particularly in a season altered by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You had to be in your house quarantined, going to the gym, going home,"" Garza said. ""There’s no distraction. If you play a bad game, that’s all you’re thinking about. So you need to be in a healthy mental space or you would just let it eat at you – especially a person like me who thinks as much as I do. ""I needed it to be a daily thing because I faced this anxiety every single day. It definitely became something that helped me out a lot and contributed to my being able to be there and be in the moment every single game and every single day."" Garza was second to Dayton’s Obi Toppin for last year’s award. It was during that season that he began gameday meditation at the suggestion of his father, a former player at Idaho. As Frank Garza put it: ""It’s worth taking the mind to the gym."" ""Every player deals with that performance anxiety and overthinking, so he was not immune to it,"" the elder Garza said. ""But what happened as the stakes got higher, and the performance requirement was higher, the pressure becomes at the same level. And if you’re not dealing with it, that will consume you. That will eat you alive."" As a senior, Garza moved to daily meditation, typically 20 to 25 minutes via Zoom with his father and Frank’s business partner, GuruGanesha Khalsa. Pregame sessions sometimes included some teammates, and Luka also used the Calm meditation-and-sleep phone app. ""I got to a point where I was waking up and I did a meditation every single day throughout the season because it was a daily thing that I was dealing with,"" he said. ""I’d turn on the TV and my name was being talked about. I needed to be able to just focus on what I wanted to accomplish as a team."" Some of that bled into games, too, with Garza practicing breathing exercises before free throws or during timeouts. He's sticking with meditation, too, as he pursues an NBA career. He has all the proof he needs that it can work. ""There's a lot of things in life that you want to happen or want to go better than they are and everything like that,"" he said. ""So it's going to hit somebody at some point, and it's just a very useful tool for really anybody.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/iowas-luka-garza-named-ap-mens-college-player-of-the-year

72,ETSU players allege men's basketball coach's resignation was due to protest support; AD denies,"The   (ETSU) men’s basketball team was embroiled in controversy during the season when players knelt for the national anthem. The move sparked a fervent reaction that went all the way to the Tennessee Statehouse. Coach Jason Shay resigned earlier this week and players who were on his team have spoken out about his departure, alleging the university forced him out over the kneeling protest during the season. ""I personally feel like him resigning is crazy,"" Buccaneers guard Truth Harris told   on Thursday. ""It shows a lot of what is going on in this town, and in this country right now."" Another Buccaneers guard Jordan Coffin added: ""All this about us kneeling, and then Coach Shay supporting us through all of that. People should want a coach that stands behind the players through anything. For that to be a part of why he has to resign, then I don't want no part of that."" Shay was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall award, which is given to the top first-year Division I Basketball Coach but lost to UC Riverside’s Mike Magpayo. Shay said in a statement it was in the ""best interest"" of himself, the family and the program to resign. ""This past year has been extremely challenging for me in many different ways,"" he said. ""It is the right time for a new challenge and an opportunity to reset my personal and professional goals."" East Tennessee State athletic director Scott Carter denied Shay was forced to step down. ""I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the speculation that appears in the news and on social media. ETSU did not fire Coach Shay nor force Coach Shay to resign. As outlined in the terms of the separation agreement, in Coach Shay’s statement and in my previous statement, Coach Shay decided to resign,"" Carter said. Carter added that Shay will receiver $450,000 per the parties’ separation agreement, according to  . Shay supported the team’s national anthem protest during the season. In February, Tennessee Republicans put ETSU and other Tennessee schools on notice after the team knelt. ""The National Anthem is a symbol of pride for America,"" a letter to the schools read. ""It lifts our spirits toward the ideals upon which our great country was founded: that all are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" The senators added: ""During athletic competitions, our student athletes represent not only themselves, but also our universities and all the citizens of this state, many of whom view this form of protest as offensive and disrespectful to the very thing our National Anthem represents. While we recognize our student athletes may express their own views on a variety of issues in their personal time, we do not condone any form of protest that could be viewed as disrespectful to our nation or flag while they are representing our state universities. ""When they don the jersey of a Tennessee university, they step out of their personal roles and into the role of an ambassador for our state. We expect all those who walk onto the field of play representing our universities to also walk onto the field of play to show respect for our National Anthem."" The lawmakers urged school officials to implement rules against kneeling during the anthem.",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/etsu-players-mens-basketball-coach-resignation-protest-support-ad-denies

""I've never been a part of a game where a team basically had the same shooting numbers on free throws and on threes,"" Brooks said. ""We were 6 for 19 from the line and 5 for 19 on threes. You've got to step up and make free throws."" The Pistons shot 49% percent in the first half and held the Wizards to 20% on 3-pointers to take a 63-44 halftime lead. Detroit also went 10 for 10 from the free-throw line while Washington missed all five of their attempts. ""We let a hungry player take shootaround shots all night,"" Brooks said.

""I think it will be awesome, just for him coming back,"" he continued. ""Fans, the team, everyone will get to give him his due. Whether it’s a video, anything they do, I think it will be just a great atmosphere in the locker room for people to just give him a huge thank you. Because he’s been awesome.

78,"At last, Oladipo finally gets his chance to play with Heat","Victor Oladipo got swept out of the first round of the playoffs last season by  , and when that series concluded he had no doubt the Heat would end up in the NBA Finals. He was right. And now, he’s got a chance to help them make this season’s playoff push. Oladipo has been an offseason Miami resident, and now, he’s finally an in-season one as well. He started in his Heat debut Thursday night, helping Miami get over the .500 mark with a 116-109 win over the Golden State Warriors. ""He’s a veteran guy, he’s played in good programs on good teams, so he knows how to fit in,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""I think defensively, it’s extremely natural, the fit. And offensively, he gives us that downhill attack, another guy that can make plays, another guy that can put pressure on opposing defenses in the paint."" It’s a fit that has been a long time coming. Oladipo is close with Miami legend Dwayne Wade — Oladipo played at Indiana for Tom Crean, Wade’s coach at Marquette — and that’s just one of many hints that this pairing was inevitable. Oladipo trains in Miami, his name somehow always seems to get linked to the Heat in trade or free-agent talks, and above all else he sees himself as a fit for the Heat. The buzzword they use in Miami is ""culture."" Spoelstra often says it’s not for everybody. Oladipo has craved being a part of it. ""I come from high-cultural basketball: DeMatha Catholic High School, to Indiana University, and now being on the Heat,"" Oladipo said. ""It’s a culture. It’s a way of life and it’s playing for something bigger than yourself. It’s sacrifice, it’s winning at the ultimate level. That’s what I’m used to. That’s what I flourish in. ""I feel like being a part of this and walking around that locker room every day and seeing those championships, and walking around and seeing what winning looks like, it’s going to help me be a better player, be a better person, and help me help this team win at the highest level."" That, and he’s already had a taste of that culture from the workouts he used to share with Wade. The three-time NBA champion with the Heat thought nothing of sharing secrets and advice with Oladipo, who soaked up every word. Oladipo came to Miami at the trade deadline last week, the Heat adding him — a two-time All-Star, a 21-point-per-game scorer this season and someone only three years removed from All-NBA status — from Houston in exchange for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick swap in 2022. ""It gives them another presence defensively, gives them another scoring option,"" Golden State guard Stephen Curry said. ""It’s a good pickup for a good team. Obviously, they’re the defending Eastern Conference champs and they got better and I’m sure he’ll enjoy his time here playing with the guys he gets to play with."" Oladipo didn’t enjoy playing against them last year, when he and the Indiana Pacers endured that first-round sweep. But even then, he knew the potential. And now that he’s in Miami, he’s eager to see if another deep Heat postseason run can happen. ""I felt how they clicked, what they were doing out there, I felt it,"" Oladipo said. ""I felt something special there. So, to be a part of this group now, it’s truly a blessing.""",Sports,https://www.foxnews.com//sports/at-last-oladipo-finally-gets-his-chance-to-play-with-heat
79,"Biden uses ESPN to slam Georgia voting law, wants All-Star Game moved","Barack Obama went on ESPN to unveil his March Madness brackets. Donald Trump regularly attacked NFL players for their anthem protests. And now Joe Biden is taking a swing at it. In an interview on ESPN’s ""Sports Center,"" Biden made news by backing efforts to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta as a protest against Georgia’s new voting law. It’s striking that co-host Sage Steele chose to ask about the controversial law, which Biden described as ""Jim Crow on steroids."" In the past, ESPN has drawn flak for being too political and too liberal, particularly when it came to Trump. Former host Jemele Hill caused an uproar when she attacked the former president as a white supremacist. But there is an effort by the baseball players’ union to use the All-Star Game to punish Georgia, whose restrictions on voting and ID requirements for mail ballots were signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. So Steele may have had little choice but to raise a controversy in which politics and sports had already melded. While Trump, a onetime USFL team owner, was often at odds with pro athletes—some of whom refused to make the traditional White House visit when they won a championship—Biden is eager to side with the players. ""I think today’s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" he told the network. ""People look to them. They’re leaders."" There is some precedent, as the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of Charlotte in 2017 to protest a North Carolina law limiting anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. In setting up another question for the president, Steele noted that Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has repealed his state’s mask mandate. He asked about the decision by the Texas Rangers to allow its stadium to be filled to capacity for its home opener Monday—more than 40,000 people--although masks would be required except when eating. ""That’s a decision they made,"" said Biden. ""I think it’s a mistake. They should listen to Dr. Fauci and the scientists and the experts, but I think it’s not responsible."" Most baseball franchises are limiting attendance. In the latest sign that MLB isn’t any more immune from this virus this season than the last one, yesterday’s Washington Nationals game against the New York Mets was postponed after five people in the Nats organization tested positive for Covid. Trump made his attacks on pro football players into part of the culture wars. In one tweet four years ago, he pulled a page from ""The Apprentice"": ""If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!"" Another time, the 45th president wrote: ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He's fired. He's fired.’"" Trump also told Mike Pence to leave an Indianapolis Colts game if a number of players took a knee, which the vice president did. And Trump taunted the league when the ratings declined. Also in 2017, Trump withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors after Steph Curry and others criticized him. The team visited Obama instead. It’s hardly shocking that Biden, a self-proclaimed ""union guy,"" would back the baseball players’ union. The All-Star controversy was also a slow pitch over the plate for him, given his repeated denunciations of the Georgia voting law. But Biden is unlikely to insert himself into numerous sports controversies. Meanwhile, Georgia politicians are also taking a baseball bat to major corporations. After Delta’s CEO slammed the voting law as ""unacceptable,"" the state House passed a bill repealing the airline’s tax break on jet fuel.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-uses-espn-to-slam-georgia-voting-law-wants-all-star-game-moved
80,"22 states fight California gun restrictions, urge Ninth Circuit to rule against large-capacity magazine ban",": A coalition of 22 states, led by the Republican attorneys general of Arizona and Louisiana, is urging the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to   California’s controversial attempt to ban high-capacity magazines, after the court agreed to reconsider its decision to rule it unconstitutional. ""California politicians are at it again, convinced that their agendas should override the Constitutional rights of the people,"" said Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, in a statement, announcing the filing of an amicus brief. ""Attempts to undermine the Second Amendment or any of our civil rights and liberties should be met with deep skepticism and vigorous opposition."" California passed a ban on magazines of 10 bullets or more in 2016. A ruling by a federal judge that it was unconstitutional was upheld by a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit last year. In February, the court agreed to have an 11-judge panel rehear the case. ""Large-capacity magazines have been used in many horrific mass shootings around the country, including right here in California,"" said then-California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, in February. ""That’s why today’s decision by the Ninth Circuit to rehear this case is critical; it is the next step in the defense of our state’s commonsense gun laws."" The 22 states have filed an amicus brief in support of the pro-gun rights side, arguing that it violates Americans’   right to bear arms. They say it bans the possession of arms even for self-defense, since the magazines that are banned are integral to some of the most popular firearms. ""California is trying to turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals simply for owning the magazines that come standard to many of the most popular firearms in our country,"" Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said in a statement. ""As radical leftist lawmakers in California and beyond persist in their attempts to legislatively overrule our constitutional rights, I will continue to stand strong in defense of our right to keep and bear arms."" The 22 states with Republican state attorney generals signed onto the amicus brief include Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia. Oral arguments are scheduled to begin on the case in June. The states argue that the right to bear arms protects those in disadvantaged communities, and in high-crime areas where law enforcement may be unable to respond in time to crimes being committed. ""California should not be allowed to invade its own citizens’ constitutional rights, and this Court should not imperil the rights of citizens in this Circuit and other states with its analysis,"" the brief says. California has argued that such a ban is necessary since guns with more than 10 rounds have been used in a number of mass shootings. California banned the manufacturing, sale and transfer of such magazines in 2000. But in 2016 the state tried to ban even the possession of those magazines. But it was struck down after the lawsuit, which was launched by the National Rifle Association and a coalition of gun owners. The review comes as   to act on gun control measures -- including a ban of large-capacity magazines, after shootings in Boulder, Colo., and Atlanta Georgia.  Biden urged Congress to ban ""assault weapons"" as well as high-capacity magazines.  ""I got that done as a senator. It brought down mass shootings, we can do it again,"" Biden said during remarks at the White House. ""We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/22-states-ninth-circuit-californias-large-capacity-magazine-ban

The then-president elect was caught on camera in November telling the pair ""in my Oval Office, mi casa, you casa,"" when it appears he meant to say ""mi casa es su casa,"" which means my house is your house. The flub took place at an early meeting about combating the pandemic. As  , it was Jill Biden this week who mispronounced the phrase ¡Sí Se Puede!"" ‒ which translates to ""Yes we can"" in Spanish ‒ during a speech in Delano, California honoring the birthday of labor leader and civil rights icon César Chávez. The phrase was popularized by Chávez and his United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta, and was used as a motto by the group in the  . It has also been adopted by other activist groups. Jill Biden did, however, pronounce the phrase correctly elsewhere in her speech. Politicians have been encouraged to learn Spanish, which is the second most common language in the U.S. DuoLingo announced in February that it had partnered with Voto Latino to urge newly-elected officials to continue efforts to learn Spanish beyond the campaign trail. However, there are many instances of misunderstanding translations as politicians attempt to learn the language. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, found himself in hot water after he quoted revolutionary leader Che Guevara during his unsuccessful campaign for the presidency. He used the phrase ""hasta la victoria, siempre,"" which means ""until victory, always"" and is associated with Guevara.

82,"Tucker Carlson: Biden's 'infrastructure plan' is not about infrastructure, but you'll still pay for it","If you watched   sputter through his announcement of   $2 trillion ""infrastructure plan,"" you may have been left with some questions. First, is this really about infrastructure? Bridges? Roads? Airports? Things we could actually use? Or is it yet another weird climate scheme/power grab/race-based redistribution plan? What exactly is this? And by the way, $2 trillion sounds like a lot for anything. Won’t that kind of spending cause hyperinflation? If you print money like it’s not worth anything, doesn’t the value of that money decline? Normal people may have had questions like that. Thankfully The   was on the scene to quell all doubt. The Times approached Biden’s plan with the calculated enthusiasm of   applauding yet another record Soviet potato harvest. ""Biden Plan Stresses Jobs, Roads, and Growth"" read one of the Times'   Thursday morning. ""$2 Trillion for 'Once in Generation' Fix of Infrastructure"" read another.  , the tech lobbyist-turned-White House chief of staff, was so grateful for the backup he tweeted out the front page himself. What does the future look like that Ron Klain wants to win? Well, let’s be clear from the outset that this plan will not make your commute easier. Only about 5% of that $2 trillion will actually go to roads and bridges. So, 5% on infrastructure, 95% on social engineering. That’s what Joe Biden calls a once-in-a-lifetime infrastructure bill. He’s right about part of it: It is once in a lifetime. If this passes, the next generation will life in a very different country. Before we tell you what’s in the bill, a word about who will pay for it. In fact, we only need one word: You. Taxes are going up dramatically. They didn’t have to, actually. Tax revenues no longer fund the ambition of our political class. The Federal Reserve does. When politicians want something, they just print the money. It’s called Modern Monetary Theory. They’ve been doing this for years, and it’s accelerating. There’s no actual reason to raise taxes anymore, for anything. But Joe Biden wants to, just to punish you. And he plans to do that. The administration is calling for a tax increase of about $3 trillion over ten years. That includes taxes on individual income and investments, as well as corporations. That would make this the first major tax hike in 28 years. But it's actually a much bigger tax increase than anything we saw under the Clinton administration. In 1993, taxes amounted to only around 0.5% of GDP. This plan would come to roughly three times that – about $300 billion a year, or 1.36% of GDP. You'd have to go back to 1968 to find a bigger tax increase. It’s a big deal. Have any questions? No questions allowed. Joe Biden doesn't want to answer questions. This is an emergency. And in emergencies, you do what you’re told. ""We can't afford not to spend $2 trillion,"" says Joe Biden, like the used car salesmen he is at heart. Biden knows he won’t be paying a dime. People like Joe Biden avoid taxes. Joe Biden himself avoids taxes, in fact. In 2017 and 2018, Joe Biden and his wife dodged payroll taxes on more than $13.3 million they earned through speaking fees and book royalties. How did they do that? The   reported that the Bidens ""classified the income as S-corporation profits rather than taxable wages."" Surprised? Come on. You also shouldn't believe a word about how corporations are going to pay for this. We’d support it if that was the case. But they’re not. Corporate interests put Biden in the White House. They designed his policy, they sign off on every part of it, just like the credit card companies in Delaware once did. They’ll be fine. Corporations shelter most of their money from taxes by passing the costs along to workers (in the form of lower wages) and customers (in the form of higher prices). That's not a secret. Economists know that, and so does Joe Biden. None of this will hurt Amazon, that’s why Amazon is for it. Joe Biden isn’t interesting in getting into those details, like the math. He’d like you to know that this bill is going to turn America into a scene from ""The Jetsons."" Flying cars? Teleport machines? Sadly not. We're going to ""modernize those highways."" Quite honestly, a lot of them could use it. But what does modernizing highways mean exactly?  A piece in The   gives us some idea. According to the Post, an activist by the name of Amy Stelly has been demanding the removal -- not the building, the removal -- of a highway that cuts through her neighborhood in the city of New Orleans. She thinks the highway, known as the Claiborne Expressway, is bad. It’s an eyesore and contributes to pollution. For years, she's demanded local leaders get rid of it. But they refused. People use it. It’s an important stretch of road. But now the White House, and Joe Biden's infrastructure plan, have decided that highway is an example of ""historic inequity"" that can be solved by ""billions in new spending."" In other words, it’s a racist highway, and we’ve got to pay to tear it down. Amy Stelly was enthused by this. ""I'm floored,"" she said. ""I’m thrilled to hear President Biden would call out the Claiborne Expressway as a racist highway."" Presumably, the highway is sexist, transphobic and dog whistles for White supremacy, not to mention QAnon insurrections. Gotta tear it down. Expect a lot more highways to meet this fate. People who believe highways are racist will get tens of billions of dollars as part of this plan, as long as they're in what the Biden administration calls ""underserved communities."" The entirety of this ""infrastructure plan"" is more like a mashup of intersectional theory from Weslyan and some kind of South Africa-style racial spoils system. We saw a taste of that earlier in the year, when Joe Biden sent billions of dollars to African-American farmers in this country purely because of how they looked. Now, that’s illegal, immoral and completely divisive, but it’s just the beginning. In his infrastructure bill, Joe Biden calls for sending $25 billion to ""historically [B]lack universities"" and other ""minority-serving institutions for research and development."" You may think it’s a good idea (and you should have to explain why), but it’s not infrastructure. He also wants to ""eliminate exclusionary zoning"" and ""needless barriers to producing affordable housing."" So your neighborhoods may have to make way for ""multi-family dwellings."" You don’t want multi-family dwellings in your neighborhood? Doesn’t matter. It’s equity. Shut up, racist. And there’s more where’re that came from. Joe Biden also wants $100 billion for workplace development to, ""reduce racial inequities in job training and hiring."" Huh? That doesn’t sound like eliminating racial discrimination in hiring, it sounds like mandating it. ""Wait a minute,"" you might be wondering. ""What does hiring people with certain skin colors have to do with infrastructure? Sorry to keep bringing us back to the point, but the point was supposed to be infrastructure."" It’s not, really. And Democrats aren’t really pretending it is anymore. Democrats are in charge, this is their chance to take total control of the economy, and they're going to use it. This is why you don't want the ""theory"" people in charge of anything. Sleazeball politicians of old would make the case: ""Vote for me and I’ll fix the potholes."" They may have stolen some of the money you sent them, but in the end, they had to fix the potholes. They promised they would, and your commute got a little better. These people are not about fixing the potholes. It's about ""saving our democracy"" and evolving into a ""multi-racial democracy,"" as if we don't have that already. It's also about something called the ""Green New Deal.""  And it's not simply one deranged theory-addled member of Congress admitting it. According to Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, former Mayor of South Bend, Rhodes Scholar and McKinsey consultant, we need this infrastructure bill to end hurricanes. . So according to climatologist Pete ... Hold on, we thought he was a McKinsey consultant? No, he’s a climate expert. Not even the climate experts understand the climate, that’s how complex it is, but Pete Buttigieg does, and he’s telling you it’s the roads that are causing hurricanes. We never had hurricanes before roads. He’s going to fix that. That explains why there's $46 billion in the bill for the federal government to buy electric vehicles. Now, FBI agents can arrest you for sedition while driving Teslas. ""But, wait a second,"" you ask. ""Aren’t those Teslas powered by electricity made in part by coal plants?"" Yeah, whatever. Shut up, insurrectionist. Another $2 trillion goes to tax credits for ""clean energy generation and storage."" I wonder who owns those firms. Could they be Biden donors? I think so. There's a plan for building 500,000 electric vehicle chargers, an allocation of $174 billion to expand the market of electric vehicles – no one wants to buy them, but the government is going to make you want to  buy them – and another $10 billion for a ""Climate Conservation Corps"" to ""boost climate resilience."" Are they going to buy umbrellas? That would be a useful form of climate resilience. But they’re thinking bigger than that. This is about transforming our democracy. You’ll notice that none of the spending goes towards aiding the oil workers put out of business when Joe Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. They can learn to code. According to the people who are really running the Democratic Party, though, none of this goes far enough. We’ve humiliated the Keystone XL workers and spent $2 trillion, but we need to go further. According to Sandy Cortez, pampered sciion of Westchester, we need to spend a lot more money or else you’re racist. Another math lecture from Sandy. She doesn’t care, by the way. None of them care about the consequences of this. What are the consequences of this, exactly? What happens if all this money gets into the system? Could it affect your life?  Take a look at a chart of commodity prices, and that will give you one sense. The government injected trillions of dollars into the economy, and what happened? The cost of almost every durable good, the things you need to live with, went way up. The price of lumber jumped more than 250%. Crude oil jumped 188%. Sugar, 50%.  Copper and tin went up by more than 80% each, and so on. It became a lot more expensive to live here. That’s fine if you’re Joe Biden or Sandy Cortez. Not fine if you’re you. The cost to buy a home jumped by 11%. According to the United Nations Food Price index, the cost of food has just reached its highest level in seven years. In other words, just by spending a lot of money they didn’t make, the people in charge are making it for much harder for most Americans to live here. That’s the cost of inflation. It’s a tax, and it’s insidious, and it’s impossible to control once it starts. Meanwhile, the most powerful people in the country have never been happier. The cost of apartments in San Francisco has gone way down. The Dow Jones is up by 50%.  Private equity is booming. Cryptocurrency investors are also seeing huge returns. Some of them have so much money they’re making up things to buy. They're investing in things called ""non-fungible tokens,"" or NFTs -- which are literally useless digital tokens. The Nyan Cat meme just sold for $590,000 in ""NFT format."" Now, it’s not the art that was sold. It’s the useless digital token.   if there ever was one. Those are the people who benefit from another $2 trillion in spending. And by the way, the tax increases won't offset all this spending. Joe Biden plans to tax what economists call ""savers,"" which don't bounce around as much in the economy. Taxing savers isn't an effective way to curb inflation, because the money isn't affecting as many transactions. It’s punitive. But the party in charge isn't concerned about inflation. They don't care if it's harder for you to get gas or buy dinner. They're just upset you feel so entitled to drive your vehicle to work on their roads. So the real problem with America is gas prices are too low. So people who don’t live in cities, people who drive for a living, just aren’t paying enough. That’s the problem, and those ungrateful Americans don’t even know it. What’s going on here? Trillions of dollars changing hands. This is looting. Just as their supporters did in Minneapolis last summer, the Biden people are looting the country. They’ve done nothing to build America. Susan Rice, Barack Obama, Ron Klain, and the rest of the people making these decisions haven’t created a single thing. They’re not creators. They’re takers, and they’ve gotten rich doing it. How much did Susan Rice make in the last few years, and how did she make that money? They’re just stripping the corpse. And when it falls apart, they’ll be gone. In the meantime, welcome to hyperinflation.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-infrastructure-bill-not-about-infrastructure
83,"Media root for Biden’s massive infrastructure plan, casting him as FDR","Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr
84,"Nets get strong debut from Aldridge, rout Hornets 111-89","LaMarcus Aldridge made his   debut and found playing in the post to be a breeze on a team so potent from the perimeter. ""It was easy for me, so I had fun tonight for sure,"" Aldridge said. Easy for the whole team, actually. Jeff Green outscored   by himself in Brooklyn's overpowering first quarter before finishing with 21 points, and the Nets got a strong first outing from Aldridge in a 111-89 rout of the Hornets on Thursday night. Aldridge started at center and had 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists, looking like a good fit for a Nets team that won for the 20th time in its last 23 games. They signed him last month after he reached a buyout agreement with San Antonio. With All-Stars Kevin Durant and James Harden sitting out with hamstring injuries, the Nets led 32-11 after one quarter behind 12 points from Green. A night earlier, they had to climb out of a 24-6 hole against Houston. ""Tonight we did just what we expected to do coming out of the gate,"" Green said. ""We got stops and defense turned into offense and that’s how we were able to get rolling."" The Nets made 20 3-pointers and put six players in double figures in their season-best seventh straight home win. Landry Shamet scored 17 points in his return from a five-game absence with a sprained right ankle and Kyrie Irving had 15 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Gordon Hayward and Devonte Graham each scored 13 points for Charlotte. Terry Rozier had 12. A game televised nationally on TNT was already watered down by the absences of some of its biggest stars, with Harden and Durant sidelined in Brooklyn and Hornets rookie LaMelo Ball lost to a broken right wrist. Those who still watched didn't have reason to do so for long, Charlotte missed 19 of its 23 shots in the first quarter. The Nets then began featuring Aldridge, who had seven points and assisted on the other basket in a 10-2 spurt that pushed the lead to 47-18 in the second quarter. Brooklyn led by 32 in the third quarter, when Charlotte had another miserable period with only 17 points. ""I mean, we just could not find any offensive rhythm,"" Hornets coach James Borrego said. ""It was a rough night on that end of the floor."" Harden left the Nets' victory over Houston on Wednesday with right hamstring tightness. Coach Steve Nash said Harden was day to day and should return within the next few games, but Durant's absence will last at least into next week. He's been out since mid-February with a strained left hamstring. Hornets: Malik Monk returned after a two-game absence with a sore right foot but had to be helped off the floor in the fourth quarter with what Borrego said was a sprained right ankle. He scored 11 points. Nets: Brooklyn rested Blake Griffin on the second night of the back-to-back. ... With Aldridge starting, DeAndre Jordan, the Nets' starting center in 36 of their first 48 games, didn't play. Durant spoke before the game and said he isn't in much pain and is looking forward to rejoining his teammates soon. He also   he used in private messages to Michael Rapaport that the actor shared on Twitter this week. Harden was voted Eastern Conference player of the month for March after also winning the award in February. He is the first player to win player of the month honors in both of his first two full months with a new team since the award’s inception in 1979-80. Ball won the Eastern Conference rookie of the month despite playing in just eight games. It was the third consecutive monthly win for the guard. Hornets: Visit Indiana on Friday.

85,"Trump, Biden, Fauci, Birx: Why finger-pointing is surging as COVID-19 cases rise","Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise

87,"California, New York localities push reparations through Universal Basic Income","Race-based universal basic income payments are starting to gain steam in the U.S. as a form of reparation. Last week, Marin County in California   payments of $1,000 per month for all women of color. In New York,   mayor has also suggested leveraging revenues from   legalization to pay reparations to Black and Brown residents. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren on Thursday sent a letter to a Latino-focused nonprofit requesting it to join her administration on an exploratory committee to look into the issue. Warren suggested utilizing a universal basic income (UBI) or home ownership program for assisting certain communities. ""Beyond changing policies and procedures, we must do more to close the wealth gap between Black and Brown people and our White residents,"" Warren said in the letter to the Ibero-American Action League. ""With marijuana legalization on the horizon in New York, we have an opportunity we never had before to bring real resources to bear to uplift our families and improve, not just their financial wellbeing, but their very future."" Marin County is contributing $400,000 to its program, with the remainder of the estimated $3 million coming from the Marin Community Foundation.  The program is slightly modeled after a similar one that ran from February 2019 to February 2020 in Stockton, California. The Marin County program, however, has a couple of conditions for residents to receive payments: recipients must be women of color and have a child under the age of 18. When asked by Fox News for comment on the program and whether or not the Marin Community Foundation believed the program was discriminatory, foundation president and CEO Thomas Peters said that this ""initial program"" is directed at women of color who carry a ""double-weighted burden in their path to self-sufficiency."" He also said the reason to target women of color specifically was ""not for any reason of exclusion, but because we are laser-focused on an area of greatest need."" ""Our pilot program is the next phase in a research study we conducted last year focused on low-income Moms who are struggling to care for their families and better their educational and economic standing.  No surprise but still quite dismaying, we found that the women who are grappling with the most serious difficulties of all are Moms of color, who face not only financial challenges but the daily imposition of overt and covert discrimination,"" said Peters. Warren's letter comes after last week's report by the Commission on Racial and Structural Equity, which argued that racism is ""deeply embedded in the culture and practices of Rochester and Monroe County."" The report   that it found hardly any laws in the city and county ""which created and sustained racist policies.""  However, the commission added they had found ""practices and conditions where diversity of race, ethnicity and gender are nearly non-existent; where people of color are unable to fully participate and are implicitly or explicitly excluded from opportunities that could enhance their economic, social and mental health; and where people of color are denied the opportunity to participate in the rule-making and decision-making that shapes our lives, from birth to death."" According to Warren's letter, the exploratory committee would review UBI and reparation pilot programs in other cities. It specifically mentions Evanston, Illinois, and   both of which are pursuing monetary assistance for Black families. In Oakland, the payments consist of $500 in monthly payments for 18 months to 600 families who are Black, indigenous, or people of color. Mayor Warren's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/california-new-york-reparations-universal-basic-income

It, it, there could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the — that it was Russian intelligence. It could be that it was stolen from me."" Hunter Biden's answer at least partially contradicts a comment President Biden made as recently as December that he thought the laptop and the information on it were the products of a Russian smear campaign.  ""Yes. Yes. Yes,"" Biden told Fox News' Peter Doocy on Dec. 22 when asked if he thought the laptop was Russian disinformation. ""God love ya man. You are a one horse pony."" In a separate interview with CBS, Hunter Biden delved into how his family's handled his addiction troubles, including telling the story of a time his father chased him down the family's driveway to keep him from leaving an intervention.  ""And your father chased you?"" CBS' Mason asked Biden.  ""Yeah, because I tried to get into ­— I tried to go to my car,"" Hunter responded. ""And my girls literally blocked the door to my car. Said, ‘Dad, Dad, please. You can’t. No, no.’ This was the hardest part of the book to write."" ""And he grabbed me in a hug,"" Hunter continued, referring to his father. 'He grabbed me, gave a bear hug, and he said — and just cried and said, ‘I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. Please —’"" At that moment, Hunter Biden told CBS, he struggled to appreciate the gesture because of the grip of his addiction. ""I thought, ‘I need to figure out a way to tell him that I’m going to do something so that I can go take another hit,’"" Biden said. He added: ""It’s the only thing I could think. Literally. That’s how powerful. I don’t know of a force more powerful than my family’s love. Except addiction."" The full in-depth interviews, set to air on Sunday and Monday, will also include information about the Department of Justice investigation into Hunter Biden and more, according to CBS.  The interviews come ahead of the publication of Hunter's book titled ""Beautiful Things"" later this month. President Biden has said he   his son's book deal. ",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/hunter-biden-laptop-father-chased-him-drug-intervention
91,Poll shows voter ID laws overwhelmingly popular among Americans,"New polling data shows that almost three out of four Americans approve of voter identification laws. The Associated Press released new polling data on Friday that illustrated the fact that the majority of Americans are behind laws requiring photo identification to access the ballot box. The data show the vast majority of Republicans are in favor of requiring an ID to vote with over half of Democrats joining them in backing the idea. Only 24% of Democrats opposed the laws. Overall, 72% of American adults approve of requiring photo identification to vote, illuminating a sharp contrast between Democratic voters and the message the party has been pushing in the wake of Georgia’s new voting law. Georgia has taken center stage in the voter ID battle, where critics of the new law say it suppresses the vote. Progressives say that voter ID laws   the ability of minorities to vote and that the laws are racist.  The Peach State's new law expands early voting access by requiring two Saturdays of early voting as well as two optional Sundays. Additionally, it creates a mandate for vote drop boxes to be placed in each county in Georgia and requires that voters show a state-issued driver's license or ID card. Multiple political and business leaders have spoken out against the law. President   recently   four ""Pinocchios"" from The Washington Post for repeating the false claim that the law ""ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over.""",Politics,https://www.foxnews.com//politics/voter-id-poll-americans-approve-georgia-bill
